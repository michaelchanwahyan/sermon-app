1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
 - For freedom in the history of our nation.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,560
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,080
 - Dallas and Fort Worth, we're advancing the state of the art

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,100
 in every aspect.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:22,820
 - How we doing?

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,000
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,640
 Come on, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,080
 I just kind of start with some transparency.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,080
 I feel like I secretly want to be like James Bond.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,600
 And here's why I say that,

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,120
 because I just kind of have this weird fantasy

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,840
 of having like a lot of guns, okay?

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,740
 Don't judge me.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,360
 But like just like this like secret room full of guns

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,940
 or like you push a button and the wall opens up

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,880
 and there's, and like I have a gun.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,780
 I've got a couple guns, but I want like better guns.

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,040
 And what's interesting about that

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,940
 is I don't even use the guns I have,

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,820
 but like I just kind of have this idea

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,140
 that like somebody's gonna break into the house, you know?

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,360
 I'm gonna be like, yo, just push a button,

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,580
 wall opens up, you know?

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,580
 It's like AR-15s, AK-47s, like nine millimeters,

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,660
 row of 40s and you know, and I'm like,

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,920
 it's a bad idea, bro.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,220
 And they're like, what's that?

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,080
 I'm like, that's a missile launcher.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,400
 (congregation laughing)

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,280
 You better back, you chose the wrong house, you know?

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,260
 And so like I want like, I want better guns,

32
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,160
 but what's crazy and why I say that is because

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 like I don't even hunt or shoot or hold gun.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,760
 I don't do anything with guns,

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,760
 but I want like a better version of something that I have

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,140
 and I don't use properly.

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,960
 You catch that?

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,680
 Like I want a better, let me go one more with you ladies,

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,400
 just in case I haven't completely lost you.

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,860
 Let me try to lose you some more.

41
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,020
 So tools, okay?

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,920
 I have some tools, but like I'm the kind of guy

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,160
 that like calls a handyman to change the light bulb.

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,700
 Like I don't use the tools, okay?

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,940
 I don't use the tools I have,

46
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,240
 but every time I get an ad, like a Black Friday

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,180
 or like Home Depot ad, I'm like, dude,

48
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,080
 I need some more tools, that's what I need.

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,660
 I need a better Sawzall, but like I've never used my Sawzall,

50
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,920
 but I need a better one with a lithium battery.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,360
 I need a better version of this tool that I have

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,360
 that I don't use.

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,600
 And I'm not talking about materialism tonight.

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,800
 I'm not talking about things or stuff.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,540
 I'm talking about your job.

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,680
 Because your job, the one you went to today,

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,040
 I think for the vast majority of us

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,040
 is a tool that we have that we don't use.

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,920
 And we want a better one.

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,180
 You're talking to me like we want a better job,

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,200
 which whatever better means to us,

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,540
 like probably a higher paying job,

63
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,680
 different responsibilities, more authority.

64
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,560
 We want a better job, but we don't use this tool,

65
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,500
 our current job that we have,

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,280
 and we want a better version of it.

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,960
 And what's interesting about a tool

68
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,380
 is a tool can be used to build up,

69
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,080
 or a tool can be used to tear down.

70
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,680
 A hammer can build a house or destroy a life.

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,120
 And likewise, so can your job.

72
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,120
 It can build up your life, or it can destroy it.

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,900
 And what you don't need is a different one.

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,440
 You need a new perspective on the one that you have.

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,440
 That you would use it in the way that God has intended.

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,640
 I'm gonna present some things to you tonight

77
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,080
 from the Bible.

78
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,380
 That God, the creator, the heavens, the earth,

79
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,280
 has instructed us about our work,

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,340
 and you're going to come to a crossroads

81
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,020
 at the end of this evening.

82
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,320
 You're going to have to decide, is he right,

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,240
 or is he wrong?

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,900
 Because I think for the vast majority of you,

85
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,020
 you're gonna hear some new things, some new ideas.

86
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,760
 And for some of you, you're just gonna be at a crossroad.

87
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,760
 Do I need to put this into practice tomorrow or not?

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,600
 Or do I just wanna say, hey, I reject that.

89
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,160
 I don't think that's what those scriptures mean.

90
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,740
 I don't know that that's what's going on there.

91
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,600
 But we will have to decide, because our work is a tool.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,220
 We're in this series, New Year Revolution.

93
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,680
 We're talking about how the changes that people make

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
 that change the world.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,460
 Resolutions change people, revolutions change the world.

96
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,040
 And so if we wanna change the world,

97
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,060
 we need to come up with this revolutionary idea

98
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,840
 around work, which is really just God's ancient idea

99
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,580
 around the one who created work and created us to work.

100
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,340
 And so week one, two weeks ago,

101
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,200
 we talked about freedom that comes from following Jesus.

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,140
 We were in John chapter 10.

103
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,900
 Last week, David talked about how Christianity

104
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,780
 is not optional for the world,

105
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,260
 and the Holy Spirit is not optional for the Christian.

106
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,140
 And we're talking about this kind of background idea

107
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,100
 of a biblical worldview,

108
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,420
 and that we're going through this world

109
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,180
 and we're following something greater than ourselves.

110
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,180
 And tonight, I want to talk about seeing work as a tool.

111
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,000
 Not seeing your boss as a tool.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,740
 Seeing work, seeing work as a tool.

113
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,620
 And so if we get the why we work question wrong,

114
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,340
 the why we work question wrong,

115
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,740
 you're gonna go through life like so many of your peers,

116
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,900
 and you're gonna find yourself desperate

117
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,900
 and wanting and depressed.

118
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,720
 I think more desperation and depression

119
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,820
 comes from a false idea of why we work

120
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,800
 than almost just about anything else I can think of.

121
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,980
 I believe our generation is notorious for this,

122
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,360
 and it's not entirely your fault.

123
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,420
 I think you've been set up for failure,

124
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,740
 and I hope to change that tonight.

125
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,820
 I'm very hopeful of the message tonight.

126
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,780
 I think if we can embrace a biblical concept of work

127
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,940
 for the rest of your years on earth,

128
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,460
 you will be set up for incredible success,

129
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,540
 and a new understanding,

130
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,940
 something that you can teach others.

131
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,380
 So I asked if you follow,

132
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,460
 if we're friends on Twitter or Instagram

133
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,800
 or social media in general,

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,660
 I asked that you bring a pen and a piece of paper tonight,

135
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,740
 'cause there's just gonna be a ton of scriptures.

136
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,380
 I'm gonna go throw them at you.

137
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,940
 You're gonna see that God has a lot to say about this.

138
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,900
 There's over 900 passages

139
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,300
 around work and economics in the scripture.

140
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,900
 That is more than heaven or hell, evangelism,

141
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,060
 missions, dating, marriage, conflict,

142
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,140
 raising children combined.

143
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,540
 There's more passages in the Bible on this idea of work

144
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,980
 than all of those other topics combined,

145
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,980
 because God really cares about work.

146
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,140
 He really cares about this.

147
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,720
 There's something that he wants you to know

148
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,100
 that I think for so many of us, we've missed it.

149
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,900
 And missing it will destroy your life.

150
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,580
 I mean that, not that you have the wrong job,

151
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,820
 but you have the wrong perspective

152
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,380
 of the job you currently have.

153
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,060
 And that will mess you up.

154
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,700
 I've seen it mess up a lot of people.

155
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,540
 So I hope you lean in,

156
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,220
 and I hope you hang on to what you can.

157
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,020
 It's gonna be like drinking from a fire hydrant tonight.

158
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,540
 Write down what you can.

159
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,940
 You can stay at 30,000 foot view if you want,

160
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,100
 and talk about it afterwards.

161
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,420
 We have affinity groups, and you can just say,

162
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,560
 "Hey, let me make sure I heard that right,

163
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,380
 "and hey, what did you think about this, and do you agree,

164
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,600
 "and what scripture did he say?"

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,980
 And you can go back and look at it.

166
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,140
 So we're gonna talk about how your job is a tool to praise,

167
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,260
 how your job is a tool to prune,

168
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,440
 how your job is a tool to provide,

169
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,740
 and how your job is a tool to promote.

170
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,940
 Four points this evening.

171
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,340
 And so let me just start with your job is a tool to praise.

172
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,020
 Praise means worship.

173
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,780
 So many of us think what we just did as worship,

174
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,580
 we compartmentalize this idea of worship,

175
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,960
 but your job is your greatest opportunity to worship God.

176
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,100
 Now that's a big statement.

177
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,920
 Is it true?

178
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
 Can I prove it?

179
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,100
 Hey, let me start with a couple verses for you.

180
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,460
 Exodus 34, verse 21 says,

181
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,260
 "Six days you shall," and the word is labor there.

182
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,440
 Psalm 104, verse 23 says,

183
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,100
 "Then people go out to their," and the word is work.

184
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,980
 And then Exodus 8, verse 1 says,

185
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,420
 "This is what the Lord says,

186
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,260
 "let my people go so that they may,"

187
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,940
 and the word is worship me.

188
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,400
 And then Joshua 24, verse 15 says,

189
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,360
 "But as for me and my household, we will,"

190
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,780
 and the word is serve the Lord.

191
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,680
 Now you can learn a lot about words.

192
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,000
 Okay, when one thing, an item, a noun,

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,640
 has a bunch of words to describe it,

194
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,720
 that's intentional in a language.

195
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,780
 And when one word describes lots of things,

196
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,540
 that is also intentional.

197
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,340
 Let's throw that back up there for just a minute.

198
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,540
 All of those words in the Hebrew

199
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,660
 is the Hebrew word avodah.

200
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,660
 Avodah, they're all the same word.

201
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,720
 Labor, work, worship, and serve.

202
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
 God says, "They're all the same in my economy.

203
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,520
 "What you did today was an act of worship."

204
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,000
 And you think, "No, no, no, when I was singing,

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
 "'Praise the King of,' that was an act of worship."

206
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
 It was for Shane B.

207
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,120
 The Shane's in campuses, Fort Worth, Houston,

208
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,820
 wherever you're at, if you heard a worship leader,

209
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,560
 yeah, that was their work.

210
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,480
 And that was worship.

211
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,920
 And yeah, we got to take part in that worship by singing.

212
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,920
 But what you did today, I will argue, from the Scriptures,

213
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
 was more of an act of worship.

214
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,640
 Wherever you showed up corporately, commercially,

215
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,560
 that that was a greater act of worship.

216
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,620
 You don't believe me.

217
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,000
 It's kind of one of those things, like,

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 "Oh yeah, preachers are supposed to say stuff like that."

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
 I'm sure that's probably true.

220
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,120
 No, it is knitted in who we are as human beings.

221
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,200
 Let me try to prove it.

222
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,560
 In Genesis chapter two, verse 15,

223
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,120
 God put man in the garden and he says,

224
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,600
 "I want you to work it."

225
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
 Not like work it, but like work it.

226
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
 (congregation laughing)

227
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,040
 I want you to work it.

228
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
 I want you to work.

229
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,840
 What's interesting about that being Genesis chapter two

230
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,760
 is that's before Genesis chapter three,

231
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,400
 which is when sin entered the world.

232
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,080
 So prior to sin entered the world,

233
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,360
 in perfection that God created, work existed.

234
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,880
 And we were made in God's image.

235
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,320
 God worked for six days, rested on the seventh,

236
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,080
 made humans in his image to be a part of who he is

237
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,120
 that we would work.

238
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,320
 A part of who we are is work.

239
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120
 It's not something we do.

240
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,660
 It's intrinsically in us.

241
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,560
 What do I mean by intrinsically in us?

242
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,520
 It's not a means to an end.

243
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,120
 To not to work is to not live.

244
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,920
 Once you cease to work, you begin to die.

245
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,920
 You begin to cease to exist as God intended you to exist.

246
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,280
 Work is who we are as human beings.

247
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,560
 We're to work.

248
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,120
 It is worship.

249
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,980
 It is praise.

250
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,600
 It is what God made us to do.

251
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,040
 And so as we move through the scriptures,

252
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,360
 what you see most often in the New Testament

253
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,800
 as an employee-employer relationship

254
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,100
 is some words that we have tremendous baggage with.

255
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,200
 It's slave master, slave master.

256
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,800
 And we see that through the lens

257
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,380
 of our gross, disgusting history in America

258
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,920
 of a racial slavery, slaves coming over from Africa

259
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,600
 to work, the abuse that took place there,

260
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,680
 the injustice, inhumane acts that took place there.

261
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,920
 This was not a racial slavery.

262
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,160
 It is what we have closest to a employee-employer

263
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
 relationship in the scriptures.

264
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,900
 And you say, if I heard that as a 20-something,

265
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,380
 I'd be like, oh, okay, yeah, maybe,

266
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,400
 but it's not what it is.

267
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,040
 But you gotta think about why it is so often repeated

268
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,900
 throughout the New Testament.

269
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,720
 Why would God give us so much instructions

270
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,780
 on how to be slaves?

271
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,360
 You'll hear the Bible condones slavery,

272
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,700
 not the slavery that we think about.

273
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,600
 No, it's not, and it's not condoning anything.

274
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,400
 It's giving instruction to this is how you're to have

275
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,040
 a relationship with someone who is in authority over you.

276
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
 And if you find yourself in a place of authority,

277
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
 this is how you're to act.

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
 So let me read you two scriptures.

279
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,720
 Ephesians chapter six, verses five through nine.

280
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,320
 Slaves, obey your earthly masters.

281
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,640
 I want you to read that.

282
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,160
 Employees, obey your employers with respect and fear

283
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,880
 and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.

284
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,640
 Obey them not only to win favor when their eye is on you,

285
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,560
 but as slaves of Christ,

286
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,520
 doing the will of God from your heart.

287
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,820
 Serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving the Lord,

288
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,320
 not people, because you know that the Lord will reward

289
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,560
 each one for whatever good they do,

290
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,160
 whether they are a slave or free.

291
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,720
 And masters, treat your slaves.

292
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,600
 Now, if you find yourself in a position of authority

293
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,400
 over someone, employers, treat your employees

294
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,720
 in the same way.

295
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,680
 Do not threaten them since you know that he

296
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,520
 who is both their master and yours is in heaven

297
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,400
 and there is no favoritism with him.

298
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,800
 Now that was Paul writing to a specific church

299
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,140
 in a town called Ephesus.

300
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,140
 Now, Paul also wrote to a church in a city called Colossae.

301
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,600
 Let me read it to you.

302
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,760
 It's going to sound familiar.

303
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,040
 Written at two different times to two different churches

304
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
 in two different geographic locations,

305
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,320
 God, through his Holy Spirit and his servant Paul,

306
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,700
 scribed two letters that he preserved in the Bible

307
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,200
 for thousands of years so that we would read them today

308
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,040
 and apply them to our lives.

309
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:30,120
 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything

310
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,440
 and do it not only when their eye is on you

311
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,640
 and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart

312
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,900
 and reverence for the Lord.

313
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,480
 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart

314
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,220
 as working for the Lord, not for human masters.

315
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,480
 Since you know that you will receive an inheritance

316
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,140
 from the Lord as a reward,

317
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,040
 it is the Lord Christ you are serving.

318
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,100
 Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs

319
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,160
 and there is no favoritism.

320
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,880
 It's almost verbatim, the same passage

321
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,640
 written two different times, two different letters,

322
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,800
 two different churches, two different geographic locations.

323
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,240
 It's like God saying, can I have your attention, please?

324
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,080
 I have something I want you to know.

325
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,860
 You're not working for your boss.

326
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,000
 I see you.

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
 I know what you're doing.

328
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
 I know how you're working.

329
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,720
 And it is an act of worship to me.

330
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,840
 And I see the way you treat each other.

331
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,120
 And I see what you think about your coworkers.

332
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,080
 And I see what you say behind their back.

333
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,720
 And you need to stop it

334
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,120
 because it's an act of worship to me.

335
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,180
 The message is simple.

336
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,920
 Work with excellence for God, not for man.

337
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,040
 Treat each other well.

338
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,160
 And I know it's a different message to swallow

339
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
 'cause you're like, what if my job sucks?

340
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,400
 You work with excellence.

341
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,720
 What if my boss is terrible?

342
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,440
 You work with excellence.

343
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
 What if I'm doing the same thing and I never get promoted?

344
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
 God sees you.

345
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
 There's this place called eternity.

346
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,700
 You're gonna be there for a long time.

347
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,440
 Better to get promoted there than here anyways.

348
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,840
 He's dishing out the rewards.

349
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,040
 That's what he's saying over and over and over.

350
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
 Do we believe him?

351
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,440
 Do we believe him that that's better?

352
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,120
 Can't be that simple.

353
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,400
 I know it's not popular, but it's biblical.

354
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,240
 And so work is a form of worship.

355
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,200
 It's not an object of worship.

356
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,040
 It's a form.

357
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,240
 We don't worship our work.

358
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
 We worship through our work.

359
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
 And so my second point is your job is a tool to prune.

360
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,200
 Your job is a tool to prune.

361
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
 What do I mean by prune?

362
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,320
 You know, this is a metaphor Jesus gives us in John 15

363
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,560
 that the Holy Spirit is actively sanctifying us.

364
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,200
 He is turning us into him.

365
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,520
 Essentially, he's making us like Christ.

366
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,920
 And he does that through trials,

367
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,960
 circumstance, tribulations, hardships in this life.

368
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,280
 He does that, as the Proverbs says,

369
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,680
 as iron sharpens iron through other people.

370
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,520
 We are becoming like Jesus.

371
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,600
 And so your work is an incredible tool

372
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
 that the Holy Spirit uses to prune you

373
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,520
 so that fruit would come out of your life.

374
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,240
 First Peter chapter two, verse 13 says it like this.

375
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
 Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake

376
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,000
 to every human authority,

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,760
 whether to the emperor as the supreme authority

378
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
 or to governors who are sent by him

379
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,680
 to punish those who do wrong

380
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,840
 and to commend those who do right.

381
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,720
 For it is God's will that by doing,

382
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,880
 listen, this is important,

383
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,360
 by doing good, you should silence

384
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,080
 the ignorant talk of foolish people.

385
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,920
 Live as free people.

386
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,200
 Do not use your freedom as a coverup for evil.

387
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,640
 Live as God's slaves.

388
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,440
 We see this idea again, same words, God's slaves.

389
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,040
 Show proper respect to everyone.

390
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,680
 Love the family of believers.

391
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,120
 Fear God, honor the emperor,

392
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
 applicable, very applicable to your Facebook post.

393
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,040
 Slaves, in reverent fear of God,

394
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,080
 submit yourselves to your masters,

395
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,960
 not only to those who are good and considerate,

396
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,400
 but also to those who are harsh.

397
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,080
 Now, what is so interesting is one,

398
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,360
 the scriptures acknowledge this slave master relationship

399
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,640
 that there can be harshness

400
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,120
 that exists in that relationship.

401
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,480
 So there's certainly abusive situations.

402
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
 And as it repeats this slave master relationship,

403
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 what it doesn't ever say,

404
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,680
 and you gotta find this curious,

405
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,920
 it never says,

406
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,360
 and if they're abusive, leave.

407
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,240
 And if they're really difficult to work with,

408
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
 you should go somewhere else.

409
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,560
 He never said, look for another opportunity.

410
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,640
 It gives zero allotment for that.

411
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,680
 Like he never, ever gives instruction

412
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,880
 that if it's a terrible work environment, get out.

413
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,760
 Why?

414
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,000
 What is he doing there?

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,080
 Now, it's a very simple capitalistic mindset

416
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,800
 for us to exist in a world where,

417
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,640
 hey, if we have a job and we don't like it,

418
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,040
 another one comes along, we should go.

419
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,920
 That's just A to B simple logic in America today.

420
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,480
 It's not biblical.

421
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,640
 Some of you are gonna be wrestling with that

422
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,480
 for the rest of the night.

423
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,920
 So make a note, try to move forward with me,

424
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
 come back, we can argue later.

425
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,000
 But he never gives that ground.

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,120
 What is he doing here?

427
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,080
 So typically, we're representatives,

428
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,120
 we're ambassadors of Christ.

429
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
 Typically when you leave a job,

430
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
 it doesn't leave a great taste in your boss's mouth.

431
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,280
 Like he's not like, and I'm so glad you're leaving.

432
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,640
 If it does, you were doing something terribly wrong

433
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,080
 and have failed your mission there.

434
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,240
 And so for some of us, right, we might need to quit.

435
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,120
 Now listen, we might need to quit our jobs

436
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,280
 because we're not spiritually mature enough to stay there.

437
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,800
 And what I mean by that is we cannot represent

438
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,880
 Christ well there.

439
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
 We haven't gotten to that place where we're so surrendered

440
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,240
 to the Holy Spirit that we can be there with joy

441
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,720
 and suffer with joy.

442
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,640
 And so we may need to leave because we just can't,

443
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,600
 but we should start there.

444
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,960
 We just can't, I just can't live out my calling.

445
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,000
 I'm not spiritually mature enough to do so.

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I've gotta go find something else.

447
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,680
 But for the vast majority of us, God is still sovereign.

448
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,760
 And he placed you where you woke up this morning

449
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,120
 and you have a purpose there.

450
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,040
 And before you look for a better tool,

451
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,760
 make sure you're appropriately using the one you have,

452
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,080
 your job, right?

453
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,560
 And so I think like what we do is we get into something,

454
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,640
 it gets hard, we jump out.

455
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,200
 We get into something, it gets hard, we jump out.

456
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,680
 We get into something, it gets hard, we jump out.

457
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,480
 I did this, guys.

458
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,880
 I did that.

459
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,200
 Got a job.

460
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
 You know, it's always your dream job.

461
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 I can't tell you how many times I've had that conversation.

462
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
 Oh man, it's my dream job.

463
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,640
 I love it so much.

464
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,480
 Hey, you still working there?

465
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,520
 No, man, it was terrible.

466
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,760
 (congregation laughing)

467
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,640
 It always happens.

468
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,000
 And so I had my dream job for three months

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
 and then to learn it was terrible.

470
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,080
 Had another dream job for three months

471
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,280
 to learn that it was terrible.

472
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,160
 Jumped in another job for six months

473
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
 to learn that it was terrible.

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,560
 Can I tell you something about the season of my life?

475
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,160
 I was stagnant.

476
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,840
 There was no growth there.

477
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,360
 I was a brat.

478
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,880
 I can look back on that season, zero growth.

479
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,720
 Same thing with relationship.

480
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,360
 You jump in a relationship, it gets hard, you jump out.

481
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,600
 You jump in a relationship, it gets hard, you jump out.

482
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 You jump in a relationship.

483
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
 Nobody grows that way.

484
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,800
 Nobody grows it.

485
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,320
 You sit right where you're at and you stay there.

486
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,160
 You never grow.

487
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,080
 That's why to grow, to become great at something

488
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,640
 takes perseverance and practice

489
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,880
 and you gotta stay with it when you don't feel like it.

490
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,560
 That's what it takes to get good at something.

491
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,920
 This is why I tell my children,

492
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,880
 like, hey, you can play any sport you want,

493
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,800
 but you start, you're gonna finish the season.

494
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,640
 Why?

495
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,160
 Because they're not gonna like it at some point.

496
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,200
 They're gonna get there, have to run horses or gassers

497
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,040
 or run something or do something terrible.

498
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,280
 And they're gonna be like, that was terrible, I'm out.

499
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,680
 We all have come across this.

500
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,120
 And then you quit and then your life is marked by changing

501
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,040
 and changing and changing and changing.

502
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,480
 And no one becomes great at anything by changing.

503
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,000
 And that's what they're saying about us,

504
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,880
 that we're jack of all trades and masters of none.

505
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
 That's what they're saying about our generation.

506
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,560
 Because we're just constantly changing.

507
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,760
 We're learning new things, but we're not mastering anything.

508
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,760
 We're not artists because we can put colors on canvases.

509
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,960
 We're artists when we can create and recreate

510
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
 beautiful images.

511
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,240
 Shane B or wherever you're at, your worship leader,

512
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,540
 he didn't learn to play the guitar on YouTube.

513
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,960
 No, he went to classes and he stuck with it.

514
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
 And when he didn't feel like going, he still went.

515
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,620
 And he became a master at something.

516
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,040
 Master, to master something, you have to stick with it

517
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,500
 through that wall of, I don't feel like it.

518
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,760
 I don't want to.

519
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,520
 Because if you don't, you might be naturally good

520
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,440
 at something, you will never be great at anything.

521
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,560
 At anything.

522
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,500
 To get great at something, you have to practice it.

523
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,400
 And you know what we're great at?

524
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,400
 We're great at justifying leaving because we practiced it.

525
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,240
 Like some of you, you haven't even moved on,

526
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
 you're still thinking, wait, wait,

527
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,460
 is he saying I can never leave?

528
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,840
 Like I gotta stay there?

529
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,760
 Certainly there's a certain situation where I leave,

530
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,480
 we're so good at justifying.

531
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,960
 What if my boss asked me to sin?

532
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,920
 If they force you to sin, leave,

533
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,640
 but not if your boss is a sinner,

534
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
 because he is, she is, they are.

535
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,700
 But yeah, yeah, if they're saying, hey,

536
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,480
 you can choose to sin or you can choose to quit, you quit.

537
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,200
 That's applicable to about .2% of you.

538
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
 Maybe .02% of you.

539
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,280
 The rest of us, we're so good at justifying the leave.

540
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,400
 And so this comes from John 15, verse two,

541
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,860
 this idea of pruning every branch that does bear fruit,

542
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,200
 he prunes so that you will be even more fruitful.

543
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,360
 The pruning process doesn't feel good,

544
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,640
 it's not a feel good process, right?

545
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,600
 And so you have very few tools in your life

546
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,280
 to prune you right now.

547
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,960
 I'm just telling you, think about the tools

548
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,020
 that you have to prune you right now.

549
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,280
 Like you have maybe a relationship,

550
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,260
 if you're dating someone who's brutally honest with you

551
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,400
 and they will look you in the eyes

552
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,600
 and tell you why they don't wanna go on that second date,

553
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,320
 that's loving, that can be pruning.

554
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
 A roommate who's honest with you,

555
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,280
 a Christ following roommate is a great opportunity

556
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
 to be pruned, to sit you down and say,

557
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,920
 here's why you need to start doing the dishes

558
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,240
 or like stop being so gross or something like that,

559
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,580
 that can be pruning.

560
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,580
 But as I think about it, like the greatest opportunity

561
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,500
 you have for pruning is a boss,

562
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,180
 especially a difficult one.

563
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:06,980
 And so like, as I look back on the biggest season

564
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,080
 of my life, the greatest tool that I had for sanctification

565
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,460
 was an unbelieving boss.

566
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,920
 And so I need to apologize to you guys for something,

567
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,400
 because I've even taught the message,

568
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,300
 and I can rally you guys, like I've done it,

569
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,240
 I do this, right?

570
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,380
 The follow your passion message.

571
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:35,720
 Like the Venn diagram, like, hey, here's what you're good at

572
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,680
 and here's the greatest needs in the world

573
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,920
 and here's what you're passionate about

574
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,300
 and find the overlap and do that.

575
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,840
 I think I've even said that.

576
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,640
 The problem with that is unbiblical,

577
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,720
 like show me follow your passion.

578
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,720
 I see work hard in the grind, like stick with it.

579
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,960
 Even when your boss is harsh, like honor the Lord

580
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,440
 because it's an act of worship,

581
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,680
 but the follow your passion, that'll preach.

582
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,140
 And I can tell you, hey, be creative and start a one-for-one

583
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,480
 like Tom's or Roma Boots or Warby Parker.

584
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,940
 And the world doesn't need another one-for-one business.

585
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,720
 The world needs faithful Christians

586
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,360
 who will stick with it in the grind.

587
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,300
 That they will do what is asked of them.

588
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,520
 Better than everybody else in the name of the Lord Jesus

589
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,000
 because they know it's Jesus Christ they are serving.

590
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,120
 And I know that's a little bit less inspiring

591
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,040
 than if I stood up here and I was like,

592
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,540
 follow your passions.

593
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,080
 Did you know that follow your passions,

594
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,880
 that phrase was virtually non-existent until 1980.

595
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,540
 Now, if you're here and you're a millennial,

596
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,160
 you were born between 1980 and 2000,

597
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,640
 we've grown up under the banner of follow your passion.

598
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,100
 Before 1980, virtually it was in no print, no book.

599
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,680
 It didn't exist.

600
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,520
 Your grandfather did not follow his passions.

601
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,480
 He didn't even follow his wiring.

602
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,500
 He didn't wake up and like,

603
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,840
 hey, what am I supposed to do?

604
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
 Your great-grandfather, you know what?

605
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,520
 You know what, I guess I'll take StrengthsFinder

606
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,040
 and find out what my five biggest strengths are.

607
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,600
 Myers-Briggs and disc, and maybe I'm a lion

608
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,200
 or an otter or a beaver, I don't know, what should I do?

609
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,040
 He didn't do that.

610
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,880
 He was like, you know what I'm gonna do?

611
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,000
 I'm a farm 'cause there's a tractor

612
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,080
 and this needs to be farmed, so let me get in that.

613
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,520
 He never asked the question that we're asking.

614
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,760
 And his circumstance wasn't nearly as good as yours,

615
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,320
 but his satisfaction, what's higher?

616
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,600
 What's happened?

617
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,520
 'Cause you would think with all of these tasks

618
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,120
 and these assessments that we could take

619
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,560
 and all this consideration that can not only like match.com,

620
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,120
 match us with our perfect partner, eHarmony, whatever,

621
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
 but match us with our perfect job based on who we are

622
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,160
 and we spend so much time thinking about that.

623
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,400
 What was I created to do?

624
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,880
 You were created to work.

625
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,260
 That's what you were created to do.

626
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,260
 So do it well with excellence in the grind.

627
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,340
 And so you're thinking right now, yeah, JP,

628
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,420
 well, you get to do your job.

629
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,780
 What, this?

630
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,580
 You get to follow your passion.

631
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,420
 This?

632
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:06,700
 This is two hours of my 55-hour week.

633
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,580
 For two hours, I get to shout at you

634
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,140
 in the name of Jesus Christ.

635
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,220
 (congregation laughing)

636
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,740
 I'll leave here.

637
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,020
 I'm gonna have 100 emails from you.

638
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,620
 People are gonna say very mean things.

639
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,420
 They're gonna say your glasses were stupid.

640
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,620
 That's what I'm gonna get.

641
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,180
 And I'm gonna read it.

642
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,420
 You know, I'm gonna pray for you.

643
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,140
 I'm gonna try not to get discouraged

644
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,020
 and I'm gonna go back and tell somebody else about Jesus.

645
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,900
 I'm gonna sit with the sick and the hurting.

646
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,580
 And that's how I, this is not how I spend my week.

647
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,140
 I mean, nevermind the 15 hours

648
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,320
 of preparing for what you see.

649
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,900
 The grind.

650
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,260
 The grind.

651
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,860
 Honor God in the grind.

652
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,020
 Our circumstances are better than our great-grandfather's,

653
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,060
 but our perspective is worse.

654
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,260
 Have we gotten more satisfied than that generation?

655
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,300
 No, we're more depressed.

656
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,740
 And we're sadder.

657
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,580
 We're more desperate.

658
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,300
 It's the perspective that's off.

659
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,740
 It's not the wrong job.

660
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,000
 It's the wrong perspective.

661
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,440
 We want our job to offer us status and excess.

662
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,300
 And all that strategy is doing

663
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,920
 is leaving us discontent and depressed.

664
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,420
 We want our job to offer us status and excess,

665
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,220
 and it's leaving us discontent and depressed.

666
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:33,580
 And so, you're like, I gotta find a job I love.

667
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,500
 If you were meant to love your job,

668
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,600
 they wouldn't have to pay you to be there.

669
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,420
 I mean, think about it.

670
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,600
 Like, it's really bribery.

671
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,820
 Like, hey, if you'll do this,

672
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,980
 because we know nobody else wants to,

673
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,020
 we will pay you this amount of money in exchange.

674
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,420
 But if it was like a job you love,

675
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,260
 you would do it for free.

676
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,960
 You wouldn't need the money, right?

677
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,820
 But no, it's an agreement.

678
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,540
 Commerce helps the world go round.

679
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,260
 Thirdly, your job is a tool to provide.

680
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,240
 Speaking of money.

681
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,340
 Your job is a tool to provide.

682
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,220
 Provide for who?

683
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,280
 1 Timothy chapter five, verse eight.

684
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,880
 Let me give you four groups of people to provide for.

685
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,400
 Anyone who does not provide for their relatives,

686
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,520
 circle relatives, and especially for their own household

687
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,160
 has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

688
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,280
 Can you think of a worse admonishment in the scriptures?

689
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,960
 If you don't do this, you've denied the faith,

690
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,240
 and you're worse than an unbeliever.

691
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,440
 It's like, wow, that's a little harsh.

692
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,360
 But it was a saying.

693
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,320
 Like, do you think about your siblings' needs as your needs?

694
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,660
 Do you think about your uncle who lost his job

695
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,380
 as your problem?

696
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,820
 All of us are gonna go through

697
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,980
 this weird circle of life thing

698
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,760
 where the people who took care of us,

699
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,700
 we will soon have to take care of.

700
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,520
 And so a part of your work is providing

701
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,680
 for those in your family who have need.

702
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,920
 This is biblical.

703
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,460
 It's very clear in that text.

704
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,080
 Why would God, creator of the heavens and the earth,

705
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,720
 preserve this text so that we might read it tonight?

706
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,960
 Ephesians four, verse 28 says,

707
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,380
 "Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer,

708
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,680
 "but must work, doing something useful with their own hands,

709
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,080
 "that they may have something to share with those in need."

710
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,320
 And so the second people that we provide for

711
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,960
 are for others in need.

712
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,320
 And so when we get a paycheck,

713
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,920
 we're not thinking, hey, what's that thing that I can buy,

714
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,880
 and how can I up my standard of living?

715
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,320
 We're thinking about that that is God,

716
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,640
 sovereign God's provision for you

717
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,360
 to meet the needs of others around you,

718
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,000
 that we literally would go through this life

719
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,080
 with a perspective of,

720
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,240
 I'm trying to find people who have needs that I can help,

721
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,240
 because God allowed me to wake up this morning with health.

722
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,920
 I got out of bed.

723
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,800
 I went to work.

724
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,120
 I got to use an education that I received,

725
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,180
 basically because of where I was born,

726
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,200
 all into his common grace.

727
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,840
 And so how can I share that with others?

728
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
 First Corinthians 16, verse two says,

729
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,140
 "On the first day of every week,

730
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,520
 "each one of you should set aside a sum of money

731
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,560
 "in keeping with your income, saving it up,

732
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,280
 "so that when I come, no collections will have to be made."

733
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,580
 This is repeated through the scriptures.

734
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,920
 Also, second Corinthians eight, verses one through three.

735
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,440
 It's this idea that you work to provide for the mission.

736
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,240
 If you grew up in church, it's called a tithe,

737
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,080
 that you would give to your local body,

738
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,200
 that that's a part of, like you wake up one day,

739
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600
 I get to have these conversations too.

740
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,080
 It's like, oh, I'm an adult now.

741
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,920
 I should tithe.

742
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,100
 Well, actually, since you've been a Christian

743
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,040
 and had a dollar, you should tithe,

744
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,020
 but we should be a part of contributing to the mission.

745
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,180
 Now, we don't take up an offering here.

746
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,200
 I'm not gonna take up an offering tonight,

747
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,700
 but I hope that all of you who follow Jesus

748
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,460
 belong to a church that you contribute to.

749
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,580
 And if you don't contribute here, this is not a guilt trip.

750
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,420
 I'm just stating the facts.

751
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,120
 I'm not asking you for anything, but know that somebody did,

752
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,300
 that somebody paid for the chair that you're sitting in,

753
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,820
 the camera that is broadcasting me, these TVs up here,

754
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,860
 the facility in general.

755
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,900
 It's all been paid for by people

756
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,220
 who provided for the mission.

757
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,660
 We come in here and we get to take advantage of it,

758
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,180
 and sadly, sometimes take it for granted

759
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,940
 that somebody worked hard to provide for the mission.

760
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,900
 And then lastly, 2 Thessalonians 3,

761
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,620
 verse six and verses 10 through 11, the context is this.

762
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,220
 "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,

763
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,080
 "we command you, brothers and sisters,

764
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,880
 "to keep away from every believer

765
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,380
 "who is idle and disruptive."

766
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,340
 And so there's people who aren't doing anything,

767
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,020
 and not only are they not doing anything,

768
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,500
 they're slowing down productivity

769
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,620
 and the efficiency of others doing things.

770
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,880
 And it says this in verse 10.

771
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,100
 "For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule.

772
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,900
 "The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat."

773
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,940
 We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive.

774
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,900
 They are not busy, they are busy bodies.

775
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,820
 You gotta love that.

776
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,380
 They're not doing anything, they're just talking

777
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,480
 to people who are trying to do stuff.

778
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,580
 They're gossips, they're busy bodies.

779
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,820
 They're not doing anything.

780
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,540
 The person who does not work should not eat,

781
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,220
 so we work to provide for ourselves.

782
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,180
 But let me bring something clear

783
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,700
 and square to your attention.

784
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,180
 The Scripture's talking about the provision

785
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,860
 of food, shelter, and clothing.

786
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,340
 Right, this comes from 1 Timothy 6.

787
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,500
 "Whoever has food, shelter, and clothing,

788
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,180
 "we should be content with these."

789
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,740
 Now, right about now, I'm just gonna pause.

790
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,420
 Let me just pause, let's recollect.

791
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,100
 'Cause right about now, you're overwhelmed.

792
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,340
 It sounds like we're talking about boiling the ocean.

793
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,740
 These goals are so lofty, you're starting to realize,

794
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,900
 it's like, wow, if this is true,

795
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,180
 I've been doing this all wrong.

796
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,940
 It's so far from where I'm at right now.

797
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,780
 That's okay.

798
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,180
 That's okay, man.

799
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,380
 There's a reset button on life.

800
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,580
 You say a prayer, you say, God, I missed it.

801
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,460
 I wanna have a right perspective of work.

802
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,600
 I wanna love a job that I've hated now.

803
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,860
 I wanna use the gifts and the talents

804
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,720
 that you've entrusted to me to bring glory to you.

805
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,940
 Now, what this verse is talking about

806
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,780
 is it's not talking about having a newer iPhone

807
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,540
 or a better place to live, a new apartment.

808
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,780
 It's saying you work to provide for yourself

809
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,460
 and consider what is the excess.

810
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,520
 'Cause you might be using the excess for luxuries.

811
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,180
 And so consider what is the excess.

812
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,220
 It's 1 Timothy 6, 8, if you wanna write that down.

813
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,560
 "We should be content with food, clothing,

814
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,400
 "and shelter," is implied.

815
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,900
 And so when I buy something,

816
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,220
 my wife and I, we run $500 purchases through our community.

817
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,040
 We don't buy those without everybody nodding their head,

818
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,640
 saying, hey, this is a good use.

819
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,060
 And when I buy something, there's a number that I track.

820
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,220
 It's 21,000 today.

821
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,180
 I look it up often.

822
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,940
 It's 21,000 is the number of people

823
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,380
 who died today because of hunger.

824
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,160
 And I realized that when I consciously choose

825
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,820
 to have a luxury, I'm consciously choosing

826
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,860
 not to care for that number, not to think about it.

827
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,480
 And so in the spirit of talking about revolution

828
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,420
 and changing the world,

829
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,500
 I'm inviting you into that process with me,

830
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,020
 that you would now be aware of that number.

831
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,200
 21,000 people are not alive right now,

832
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,460
 but they were alive this morning.

833
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,260
 And it's because they didn't have

834
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,700
 the things that we take for granted every day.

835
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,060
 And so we cannot lose sight of our mission.

836
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,780
 What I'm trying to tell you in the spirit of worldview

837
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,760
 is we don't just work to make money to survive.

838
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,340
 The work itself is an aspect of surviving.

839
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,020
 To say it differently, the work itself is living.

840
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:55,220
 Like we work as an aspect of living

841
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,660
 to the glory of God is to work.

842
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,020
 You're gonna be hard-pressed finding retirement in here.

843
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,780
 You're gonna be really challenged finding

844
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,100
 that what you have completely embraced

845
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,280
 is culturally acceptable in the scripture,

846
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,820
 that as long as man is able, he works.

847
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,340
 Lastly, your job is a tool to promote.

848
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,120
 Your job is a tool to promote the gospel specifically.

849
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,140
 One of my favorite verses in all of the scriptures,

850
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,980
 write it down, I hope you memorize it.

851
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,760
 It's Titus chapter two, verses nine and 10.

852
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,180
 Teach slaves, teach employees to be subject

853
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,500
 to their employers in everything,

854
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,860
 to try to please them not to talk back to them.

855
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,140
 Again, I just wanna reiterate

856
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,660
 in case you have this eye roll moment,

857
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,020
 like, yeah, that's not really what that verse is saying.

858
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,020
 It is why it is in the Bible.

859
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,540
 This applies to us.

860
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:55,140
 To try and please them not to talk back to them

861
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,500
 and not to steal from them.

862
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,540
 You're like, steal from them?

863
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,180
 I don't steal, I wouldn't steal.

864
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,020
 I'm a Christian.

865
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,380
 Consider that, like the time you spend on social media.

866
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,580
 Like, unless your boss comes to you and is like,

867
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,540
 hey, here's what I want you to do, here's the goal.

868
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,720
 You know, get on Facebook every day

869
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,700
 for at least 15, 20 minutes.

870
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,520
 That's gonna be a big win.

871
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,060
 Like, let's agree that if that's not the stated goal,

872
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,540
 we can put that in the category of stealing, okay?

873
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,380
 All right.

874
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,380
 And not to steal from them,

875
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,040
 but to show that they can be fully trusted.

876
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,260
 So that in every way,

877
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,200
 they will make the teaching about God, our savior,

878
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,040
 attractive.

879
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,820
 That the reason that we work is to make God attractive.

880
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,660
 And like, so often we want to leave a job

881
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,100
 and we have claimed to be Christ followers

882
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,760
 and we are not making Jesus attractive.

883
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,260
 It's like Goodriddens and other Christians out of here

884
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,180
 because they didn't work hard anyways.

885
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,240
 And then what you're left with

886
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,060
 is all these capitalistic jerks that don't know Jesus,

887
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,000
 but they work really, really hard.

888
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,620
 And that should not be.

889
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,720
 There's something really, really broken with that.

890
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,460
 I come, if we know each other at all,

891
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,300
 I come from the corporate world, corporate America,

892
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,380
 and worked in telecom for five years

893
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,780
 and was an account manager,

894
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,660
 had weekly funnel reviews,

895
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,520
 was on a sales team and had a boss.

896
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,700
 And there was another guy,

897
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,600
 I was a new Christian, so different season of life,

898
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,740
 but there were two Christians on the team.

899
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,020
 One guy was this kind of outspoken evangelist,

900
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,420
 always talk about Jesus, had an Icthus on his car,

901
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,820
 you know, that's the little fish thing.

902
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,380
 And just constantly, you know, talking about God,

903
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,180
 Bible right there on the desk.

904
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,020
 And he just wasn't very good at sales.

905
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,380
 And so every week my wall,

906
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,220
 the wall to my office and my boss's office,

907
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,500
 we shared a wall and we would have funnel reviews.

908
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,640
 That's where you kind of go over,

909
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,060
 hey, what's going to close, what's not,

910
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,980
 and how are you going to hit quota and whatnot.

911
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,920
 And my boss would ask him, hey, what's your strategy?

912
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,800
 And every week I'd hear him say,

913
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,620
 well, I don't know, man, my strategy is hope, you know?

914
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,500
 And good Sunday school answer.

915
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,720
 And so one day my boss just lost it with him

916
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,280
 because he was not performing.

917
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,280
 And he's just like, hope is not a strategy.

918
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,420
 And I was like, he's kind of right, it's not.

919
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,180
 And it sounds really good.

920
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,400
 Like if you're talking in church, like,

921
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,200
 hey, we believe in God, he's going to do it.

922
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,480
 But here's the deal, this guy was lazy

923
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,360
 and he wasn't making the teachings

924
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,680
 of Jesus Christ attractive.

925
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,860
 And there was another guy on our team

926
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,600
 who wasn't an outspoken evangelist,

927
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,980
 but he was a very diligent worker.

928
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,460
 Like he did everything that was asked of him.

929
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,520
 He went above and beyond.

930
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,320
 Everybody else on the team respected him.

931
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,800
 And that boss came up on a hard time.

932
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,040
 His dad got sick.

933
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,320
 And I watched who he reached out to.

934
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,000
 He reached out to a Christian,

935
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,320
 but it wasn't the outspoken, overzealous,

936
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,800
 underperforming Christian.

937
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,600
 It was the diligent Christian who worked hard.

938
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,760
 And that Christian shared the gospel with him.

939
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,560
 I believe he became a Christian.

940
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,840
 I believe he trusted Christ.

941
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,160
 Not because somebody was an evangelist,

942
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,100
 but because of his hard work.

943
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,360
 That's a picture of this Titus 2.10.

944
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,700
 That's the dichotomy.

945
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,120
 That's what you live and exist in.

946
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,240
 And so, so often I'll talk to people

947
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,620
 and they're like, man, I'm just being held back

948
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,120
 because of my faith and being oppressed

949
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,800
 and persecuted and, man, I should've got that promotion,

950
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,660
 but I didn't because I'm a Christian.

951
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:30,440
 I don't buy it.

952
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,960
 Most of the time.

953
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,240
 And so maybe, I mean, maybe that's the case.

954
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,520
 But in capitalistic America,

955
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,320
 I mean, your boss would have to be about not making money.

956
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,160
 You know, to do that.

957
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,640
 They would have to be, well, there's one person

958
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,280
 that would make me a lot of money if I promoted him,

959
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,440
 but they like Jesus.

960
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,120
 So I'm gonna hold them down

961
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,400
 and I'm just gonna be a little more poor

962
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,880
 because I hate Jesus that much.

963
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,160
 I guess that's possible,

964
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,760
 but just consider what else might be going on there.

965
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,960
 You might have a blind spot

966
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,560
 and there might be people around you who don't love Jesus,

967
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,160
 but they're working a lot harder than you are

968
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,120
 and they're getting better

969
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,400
 and they're pushing through the difficulties.

970
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,680
 And so maybe you don't have to email me

971
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,600
 why your case is unique and you really were persecuted.

972
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,240
 I believe you, you know, regardless of what I just said,

973
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,080
 I believe you.

974
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,560
 (congregation laughing)

975
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,160
 And so we work to promote the gospel.

976
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,540
 Just consider how profound this is.

977
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,600
 Like the gospel's always moved forward on work.

978
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,480
 It's always advanced on commerce.

979
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,360
 Like that's how the gospel has spread

980
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,560
 from one nation to another, to another, to another.

981
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,960
 The road that the gospel has traveled on is commerce,

982
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,240
 it's work, it's careers, it's occupations,

983
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,520
 it's professionalism.

984
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,800
 That's how the gospel's moved forward.

985
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
 Let me explain it.

986
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
 Let me explain what I mean.

987
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,280
 If I wanna share Jesus,

988
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,320
 let's say I wanna go to Saudi Arabia to talk about Jesus.

989
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,920
 And so I'm gonna go and try to get a visa

990
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,760
 or I go to the airport and the customs,

991
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,800
 they're gonna say, "Why are you coming?"

992
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,000
 I'm like, "'Cause I wanna talk about Jesus."

993
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,240
 They're gonna be like, "No, you're not."

994
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,000
 I'm not going to Saudi Arabia.

995
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,800
 They're not gonna let me in.

996
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,760
 I can't get in there to talk about Jesus.

997
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,800
 But if I go to Saudi Arabia today

998
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,080
 because I wanna buy oil

999
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,920
 or I've got some tool that's gonna help them

1000
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,480
 mine minerals more efficiently,

1001
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,520
 or I've got a plan to talk about

1002
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,320
 how they can make money there,

1003
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,920
 like they're gonna welcome me with open arms.

1004
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,980
 And while I'm there and being excellent

1005
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,360
 at what God has made me to do,

1006
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,620
 I can talk about Jesus.

1007
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:37,360
 And you know what happens when you help people,

1008
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,720
 using your skills to help people?

1009
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,600
 They wanna listen to you.

1010
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,720
 They lean in, "Tell me more about this Jesus."

1011
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,480
 You know, that's the way that it works.

1012
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,560
 The gospel has always moved on commerce.

1013
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,000
 Work hard so that you make the teachings of Jesus attractive.

1014
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,400
 Let me go one more with you.

1015
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,760
 When I was in corporate America,

1016
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,480
 I worked on the eighth floor of AT&T.

1017
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,020
 To get to my desk,

1018
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,960
 I had to walk through two security checkpoints.

1019
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,800
 You have a security badge,

1020
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,120
 you know that one that kind of stretches out

1021
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,940
 and comes back, has my picture on it right there.

1022
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,120
 Had to put it on my belt every day.

1023
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,480
 Like if I forgot that, you had to go home and get it.

1024
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,720
 Like there's no, I can't get in without it, right?

1025
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,200
 And so every day, through those two security checkpoints,

1026
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,080
 to get to my desk, to sit at my desk,

1027
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,140
 I can't go there today, guys.

1028
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,640
 I can't, I'm not allowed.

1029
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,240
 I could go to Saudi Arabia today

1030
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,240
 easier than I could the eighth floor of AT&T.

1031
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,280
 I was there every single day of my life,

1032
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,620
 but today, no matter how bad I want to,

1033
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,240
 no matter how hard I try,

1034
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,800
 I'm not getting to the eighth floor of AT&T,

1035
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,440
 but that's where I was, that was my mission field.

1036
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,600
 That's where God had me.

1037
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,640
 Where does God have you?

1038
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,760
 'Cause I can't get there in that classroom

1039
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,880
 or that public school.

1040
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,600
 I can't get there behind the counter of the bank.

1041
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,920
 They'll shoot me or arrest me or something.

1042
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,920
 I can't get there behind the counter of that coffee shop

1043
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,280
 or wherever it is that you were today,

1044
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,920
 that grocery store, whatever you do every day.

1045
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,040
 I can't go there, but you're there.

1046
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,420
 God has you there.

1047
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,640
 The gospel moves forward on business, on work.

1048
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,160
 God made us intrinsically to work.

1049
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,740
 That's how it moves.

1050
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,820
 That's how Christ has become famous in the world.

1051
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,880
 And so in summary,

1052
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,020
 your work is a tool to praise.

1053
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,300
 Your job is a tool to prune.

1054
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,280
 Your job is a tool to provide.

1055
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,500
 And your job is a tool to promote.

1056
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,040
 It was work, and I changed it to job.

1057
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,140
 I spoke this morning with one of the leading worldview

1058
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,140
 teachers on the planet, and I was talking to him

1059
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,200
 about this message in biblical worldview.

1060
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,040
 He was just like, "You can't say work is a tool.

1061
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,900
 "Work's not a tool.

1062
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,420
 "Like work is the essence of who we are

1063
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,200
 "as being made in the image of God.

1064
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,400
 "Your job, that's a tool.

1065
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,760
 "Work is not a tool.

1066
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,520
 "Work is who we are.

1067
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,260
 "It's a part of our identity

1068
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,520
 "wrapped up in the image of God."

1069
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,320
 And so this, what I want you to do is,

1070
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,800
 the best way for me to explain to you

1071
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,840
 what a biblical worldview,

1072
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,040
 'cause that's so important in understanding

1073
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,920
 how to put this message,

1074
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,920
 how to fit this message in your life.

1075
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,400
 The biblical worldview is,

1076
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,000
 is like, so like let's just say you're like,

1077
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,020
 "Man, I wanna have two kids one day.

1078
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,860
 "I want two kids.

1079
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,880
 "I hope it's a boy, I hope it's a girl."

1080
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,200
 Like you ever had these conversations?

1081
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,920
 Usually long before you should

1082
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,680
 with somebody you're dating in high school or something.

1083
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,560
 It's like, "Yeah, I'm gonna name him Tyler

1084
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,320
 "and her Jennifer is gonna be."

1085
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,620
 Anyways, just me?

1086
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,460
 Okay.

1087
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,440
 And so you have these,

1088
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,840
 but a biblical worldview starts with this.

1089
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,480
 God, how many kids should I have?

1090
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,080
 'Cause like if this book says 15,

1091
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,360
 then I guess I'm gonna be on a sitcom or something.

1092
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,760
 Just the 16 of us, I don't know, right?

1093
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,560
 17 of us.

1094
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,120
 You ask like, "Hey, when should I date?

1095
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,960
 "When should I get married?

1096
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
 "Why I wanna get married when I'm this age?"

1097
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,560
 Wait, how old is this thing?

1098
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,960
 Because if like there's a God,

1099
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,680
 he created everything and he has a plan

1100
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,680
 and he's spoken to it.

1101
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,240
 Like I've gotta start with the Bible.

1102
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,280
 And so when you're like, you know,

1103
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,200
 should I get a new job?

1104
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,040
 Should I move?

1105
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,860
 Should I change jobs?

1106
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,700
 Should I do this?

1107
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,760
 Like, well, hold on.

1108
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,600
 What does this say?

1109
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,440
 That's a biblical worldview.

1110
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,280
 It's a lens.

1111
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,100
 Let me just,

1112
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,140
 I can't see without these.

1113
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,080
 Like without them, I just see

1114
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,360
 kind of blur colors.

1115
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,320
 I can't see without my glasses.

1116
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,960
 And everything's in focus.

1117
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,140
 And so if I didn't have glasses,

1118
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,480
 I would go through the world.

1119
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,320
 And if no one ever,

1120
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,500
 if I didn't even know of the concept of glasses,

1121
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,720
 I would just think this is what the world looks like.

1122
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,640
 But right now I'm in a danger of falling off this stage

1123
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,980
 'cause I can't see.

1124
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,320
 And so what happens when I put these on,

1125
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,640
 I look like Napoleon Dinaite.

1126
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,480
 No, no, that's not what happens.

1127
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,440
 (congregation laughing)

1128
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,040
 When I put these on,

1129
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,760
 everything comes into focus.

1130
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,600
 Stay with me.

1131
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,680
 Everything comes into focus.

1132
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,600
 And I begin to see things as it should be seen.

1133
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,480
 I see you've got a checkered shirt on there.

1134
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,560
 Or gingham, I guess they call it.

1135
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,020
 I see your white hat.

1136
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,160
 I didn't while ago, it's just a blur.

1137
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,760
 I see you back there in the red.

1138
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,140
 And I see you up there in the blue.

1139
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,980
 I see that.

1140
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,060
 I see things as it was meant to be seen

1141
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,160
 in the focus of the way that it's intended to be.

1142
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,040
 That's a biblical worldview.

1143
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,520
 The essence of seeing your work

1144
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,100
 as a part of who you are,

1145
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,600
 the aspect that you work,

1146
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,460
 and that it's an act of worship

1147
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,920
 to the one who created you in his image

1148
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,040
 as one who works,

1149
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,440
 that's a biblical lens.

1150
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,440
 It changes the conversations that you have at your work.

1151
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,240
 That you were created by a God who loves you,

1152
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,600
 but in the fall, everything was lost.

1153
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,560
 And the work was not cursed,

1154
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,520
 but the ground you work was cursed.

1155
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,800
 It fights against you and produces thorns and thistles.

1156
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,680
 And all of a sudden drudgery enters the picture.

1157
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,660
 And that as a follower of Jesus Christ,

1158
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,160
 knowing the one true God,

1159
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,680
 that you're gonna be with him forever and ever and ever.

1160
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,760
 Your job now with a biblical worldview

1161
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,280
 is to present commercials of that place.

1162
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,600
 That you would show people glimpses of heaven

1163
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,040
 by the things that you produce through your toil.

1164
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,920
 That they would say,

1165
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,720
 "Oh, that's what heaven's gonna be like."

1166
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,260
 And the way that you produce that with joy.

1167
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,940
 That you didn't see it as just taking mortgage applications.

1168
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,040
 You saw it as providing someone a home and a new life.

1169
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,320
 And you don't see it as just creating a lesson plan.

1170
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,720
 You see it as discipleship of a classroom of 32.

1171
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,640
 You don't see it as just serving a mocha frappuccino.

1172
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,320
 You see it as an interaction with another human being

1173
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,080
 and an opportunity to show them how they can live forever.

1174
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,400
 That changes everything.

1175
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,300
 You're redeemers.

1176
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,880
 You're putting the world back together

1177
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,720
 in the image of God.

1178
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,280
 You're image bearers.

1179
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,140
 You are picking up the broken pieces.

1180
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,680
 And when you go through life and you think,

1181
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,560
 "I just wanna make more money so I can buy more stuff."

1182
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,520
 You're under the influence of Satan.

1183
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,760
 You are under the influence of the prince of this air.

1184
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,600
 You are buying into a satanic message.

1185
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,280
 And you're missing out on your purpose.

1186
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,680
 And you're going to die having missed your purpose.

1187
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,140
 Can you think of a greater tragedy?

1188
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,840
 And you're not gonna be happier.

1189
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,000
 Statistically, what else do we need to know?

1190
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,440
 It's not making anybody happier.

1191
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,500
 I pray you live out your purpose, man.

1192
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,040
 You live out your calling.

1193
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,000
 Not trying to find this nuanced, very narrow path

1194
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,560
 for yourself to walk, but to in the grind worship God

1195
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,760
 and become great at something.

1196
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,640
 Maybe something different that you never would have said,

1197
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,000
 "I wanna be great at that."

1198
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,040
 But that you'd be an example to make the teaching

1199
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,520
 of Christ, your Savior, attractive.

1200
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,960
 Father, would you help us in that?

1201
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,500
 You tell us in Colossians 3.

1202
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,700
 That whatever we do, whether in word or deed,

1203
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,920
 that we're to do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus,

1204
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,960
 giving thanks to you through him.

1205
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,680
 And so would you help us do that?

1206
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,000
 Whatever we do in word or deed,

1207
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,260
 that we do it in your name for your glory.

1208
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:58,240
 That we would avodah you in our work and in our toil,

1209
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,040
 in our labor, in our worship, in our service.

1210
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,400
 Father, would you take the things that I said

1211
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,840
 that are inconsistent with your word,

1212
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,120
 and before they get up to worship you, Lord,

1213
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,320
 would you allow them to forget it?

1214
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,040
 The things that I said that was me and modern wisdom

1215
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,960
 and just the ideas of man,

1216
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,680
 that they forget it before they stand up.

1217
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,040
 But the things that I said that are consistent

1218
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,000
 with your Holy Spirit and your word

1219
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,700
 and your desires for their life,

1220
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,500
 would you please, God, not let them shake them,

1221
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,360
 not let them forget them.

1222
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,680
 Grab them with their hearts and the soul of a human being

1223
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,860
 and allow their lives to be transformed,

1224
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,800
 that we would no longer conform

1225
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,000
 to the patterns of this world,

1226
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,680
 but be transformed by the renewing of our minds

1227
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,320
 so that we might be able to test

1228
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,840
 and to prove what your will is,

1229
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,440
 your good, pleasing and perfect will.

1230
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,440
 Not where should I work, but tomorrow, how should I work?

1231
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,240
 And when they show up, allow them to put on the lens

1232
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,040
 of a biblical worldview and to do so with excellence.

1233
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,340
 In Christ's name, amen.
