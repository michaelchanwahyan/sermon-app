[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.320]   - Alright, hey we're wrapping up our series,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.740]   Cupid, Dating Myths, taking one myth per week
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.840]   and just kind of addressing that from the scriptures.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.460]   Trying to see what God, the creator,
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.840]   the heavens, the earth, what truths he has for us.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.340]   And there's just this reality that I think a lot of us,
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.360]   as we think through our expectations
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.680]   or just this idea of love or we look at culture,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.500]   you know, it really throws us off.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.120]   And so we're kind of scrambling with resources
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.220]   and you get this book and like let's be honest,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.780]   it doesn't, if this whole book,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.140]   and you know it's a bunch of pages,
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.960]   you know everything that it has to say about marriage
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.760]   is probably less than that, okay?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.360]   And so then you know, we kind of resort to,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.100]   okay well where else can I learn, you know,
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.120]   Us Weekly or what, you know, Cosmo,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.000]   where else are there truths?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.220]   And I think a lot of times we turn to, you know,
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.920]   Hollywood or the romantic comedies that are put out there
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.680]   and I just, I wish somebody would show an honest movie,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.460]   right, say hey this is honest, like this is real,
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.400]   this is what love actually looks like.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880]   In fact, before we go any further,
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.440]   I want you guys to watch this.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.880]   That movie is fantasy.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.160]   And here's why it's fantasy,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.320]   'cause I don't know if you've seen it,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.260]   I'm gonna ruin the ending so if you care, earmuffs.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.580]   But you know, essentially the lady has Alzheimer's
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.040]   and it ends in this beautiful picture of commitment.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.140]   But you don't get commitment in the way that
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.360]   traveling the path the movie takes you down, okay?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440]   People who travel that path don't end up in commitment,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.300]   they end up somewhere different, that's fantasy.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.980]   Now I think a lot of us, we're here tonight
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.060]   and the reality is I prayed through
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.380]   where the Lord would take us to tonight
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.660]   as we wrap up this series,
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.820]   I think a lot of us are hoping in fantasy.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.020]   And I know fantasy, see I got two little girls,
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.700]   two little girls, right, and you walk into my house
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.580]   and it looks like Disney threw up in my room,
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.180]   like it exploded in my house, okay?
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.740]   Everything is Disney princess.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.980]   Like I walk in and Presley who's five,
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.980]   she's the daddy, Finley's usually the mommy,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.860]   poor baby Weston is always the baby
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.220]   and they're always taking care,
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.700]   they're always playing house,
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.180]   they're always dressing up like princesses,
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.460]   put on their little crowns,
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.580]   and I mean they have proposed to me 17 times
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.740]   and it's sweet, you know, daddy will you marry me?
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.540]   Yes baby, I'm married to mom.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.740]   You know they proposed to Weston 17 times as well.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.820]   And so just all of these things,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.500]   in fact we went to the movies on Sunday
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.220]   and Finley's like, hey daddy can I wear my crown?
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.260]   I'm like sure, you know, come on princess,
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.060]   wear your crown, so she wears her crown to the movies
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.540]   and after we go to Starbucks and this lady's like,
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.100]   oh man, you look so beautiful,
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.700]   you know dressed up like a princess,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.740]   did you go to a ball today?
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.060]   I'm like no, we went to the movies, you know,
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.100]   and so that's their world, right?
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.180]   And so for some of you, that's where it started.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.900]   It started with Disney, Happily Ever After,
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.940]   and you've been pursuing that ever since
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.180]   and that's what your crosshairs are on,
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.420]   that's what you're looking for,
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.780]   that's where your expectations are,
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.060]   but the problem is,
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.220]   the problem is your greatest disappointments
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.660]   come from your expectations
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.500]   and that's why so many people,
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   as they consider dating and marriage and relationships,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   it is riddled with disappointments,
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.660]   discouragement and despair
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.700]   and I think everybody's looking for something to hope in,
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.820]   but too many of us are hoping in fantasy
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.500]   and so today the myth is just this idea
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.740]   that marriage is for happiness.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.660]   It's a really popular idea that you marry
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.180]   to be happy, that marriage is for happiness.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.140]   Monica and I, I know this firsthand,
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.780]   because my wife and I, we pursued fantasy.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.340]   Like we wanted the happily ever after story
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.580]   and I even think like for so much of our relationship,
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.660]   we actually enjoyed living in the soap opera,
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.660]   so I remember the day that she walked in,
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.660]   I was at this party in college, you know,
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.980]   in this tiny little apartment,
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.460]   'cause somehow you have big parties
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.780]   and tiny little apartments in college,
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.820]   and she walked in wearing this leopard dress
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.060]   and I looked up and I was just like,
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.340]   oh my goodness, who is that?
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.460]   And I was in a committed relationship
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.980]   and she was in a committed relationship,
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.900]   but that didn't stop us and we started pursuing each other
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.220]   and somehow, you know, somehow we ended up
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.540]   in this relationship where we kept pursuing each other
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.300]   and it looked like, and I'm gonna give you a glimpse
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.220]   into it, it looked like manic highs and manic lows.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.620]   It looked like I love you, I adore you,
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.980]   we're star-crossed lovers, blah,
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.980]   and then I hate you, I never wanna see you again,
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.500]   get out of my face, I can't live without you,
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.580]   walk home, you know, these are the things.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.740]   Some of you are like, yeah.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.660]   That's, I mean, those are everything I just said
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.060]   or things I had said then, dozens and dozens
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.580]   and dozens of times.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.940]   And then this incredible thing happened
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.980]   where we became followers of Jesus
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.700]   in the midst of all of that turmoil,
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.500]   we found someone else to love besides each other.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.820]   In fact, I remember as we went through pre-marital
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.620]   counseling, sitting with this little pastor,
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.180]   very skeptical, and he looked at me
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.180]   and he just said, hey, I want you guys
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.620]   to stop pursuing each other and start pursuing God together.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.300]   And I just thought, you are so stupid.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.420]   Like, what does that even mean?
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.700]   Like, okay, we're gonna start pursuing each other,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.100]   we're getting married, dude.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.860]   And as I look back on the work that God has done
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.740]   in our relationship today, and that's exactly what happened,
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.380]   when it turned around, we had stopped pursuing each other
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.500]   and we started pursuing him together
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.020]   and things started straightening out,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.100]   not before we got married, okay?
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.540]   Year one, honeymoon, year two, disaster.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.100]   Disaster.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.700]   And so some of us, you know, we never grow out of this
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.540]   pursuit of happily ever after,
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.460]   this pursuit of someone to love.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.700]   You know, and I told you, the Bible doesn't have
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.620]   a lot to say about it, but what it does have to say,
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.420]   it says marriage is hard, it gives instructions
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.100]   because it's difficult, and then it says
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.020]   it's actually about something beyond each other.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.140]   It says that marriage is actually this metaphor
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.180]   for us learning more about God
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.180]   as we look on what marriage looks like.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.780]   That's really what the Bible has to say
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.340]   about marriage in a nutshell.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.220]   And so I just wanna, let me recap where we've been
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.220]   in Cupid series, the first thing, week one,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.580]   we talked about resetting our sights,
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.940]   we talked about the criteria,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.860]   setting our sights on godly character,
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.260]   and I just said this idea, hey, you don't need
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.580]   a trophy wife or a husband, you need someone
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.980]   to go to war with, okay, marriage is hard,
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.940]   discipling your children, that's difficult,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.860]   life's gonna throw all these curveballs at you,
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.460]   you don't know what's coming, you don't want
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.460]   a trophy wife or husband, you want someone
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.620]   you can go to war with.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.700]   Week two, we talked about how we're resetting our strategy,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.780]   I just said, hey, don't follow your heart,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.380]   inform your heart, we looked at Proverbs 4:23,
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.060]   said, hey, tell your heart where to go
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.220]   and what to look for, don't do this baggage swap
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.380]   where you meet with someone and you say,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.700]   hey, you take some of my baggage,
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.980]   I'll take some of your baggage,
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.900]   but actually leave someone better than you find them
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.060]   as you date them, as you spend time with them.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.020]   If you do break up, if it doesn't end in marriage,
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.580]   then make them better for someone else, right?
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.220]   Hopefully the time that y'all spend together,
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.020]   you grow more godly together, that's what it looks like
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.220]   as two Christians would spend time together.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.540]   And then week three, we talked about
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.100]   resetting our commitment.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.860]   This idea that sex is a powerful gift,
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.540]   but outside of the context of marriage, it's destructive.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.700]   That you can have sex outside of marriage,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.820]   but then all of a sudden, you can't have that kind of sex
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.980]   inside of marriage, and I see that over and over and over,
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.320]   and we talked about how this crazy idea
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.580]   that the world says is insane,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.320]   we talked about how purity is possible,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.460]   and that there's people doing it,
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.060]   that if that's you, that you're not a weirdo,
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.620]   that it's God-ordained, it's absolutely possible.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.620]   Well, tonight I wanna talk about resetting our expectations,
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.860]   how you and I, how we respond,
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.900]   or should respond when our expectations aren't met.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.500]   And so we're gonna talk about
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.860]   dealing with disappointments in dating,
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.820]   dealing with despair in dating, and dealing with divorce.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.660]   And before you leave, I hope I can give you a glimpse
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.060]   of what it looks like to doing it right,
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.100]   and I hope you'll stay in there with me 'til the end, okay?
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.540]   I think there'll be temptation.
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.940]   If you hear something that rubs you the wrong way,
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.060]   you'll walk out, and I hope you'll hang in there with me,
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.340]   so that we can really see what God has to say in this.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.900]   Let me start in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.400]   It's the chapter in your Bible on love, okay?
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.100]   And so in verse four, it just says this.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.540]   Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.020]   it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude,
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.060]   it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.340]   it keeps no record of wrongs, love does not delight in evil,
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.820]   but rejoices with the truth, it always protects,
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.060]   always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres,
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.860]   and it's a really high bar.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.580]   It's like, well, how am I supposed to do that?
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.940]   Keep no records of wrongs, always persevere, always trust?
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.940]   How am I supposed to always trust?
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.460]   And then he says this.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.100]   When I was a child, verse 11, when I was a child,
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.940]   I talked like a child, I thought like a child,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.380]   I reasoned like a child, but when I became a man,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.460]   I put childish ways behind me.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.460]   When I grew up, I stopped with the childish fantasies.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.600]   I put Disney away, and I started pursuing something else
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.260]   to inform what it would mean to love.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.220]   Greater love has no one than this,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.740]   that he would die for us.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.700]   That Christ would die for us.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:09.700]   Last night, my little girl, my four-year-old,
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.840]   love her, she says the craziest things, she's so funny,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.380]   and I'm tucking her into bed, and we're reading a story,
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.500]   and she's just out of nowhere.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.700]   The way that we handled the Santa Claus thing
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.060]   is we just told them, hey, there's a secret about Santa,
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.060]   'cause we want them to trust us,
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.900]   you know, we don't ever wanna lie,
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.180]   and we want them to be able to have fun,
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.920]   and so just as we celebrate Santa, and do it big,
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.780]   and leave him milk and cookies,
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.020]   I just always tell them, hey, remember,
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.220]   there's a secret about Santa, one day you're gonna know,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.500]   and I'm telling you right now, there's a secret about Santa.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.540]   Last night, I'm reading her the Bible story,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.380]   and out of nowhere, she goes,
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.780]   "Daddy, what's the secret about Santa?"
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.500]   And I'm like, baby girl, I can't tell you.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.260]   And I tuck her in, I go in the living room,
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.260]   and I'm writing, and I just hear her wailing in there.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.780]   You know, like, just, I'm talking, crying, like,
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.220]   (panting)
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.620]   just like, crying hysterically in there.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.700]   And, you know, and I'm listening, and she goes,
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   "You hurt my feelings, you hurt my feelings."
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.340]   And so I go in, and I'm like, Finley Bear, what's wrong?
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.340]   And she's like, "You won't tell me the secret about Santa."
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.780]   I'm like, baby girl, listen, there's a secret,
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.020]   I'm telling you there's a secret, I want you to find out.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.980]   And she's like, "Well, I just wanna know."
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.380]   And she's so disappointed that I won't tell her this thing,
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.900]   this, you know, this little joke.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.340]   Santa's not real, by the way.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:35.340]   Somebody's crying back.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.500]   Sorry.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.020]   Here's the deal.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.940]   It's funny when you're three, or four, she's four.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.100]   It's funny when you're four.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.260]   You know, she hasn't learned how to
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.540]   deal with disappointment.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.380]   But some of us, man, we're 24, maybe 34.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.420]   He doesn't love me.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.020]   It's not so funny, though.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.020]   You know, it's less funny.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.780]   And the scripture says, hey, when are we gonna stop
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.580]   fantasizing about this thing, that there's gonna be
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.780]   this Prince Charming that's gonna swoop in,
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.380]   we're gonna leave, I know you wanna believe
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.260]   that that hope is real.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.620]   But I'll tell you that men and women are miserable saviors.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.900]   Miserable saviors.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:30.740]   And so let's just talk about dealing with disappointment.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.620]   What does it look like when our expectations aren't met,
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.460]   dealing with disappointment?
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.860]   Proverbs 16, nine says this, that in his heart,
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.420]   a man plans his course.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.020]   In his heart, a man says, I want that.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.940]   In his heart, a man or a woman says,
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.140]   I want the white picket fence and the suburban home
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.540]   and the German shepherd and the two kids,
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.100]   one boy, one girl.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.180]   But the Lord determines his and her steps.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.540]   And so you may not be where you had hoped,
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.380]   but you must trust that God is at work,
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.180]   that tonight you may have came in here
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.780]   and maybe you thought by now, man, I thought surely
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.180]   by the time I'm 32, I would be married.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.620]   By the time I'm 39, I thought surely that I would be married
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.820]   and so you had these expectations and just as I said earlier
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.700]   your greatest disappointments come from your expectations
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.300]   and if you're not careful, those will turn into despair,
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.900]   those will turn into depression,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.700]   those will turn into darkness.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.260]   And so the question that I have for you tonight right now,
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.700]   just as we look at Proverbs 69 is do you trust
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.540]   that God is good and that God is in control?
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.980]   And you've gotta answer that.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.180]   Do you trust that God is good and God is in control?
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.060]   But as I thought about that, I want you to know,
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.740]   'cause I don't wanna give you bad dating advice,
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.140]   I want you to know there's two kinds of trusting God.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.140]   Okay, there's a passive trusting.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.340]   This is what that looks like.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.860]   It's like when you look around
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.460]   and your circumstances aren't met
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.540]   or you are in a situation of unwanted circumstances,
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.600]   okay, you trust that God is in control of that.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.660]   You stop where you are, you acknowledge,
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.500]   hey God, you are God, I am not God and you are in control.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.180]   You have numbered my days ahead of time
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.820]   and you are on your throne and all power and honor
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.180]   and glory is yours.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.600]   I trust you.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.520]   Okay, and then there's an active trusting.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.180]   This is Proverbs 3, five and six.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.260]   It says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.520]   "and lean not on your own understanding,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.540]   "but in all your ways acknowledge him."
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.160]   In the Hebrew, it's not like acknowledge,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.420]   it's like the trajectory of your life
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.720]   acknowledges that there is a God.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.380]   In all your ways acknowledge him
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.020]   and he will make your path straight.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.120]   He will set your path straight.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.100]   This active trusting is, hey God,
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.660]   I wanna know what you have said is good
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.260]   and I wanna pursue it.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.860]   God, I wanna test the desires of my heart
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.620]   with the instruction that you have given me
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.060]   and then I want to pursue them
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.420]   if they are good and consistent with you.
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.500]   So don't say, 'cause some of you guys are like,
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.900]   well, the reason that I'm not married
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.300]   is because I'm waiting for God to bring me a wife.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.660]   And I'm just telling you,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.060]   like while you're playing World of Warcraft or whatever,
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.300]   like she's not gonna fall through the ceiling
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.920]   onto your lap and a pastor pop up
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.700]   or come down the chimney and say,
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.260]   here we are, let's do this deal.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.980]   Like that's not gonna happen.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.980]   There is a part of this deal
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.380]   where you have to actively pursue her.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.860]   And the scripture says,
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.740]   he who finds a wife finds a good thing.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.940]   So should you want a wife, you should look for a wife.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.900]   Ladies, amen?
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.500]   Okay, okay.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:37.220]   And so I think some of us thought that
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.980]   not just that we'd be married by now,
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.940]   but that we'd be married to a particular person by now.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.740]   Like maybe you hope that he would have
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.740]   bought that ring by now.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.900]   Or maybe you're looking back
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.100]   and wondering what he's doing right now
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.220]   or where he's at or what city he's in right now.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.620]   And so some of us are,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.480]   or when I'm going to meet him right now.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.300]   Where is he, God, have you forgotten me?
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.080]   Have you forsaken me?
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.420]   The scripture says no.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.180]   I think some of us were chasing the one, you know?
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.060]   The one, you guys remember the one?
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.060]   We always talk about that every year,
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.620]   we gotta talk about the one.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.620]   The one is out there on a unicorn in Fantasia somewhere.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.580]   Let me hit you with this.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.780]   And this is gonna blow some of your minds, okay?
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.100]   There is no one.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.160]   There's ones.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.540]   Like there's people that you can choose from,
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.780]   but there's no one.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.200]   And I'll tell you to kind of help you out,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.300]   the pool from which you can date from,
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.040]   it's a relatively small pool, okay?
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.040]   It's those, you know, you look at the world,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.900]   it's full of people who do not follow Jesus.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.620]   And so it's like, you know, a lot of the world,
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.760]   you're like, hey, well, none of them.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.500]   And then you look what's left,
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.800]   and it's like, okay, these are the people
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.380]   who are passionately, with their lives, seeking Christ.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.580]   And so these are the folks that I can choose from.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.820]   You know, not just someone like check the box,
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.300]   like I had this experience around six,
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.460]   but like today, I am currently running after Jesus.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.440]   That you would be that person,
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   and that you would look for that person.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.940]   And so let me hit on this one thing for a second,
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.200]   as I always do.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.520]   People are like, what do you mean there's not a one?
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.700]   Somebody's always mind blown on that.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.700]   And so I just ask like this,
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.780]   was I the one for Monica?
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.360]   And before you shut up, the answer is yes, and here's why.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.020]   Because we went down the aisle together,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.400]   and we sat in front of that pastor,
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.280]   and we made a covenant before God together.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.360]   Do you know the difference between a covenant
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.040]   and a commitment?
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.600]   A commitment is a if-then statement.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.260]   A commitment is if you do this, then I will.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.520]   A commitment, it's an if-then, it's a hey,
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.100]   if you meet your terms, then I'm going to meet my terms,
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.720]   and if you don't meet your terms,
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.080]   then I can do these, I can take this action.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.000]   A covenant is I will, regardless of what you do.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.740]   A covenant is you standing before God,
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.320]   saying hey, I will do this,
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.920]   for better or worse, sickness and health,
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.560]   till death do us part,
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.400]   regardless, if she loses her mind,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.720]   I'll be there.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.800]   All right, so now let me ask you this.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.640]   Is there someone better for Monica?
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.480]   And the answer is a resounding yes.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.560]   Lots of them.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.040]   You get that, mind blown?
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.660]   Stay with me.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.160]   Okay, there are guys out there
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.800]   that love more, I mean, more compatible for her.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.300]   There's guys out there, you know, she's 5'3", I'm 6'7".
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.940]   There's shorter guys.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.480]   There's guys that don't like guns and motorcycles like I do.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.400]   You know, she doesn't love guns and motorcycles.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.600]   There are guys out there, there's hundreds,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.920]   maybe hundreds of thousands of guys
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.200]   that would be better suited for Monica than me.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.960]   Maybe hundreds of thousands of girls
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.840]   that would be better suited for me than Monica.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.980]   But we found each other,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.520]   and we committed to each other.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.040]   Crazy, huh?
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.440]   It's crazy.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.760]   And we committed, so we're doing this thing together, right?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.680]   We're running together.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.520]   There's no one, there's these ones
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.160]   that God has said, "Hey, choose from these people."
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.480]   Even as Abraham sent Eleazar to find a wife for his son,
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.960]   he said, "Hey, go to these select people
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.300]   "and choose someone for him."
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.920]   All right.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.960]   And so you're not waiting to be swept away in some fantasy.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.120]   You're growing more godly.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.640]   These are not these days that we waste.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.000]   You're not lesser of a person
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.120]   because you're a single person.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.160]   In fact, you're the engine of the church
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.880]   as a single person.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   Single people are the most well-resourced,
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.080]   have the most time.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.800]   You are the engine of the church.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.360]   That's why God, that's why Jesus used a bunch
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.960]   of young adults to change the world.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.800]   That's why he did it.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.720]   I believe wholeheartedly.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.260]   You read the scriptures, look at the disciples.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.360]   Between the ages of 18 and 32, Jesus says,
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.680]   "Hey, give me some young adults, I'll change the world."
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.120]   'Cause they were ready and willing.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.480]   It's game time, you're in your prime.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.640]   We've said that before.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.680]   And so what do you need?
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.920]   What do you need to meet the one?
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.800]   It's pretty simple, man.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.720]   You need to be in the same location geographically.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.540]   You have to see each other.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.300]   You need to be in the same location spiritually.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.440]   All right?
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.820]   You need to be in the same location spiritually.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.960]   The scripture says, "Equally yoked."
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.800]   Second Corinthians 6, verse 14.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.240]   Same location spiritually.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.520]   You need to be traveling the same direction.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.200]   Right, hey, we're both running towards God.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.520]   The trajectory of our life is that we believe
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.800]   that there's a God and we're gonna die
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.720]   and we're gonna go be with him.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.400]   And so we use this life for that.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.800]   And then lastly, you know, compatibility, romance,
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.120]   I don't, you know, chemistry.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.720]   I would say you need to be able to ride
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.880]   in the same car together.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.360]   And more, and before you scoff at that,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.200]   let me say this.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.080]   There's gonna be days where you don't want to.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.160]   So before you think that's crazy,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.280]   there's gonna be days where you're like,
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.560]   I would rather ride in the car
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.760]   with any other single breathing person than you.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.240]   And so write that down.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   Say, JP said this, I think he's a liar,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.260]   so that you can come back and say,
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.240]   well, man, I repent.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.240]   So you are becoming something.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.080]   God is at work in you, right?
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.240]   He's at work in you.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.220]   And so I pray that the trajectory of your life
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.640]   would be you pursuing Jesus.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.400]   The reality of it is,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.640]   and it's interesting, I've been hearing this lately,
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.800]   like, people are like, man, I've been doing
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.300]   what you said, it didn't work.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.480]   What does work, like, you mean you didn't get married
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.320]   in two weeks?
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.680]   What does that mean, it didn't work?
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.840]   Well, you know, she said, no,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.220]   that doesn't mean it didn't work.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.060]   Don't you understand, like, this is a refining moment.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.320]   This is God working, it's okay,
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.960]   like a no doesn't mean it didn't work.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.680]   A breakup doesn't mean it didn't work.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.600]   See, the process is not about you getting married,
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.160]   but you growing godly.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   And you can grow godly through a breakup.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.680]   You can grow godly through a no.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.480]   You do that by navigating those waters with honesty.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.760]   By asking questions, hey, help me understand.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.200]   Hey, how could I have loved or cared for you better in this?
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.040]   And you grow more godly, and whatever you're doing,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.360]   if you're doing it His way, it will work.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.160]   People say, well, I'm gonna give Christian dating a shot.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.360]   What does that mean, Christian dating?
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.100]   If you're Christian and you're dating,
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.700]   you're Christian dating, right?
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.920]   I mean, right, I'm just confused by that.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.960]   It's like, Christians would be like,
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.400]   well, I'm gonna give secular dating a shot.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.240]   What does that?
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.920]   No, give pursuing Christ a shot.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   Don't give it a shot, give it your life.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.800]   And then what comes out of that
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.920]   will be out of the overflow of those things.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.240]   See, I think that,
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.320]   I think that God is using our challenges
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.680]   and our disappointments to grow us into His man or woman.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.440]   I've been doing this thing,
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.240]   this vocational ministry thing for six years now,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.800]   and I've met with hundreds and hundreds
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.920]   of hurting married folks.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.020]   And I've realized there are, I've never,
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.160]   I'll just say, I personally,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.720]   I've never met someone with marital problems.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.760]   Every person I've met had single people problems
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.120]   they brought into marriage.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.480]   You tracking with that?
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.720]   Like their marriage problems
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.500]   were problems before they were married,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.000]   and they brought them into marriage,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.840]   and then they didn't know how to work that out
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.120]   with someone else.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.240]   And I think as we work through that conflict,
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.640]   as we grow through that, God is working in our hearts.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.680]   He says this in James,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.280]   "Consider it pure joy, my brothers,
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.080]   "whenever you face trials of many kinds,
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.400]   "because you know that the testing of your faith
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.720]   "develops perseverance,
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.440]   "and perseverance must finish its work
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.080]   "so that you may be mature and complete,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.640]   "not lacking anything."
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.140]   See, your faith is being tested in dating.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.020]   Your faith is getting tested in dating.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.860]   I get asked all the time,
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.620]   "Well, what does it look like if I'm a guy,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.300]   "I know the Scriptures say that I'm supposed to lead,
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.000]   "what does it look like to lead as a guy in a relationship?"
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.200]   Simple, my answer to that is simple.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.880]   You lead in purity.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.080]   See, here's the reality.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.240]   If he can help, if he can guard himself
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.040]   against his greatest urge, right,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.280]   he's probably gonna do all right at keeping the lights on,
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.160]   you know, paying the bills and keeping the kids fed.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.660]   Like, if he can protect himself,
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.320]   if he can be self-controlled or controlled by the Spirit
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.560]   enough to lead you towards purity,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.000]   he's probably gonna be an all right provider,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.480]   and he's probably gonna be faithful to you,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.100]   but likewise, if he can't,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.980]   his faithfulness to you, it's a guess.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.120]   It's a shot in the dark.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.200]   We'll see.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.040]   It's a gamble.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.080]   It's a gamble.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.540]   And so, if you haven't found that guy,
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.640]   if you haven't found that girl, don't be discouraged.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.840]   We talked about how discouragement can lead to despair,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.080]   and so the second thing I wanna cover
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.240]   is just this idea of dealing with despair.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.560]   Dealing with despair.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.120]   See, maybe the person you thought you'd end up with
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   broke your heart.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.720]   Breakups are hard.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.640]   It's an understatement.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.680]   Breakups are difficult.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.480]   And so, let's just talk through that for a second.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.640]   If you're in a breakup or you're going through a breakup,
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.760]   would you do this for me?
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.960]   Would you just be honest?
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.840]   Okay, don't drag God into your breakup.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.040]   Don't drag God into your excuse.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.360]   "Well, I just feel the Lord is, you know,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.600]   "I just think God is just telling me."
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.880]   Just say, "Hey, I'm not feeling this anymore."
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.360]   That's the truth.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.720]   I don't need to over-spiritualize this.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.640]   And maybe we didn't do a great job
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   of guarding our hearts in that.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.800]   I know that's ambiguous and people tend to hate it,
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.160]   this idea of guarding your hearts.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.800]   And so, you may hurt and I may hurt,
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.240]   and the reality of it is we need to go our separate ways.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.560]   I don't know what the truth is, right?
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.960]   It may be like, "I don't like your hair,"
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.480]   but whatever the truth is,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.760]   I'm just saying, "Hey, just use the truth."
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.900]   You don't have to over-spiritualize it.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.280]   You don't have to say something that it's not.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.660]   You don't have to be scared.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.600]   The Lord gave you a spirit of power and love
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.920]   and self-discipline, not a spirit of timidity,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.320]   the scripture says.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.360]   You can sit there and respectfully look somebody
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   in the eyes and say, "Hey, let me just be honest with you.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.800]   "Because I'm a Christian and that's what we do,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.560]   "we're honest.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.320]   "And I don't need to over-spiritualize it.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.160]   "I don't need to make it God's fault."
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.200]   That's like when I spank my girls,
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.120]   I'm like, "Well, God said I have to, you know?"
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.600]   That's not gonna increase their view of God.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.280]   Hey, I know you're really, really hurt right now,
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.480]   but it's God's fault.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.160]   Okay, like I know you wanna blame me for this,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.680]   but the reality of it is it's God's fault.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.040]   No, it's not.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.840]   It's not God's fault.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.680]   Okay.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.520]   And so, let me say this.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.240]   If your brother or sister has sinned against you
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.680]   in that relationship, you go and you tell them, honestly.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.560]   You say, "Hey, you've sinned against me.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.400]   "You have hurt me.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.680]   "I think you've done something
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.480]   "that contradicts the scriptures."
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.800]   But if you're hurt because of their actions,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.760]   like you're hurt is just the product
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.160]   of their feelings drifting.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.040]   Like if you're hurt is the product of their feelings,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.400]   but they haven't sinned against you,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.360]   then it's okay.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.200]   You need to know this.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.080]   It is okay to be hurt, okay?
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.200]   But the reality of it is, is hurt people hurt people,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.880]   and it's not okay to hurt people.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.920]   Okay, so you take a deep breath.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.320]   You know, take a deep breath.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   Call your girlfriends, call your guy friends, respectively,
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   and say, "Hey, here's where I'm at.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.160]   "I'm hurting, and I wanna hurt someone.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.480]   "I wanna call him right now,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.200]   "after a shot of tequila at 2 a.m."
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.600]   You know, or whatever that is, right?
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.160]   But I'm not gonna do that.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.880]   That's not who I am.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:28:00.960]   So maybe you're realizing that right now,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.160]   the despair in your life as we go through this series
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.060]   that you've done some terrible things.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.080]   You know, maybe that guy who had your heart
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.280]   convinced you to do things with him
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.760]   that you swore you'd never do.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.720]   And maybe you didn't need convincing.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.360]   Like, maybe you're numb to sex, right?
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.560]   Maybe you're just kind of at this place where,
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.520]   "Hey, honestly, like, if a guy would give me attention,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.360]   "like, I'll sleep with him.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.240]   "It's no big deal.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.480]   "That's just kinda where I'm at.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.340]   "If a girl will show me some affection, whatever.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.260]   "I'm down for whatever."
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.240]   Maybe that's where you're at.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.860]   Maybe you came in tonight with addictions
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.160]   that you've never even called addictions.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.400]   And it's all of a sudden, you lift your head up,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.320]   and you realize this porn thing's been going on
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.120]   since the fifth grade.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.780]   It's been over a decade, over two.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.880]   You're like, "Man, I think I got a problem.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.120]   "I've just been thinking that it's gonna fix itself.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.460]   "Maybe you've been raped.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.780]   "Maybe you've gone through sexual abuse,
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.580]   "and I'm not making light of that.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.740]   "I hate that for you.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.980]   "I hate that for you.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.240]   "Maybe you have made the choice to have an abortion,
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.760]   "and I want you to know that God is good,
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.960]   "and He loves you, and He's crazy about you.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.780]   "And now I've got a question for you.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.660]   "What's your story gonna be?
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.240]   "What's your story gonna be?
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.840]   "What story are you gonna write?
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.080]   "Are you gonna be that girl
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.020]   "that swears she's never gonna tell anyone
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.320]   "about that abortion, and she's gonna take it to her grave?
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.480]   "Are you gonna be that girl that says,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.760]   "'Hey, I had an abortion,
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.880]   "'and I wanna help others who have had abortions
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.760]   "'come from the bondage that I felt from that decision?'
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.020]   "Are you gonna be the girl that says,
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:45.860]   "'Yeah, you know what?
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.140]   "'I'm addicted to pornography, and I'm a girl,
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.040]   "'and girls don't talk about that,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.760]   "'but I wanna fight the porn industry now.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.700]   "'I wanna take my life and my story and my struggle,
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.000]   "'and I wanna set other people free from it.'
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.380]   "Are you gonna be the guy
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.580]   "that has sexual abuse occurred to you,
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.180]   "and so now you walk around as a victim,
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.980]   "carrying that burden on your shoulders?
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.080]   "Are you gonna be that guy that says,
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.960]   "'Yeah, you know, my uncle did that thing to me,
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:19.420]   "'but I wanna help you, and you, and you, and you.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.900]   "'Would you guys come and follow me,
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.300]   "'and can we sit and we talk about
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.100]   "'what's your story gonna be?'
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.840]   "Are you gonna be that person?"
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.240]   And you look backwards, and you realize
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.380]   it's hundreds of partners, or dozens of partners,
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.940]   or five partners.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.580]   And you're like, "You know, that's not who I am, though.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.180]   "I'm not that guy, I'm not that girl.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.280]   "I've been made new in Christ,
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.900]   "and so I'm gonna use my story to minister to others."
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.360]   'Cause 2 Corinthians 5:17 says that,
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.940]   "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.780]   "The old has gone, and the new has come."
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.340]   And so you, my friends, are not defined by your past.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.740]   You're defined by Christ's past,
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.880]   and he's redefining your future.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.040]   You're not defined by your past.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.380]   You're defined by Jesus's past,
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.880]   and he's changing your future.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.680]   And it's time that you found hope in that,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.300]   'cause I think as so-called Christians,
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.940]   we're walking around defeated,
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.800]   and that was never his intentions.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.000]   2 Corinthians 7, verse 10 says
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.680]   that there's this godly sorrow, this godly despair,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.680]   that brings repentance, that leads to salvation, freedom,
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.420]   and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow,
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.700]   shame, guilt, brings death.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.500]   See, I think often our disappointments
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.140]   and our despair brings us to things
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.780]   that we never thought would be,
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.180]   we never hoped to be, we never even fantasized about,
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.680]   and so one of those things is divorce.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.000]   And before we wrap up this series,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.840]   we just wanna talk about that.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.760]   I know that's a lot of your stories here tonight,
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.200]   and here's the crazy truth.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.040]   I'm just gonna hit you with this.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.600]   It hurts my heart to even say this.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.640]   For about over half of you, it will be your story.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.800]   For over half of the faces I'm looking at right now,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.480]   it's gonna be your story.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.400]   I know all of you are like, "Not me."
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.680]   Like you've seen the Disney movie
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.320]   where the prince comes in and rescues her,
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.360]   and they fall in love, and then they get a divorce?
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.940]   No, you haven't seen that one.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.360]   Right, that's not the one Disney makes.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.520]   And I know it wasn't the thing you fantasized about
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.360]   when you were growing up,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.960]   or were a little girl or a little guy,
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.280]   and so let's just talk about dealing with divorce.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.900]   First of all, for those who haven't been married,
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.480]   let me say to you, divorce is not an option, okay?
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.980]   And so for those of you that have gone through that,
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.560]   maybe you didn't know, maybe you hadn't read the scriptures,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.800]   grace abounds, God forgives your new creations.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.080]   But for those of you who haven't been married,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.600]   we're gonna skew that statistic,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.440]   because my prayer for all of us is that we would get married
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.080]   and none of us would get a divorce.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.320]   We know in Malachi 2:16, God says that he hates divorce,
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.640]   but God does not hate the divorced.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.720]   You need to know that.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.120]   He hates divorce, he hates the sin,
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.960]   he doesn't hate the sinner.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.160]   He loves the sinner.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.980]   And so divorce is not an option.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.140]   I want you to know for me it was.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.860]   Divorce was absolutely an option.
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.300]   In fact, I was so immature in my thinking,
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.860]   like I was just kinda looking at this girl,
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.640]   she was my best friend's sister,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.740]   and I loved her family, and I was like,
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.100]   man, I don't know, like I might as well get married.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.160]   You know, it'll be great, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.660]   Like I had all of these expectations,
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.500]   it'll be sex every night,
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.260]   and we have one big giant sexcapade,
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.180]   everybody knows that's what marriage is, you know.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.520]   I'm gonna learn Victoria's secret, you know.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.180]   And then we get there,
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.180]   and it didn't really happen like that,
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.780]   it's not really what played out.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.860]   And I just thought, hey, if this isn't what happened,
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.400]   if that's not how it goes, then we'll just jump out,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.240]   no big deal.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.640]   We'll just jump out, no big deal.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.640]   Get out of this thing, everybody's doing it, 52% of people.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.360]   So we'll just get out.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.520]   And so about two years into marriage,
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.060]   like where I'm at, I'm so immature,
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.720]   and this isn't that long ago, you know,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.560]   I'm embarrassed to tell you,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.760]   and so I'm throwing around the D word.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.840]   I don't know how to love a girl,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.600]   like I had dated like a lot of you date,
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.520]   which is serial dating, I jumped in a relationship,
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.600]   and when it went wrong, I jumped out,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.800]   and I jumped in another relationship,
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.920]   and it went wrong, I jumped out.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.640]   Now is that training for marriage,
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.200]   or is that training for divorce?
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.640]   See, this is why dating's important.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.040]   See, I had trained for divorce.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.880]   I had trained myself, I had conditioned myself for divorce.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.460]   And so here we were in marriage,
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.840]   and I'm like, man, I'll just, you know,
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.000]   you wanna act crazy, I'll just jump out.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.600]   It was really me acting crazy.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.020]   And it wasn't until I realized,
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.180]   like I started reading this,
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.320]   and I realized that out wasn't an option,
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.840]   and I'm like, man, if I'm gonna be with this woman
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.760]   for the rest of my life, I better start loving her,
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.560]   and I'm like, how should I love her?
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.080]   Yes, Christ loved the church,
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.240]   but Christ died for the church,
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.980]   gave himself for her, it's Ephesians 5:25.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.040]   Man, I better start giving my life for this woman.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.160]   And when I started doing that,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.900]   everything changed in our marriage.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.220]   She became this incredible woman of God,
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.000]   this amazing woman, she really already was,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.960]   I just couldn't see it, 'cause I was so wicked.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.260]   I was so messed up in my head,
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.720]   my expectations were so whack, and I was so angry.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.440]   But when I realized that divorce wasn't an option,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.980]   marriage finally was.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.560]   Marriage finally was an option.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.400]   And so I think the best training for marriage,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.480]   and I want you to hear me on this,
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.400]   'cause this is important, people never believe me on this,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.680]   and I promise you it's true, you're gonna find out.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.080]   I think the best training for marriage
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.440]   is dealing with conflict well.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.480]   That's the very best way for you to train for your marriage,
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.540]   is to have a roommate, a really dysfunctional roommate.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.320]   Like one that leaves the dishes out,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.140]   and doesn't pay rent on time,
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.880]   like that is excellent training for marriage, you know?
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.080]   Monica's like, babe, have you paid this bill?
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.320]   I haven't, you know?
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.760]   I'm that dysfunctional roommate.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.980]   Monica has that dysfunctional roommate,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.760]   leaves the dishes in the sink,
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.800]   that's great training for marriage.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.340]   For you to go to your community group,
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.880]   and when you really hate the person
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.680]   that you're sitting across the circle with,
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.320]   you're diligent, the scripture says,
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.160]   in preserving the unity of the spirit,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.320]   and the bond of peace.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.440]   You take that conflict head on,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.520]   you remove the log in your eye,
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.820]   you say, what have I done?
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.400]   What is my part in this conflict?
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.440]   I am committed to resolving it with you,
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.800]   because we are both brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.040]   And so we must bring down these walls.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.240]   We will wrestle with this until there is forgiveness
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.080]   between brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.960]   That is incredible training for marriage.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.660]   And so if you've been divorced,
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:16.640]   I want you to know that he's crazy about you,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.200]   he loves you.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.800]   I want you to know that there's grace there.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.960]   I'm the product of divorce,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.320]   both my parents had been married before,
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.080]   got divorced, remarried, had me,
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   still married now.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:32.280]   The first wedding I ever did here at Watermark,
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.400]   I had never even in my life considered divorce
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.800]   and remarriage, 'cause there's two options here,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.200]   and I want you to hear this.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.960]   There's divorce, like so, can we get a divorce?
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.920]   And then there's, can we get remarried?
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.640]   And they're not no-brainers.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.360]   Like, it is possible that you can get a divorce, okay?
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.840]   It's possible, and you don't remarry,
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.680]   and you stay single.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.060]   Like, you gotta wrestle with the scriptures
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.380]   that are there so that you can find the life
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.960]   that God has ordained for you,
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.440]   to say, hey God, here's where I'm at.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.640]   Is this an allotment for me,
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.560]   because of the broken world that we live in,
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.600]   is this possible?
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.520]   And so the first wedding I did was this girl,
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.720]   and we're wrestling, and I'm walking through the details
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.260]   of her first marriage, and what's so crazy
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.920]   about the stories, I actually saw them this weekend
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.520]   at a marriage conference I was speaking at right here,
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.200]   and it was this incredible thing,
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.920]   'cause I remember this like it was yesterday.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.800]   I went to her fiance, and I said,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.900]   I think she needs to pursue reconciliation,
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.480]   to her ex-husband.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.400]   And he said, what?
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.240]   Could you imagine?
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   Like, he loves this woman.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.640]   He's like, what?
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.760]   He goes home, he reads the scriptures,
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.700]   and he says, she absolutely does.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.760]   He says, I'm gonna call with her.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.480]   And he calls her ex-husband with her.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.280]   It's crazy.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.400]   I sat there with the ex-husband on speakerphone,
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.440]   and he had remarried, we didn't know that.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.580]   And so now he can walk,
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.000]   knowing that he was faithful, that she was faithful,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   as they stewarded that in their lives.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.840]   How great is that?
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.720]   Let me show you what the scripture says,
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.420]   and again, if this is your story,
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.560]   I don't say this to judge or to take blame.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   I say this because I'm committed to teaching the Bible,
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.780]   and this is what it says.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.200]   Jesus, chapter 19 of Matthew, verse three.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.600]   "Some Pharisees came to him and said,
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.560]   "they asked, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.160]   "for any and every reason?
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.700]   "Jesus responds, haven't you read, he replied,
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.800]   "that at the beginning the Creator made them male?"
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.280]   So they're asking this question.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.760]   Is it lawful to get a divorce?
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.760]   Jesus says, "Haven't you read, he replied,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.300]   "that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.460]   "and said, for this reason a man will leave his father
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.780]   "and mother and be united to his wife,
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.600]   "and the two will become one flesh,
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.680]   "so that they are no longer two but one.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.940]   "Therefore what God has joined together,
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.400]   "let man not separate."
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.700]   And so in one word, what is Jesus' answer?
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.660]   No.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.340]   Jesus takes the long road to answer the question,
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.000]   no, it's not lawful.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.720]   What God has joined together, let man not separate.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.380]   And so if you're hearing, and that's a part of your story,
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.060]   I know you feel justified in your divorce, frankly,
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.300]   because I've never met the person that's like,
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.880]   man, I got a divorce, and it was wrong.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.460]   I mean, I have seen people actually remarry each other,
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.380]   but very rarely do I talk to that person and say,
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.220]   hey, I know that it was wrong.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.480]   And so you may need to seriously,
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.540]   prayerfully consider reconciliation,
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.080]   and you may hate me for that.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.840]   I'm well aware that I'm hated for that often,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.220]   but it's for this reason, as I search the scriptures,
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:48.380]   that my personal conviction is that I won't remarry someone
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:54.840]   if reconciliation is an option,
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.020]   if their ex is alive or not remarried.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.180]   And do you know that people hear that,
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.020]   and they actually leave, and they're like,
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.820]   that place is crazy, did you know
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.140]   that that's where they stand, the JP's crazy?
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.820]   Before you go there, I encourage you to do a little reading.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.740]   Okay, 'cause I've been reading.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.880]   And just check out what the scripture says,
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.620]   so that you can make an informed decision,
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.540]   because the God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.220]   he loves you, he's crazy about you,
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.480]   and he has some desires for you.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.860]   Okay, he doesn't want to rip you off,
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.980]   he wants to give you life abundantly,
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.620]   the most amazing life that you could have ever imagined.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.820]   And so you may say, hey, of course,
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.780]   I was justified in my divorce, but let's be honest,
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.420]   you have no idea what God was going to do.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.400]   Because my God, he changes people.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.580]   And people are like, well, she was crazy.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.980]   I'm like, you married crazy.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.260]   Like, you chose crazy, right?
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.820]   Like, you stood there before God and said,
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.800]   hey, I want a covenant with crazy here.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.120]   Right?
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.420]   And you didn't, it wasn't if then,
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.220]   it wasn't if she's not crazy, then,
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.560]   it was, hey, if she goes crazy, I'm gonna stay with her.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.800]   That's why the notebook actually has some redeeming elements
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.640]   in it, she went crazy.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.880]   And he, yeah, we brought it back to the notebook, I did.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.900]   And he stayed with her.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.200]   God is at work.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.940]   Let's just end here, we'll talk about some disappointments
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.920]   from the scriptures.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.260]   There's some real disappointments in the scriptures, okay?
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.860]   There's some real despairs in the scriptures.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:28.920]   Let's go disappointments.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.780]   Abraham, okay, so God talks about,
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.260]   so Abraham's God's man, man of faith,
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.820]   he promised that he's gonna have a kid.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.660]   The problem with that is he's 75 years old,
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.300]   this is Genesis 16, and so the reality of it is,
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.780]   is after, you know, a decade goes by, some time goes by,
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.980]   Abraham's like, hey God, can I trust you?
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.220]   I don't think I can trust you anymore.
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.620]   He stops trusting God, he takes matters in his own hands
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.360]   and he has an affair with his servant.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.560]   But God makes good on his promise.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.760]   You think that when God said, hey, you're going to have
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.820]   a child and a lot of time goes by and he doesn't have one,
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.780]   that he's not dealing with disappointment?
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.280]   He absolutely was.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.540]   We can talk about Isaac, his son for a minute, right?
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.500]   He meets Rebecca, who seemed to be an amazing woman,
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.500]   because she's at a place where servants hang out
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.820]   and she's serving people, and so here's kind of
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.640]   meeting your spouse 101, go to a place where servants
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.420]   hang out and find someone serving people, right?
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.380]   That's what we learned from the story of Isaac and Rebecca.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.440]   That's where she is, and so she's taking care of some folks.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.980]   They get married and everything seems to be good,
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.380]   except for he goes, has to go to this Philistine king
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.340]   of Bimelech, and he lies and says that she's his sister,
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.420]   and the scripture implies that some of the Philistine army
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.260]   is about to sleep with this woman because he lied.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.740]   Dealing with some disappointment, Isaac and Rebecca were,
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.500]   and then there's Jacob, this is a crazy story.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:53.660]   The Bible has some crazy stories of despair and discouragement.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.740]   Jacob, right, sees this woman, falls in love with her.
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.540]   Rachel goes to her dad, says, hey, I'll work seven years
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.420]   for her, he does it, hey, ladies, marry a guy
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.180]   that will work seven years for you, okay?
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.500]   Moral to the story, works seven years for her, okay?
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:15.500]   The wedding comes, the wedding night, and the dad tricks him
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.740]   and he actually marries and sleeps with the older,
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.300]   much less attractive sister.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.460]   That's crazy, he slept with the wrong girl.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.540]   Wakes up the next day like, what, who are you?
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.220]   You know, was I drunk last night, what happened?
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.300]   He probably was.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.500]   It's in your Bible.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.180]   And so, here's the deal.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.820]   Here's the deal, I wanted to hit you with this.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:45.500]   Leah's lot in life was to be married to a man
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.540]   who actually was in love with her sister.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.220]   That was her lot in life, man.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.060]   You talk about disappointment, that actually feels
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.500]   more like despair to me, that she would marry
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.300]   that like her lot in life was to marry a man
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.860]   who actually wanted to be married to her sister.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.740]   So let's talk about Tamar for a second, okay?
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.140]   This is a real character.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.900]   Tamar marries Judah's son, Judah's son sins
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.980]   and dies because of his sin, marries Judah's other son
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.860]   who sins and dies because of his sin,
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.540]   so now she's a widow twice, two times over.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.860]   Judah promises her his youngest son
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.940]   and then he doesn't make good on that promise,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.260]   so she despairs, okay?
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:32.260]   She's been abused and so she dresses up like a prostitute,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.020]   sleeps with her father-in-law and gets pregnant.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:40.380]   Crazy, despair.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.420]   Ruth, and before we go to Ruth, we'll talk about Rahab.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.900]   Married Salman, Rahab was a prostitute,
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.220]   you probably heard of her, she hid some spies.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.340]   She had sex with men to honor foreign gods.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.500]   That was her job, she got paid for sex.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.140]   Okay, despair.
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.580]   Ruth, her husband dies, she loses her husband,
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.500]   she essentially goes with her mother-in-law,
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.180]   she's begging for food, right?
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.660]   She meets Rahab, the prostitute's son, Boaz.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.620]   She marries Boaz after her bold move,
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.860]   Jedi game that Ruth had,
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.860]   and so her and Boaz are now married, right?
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.100]   And so that's kind of her lot in life.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.260]   And then lastly, we'll talk about David,
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.860]   the man after God's own heart.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.100]   He had seven wives.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:35.540]   He has an affair with Bathsheba.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.140]   We're talking about divorce?
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.260]   Like he doesn't say, "Hey, Bathsheba, go get a divorce."
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.580]   He just kills her husband.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.500]   Crazy.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.740]   You're talking about despair?
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.440]   These are crazy stories.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.860]   I wanna show you something.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.300]   See, none of these folks, you're like,
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.380]   "JP, where are you going with this man?
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.900]   "Lay in this plane.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.980]   "You gotta go home."
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.380]   Here we go.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.020]   None of these guys fantasized that that would be their story.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.140]   Leah, as a little girl, dreamed of Disney
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.780]   and be like, "Man, I hope I marry this guy
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.580]   "who actually loves my sister
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.860]   "and married me by accident."
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.460]   Right, that's not what she dreamt of.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.700]   But that's what happened.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.660]   But God's bigger than that,
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.860]   because do you know that all those people
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.700]   I just told you about, you know,
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.260]   they're all kind of spread out throughout the Old Testament,
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.860]   and then they all show up in the same place
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.700]   in the New Testament, all in the same place,
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.860]   on the same page in your Bible.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.180]   Can I read it to you before we end?
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.780]   Let me just read it to you, Matthew 1.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.900]   A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.060]   the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.020]   Abraham was the father of Isaac.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.140]   Isaac, the father of Jacob.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.780]   Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.180]   Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah,
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.180]   whose mother was Tamar.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.660]   Perez, the father of Hezron.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.300]   Hezron, the father of Ram.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.180]   In verse five, Salmon, the father of Boaz,
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.740]   whose mother was Rahab the prostitute.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.540]   Boaz, the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.260]   Obed, the father of Jesse.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.940]   And Jesse, the father of King David.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.340]   David was the father of Solomon,
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.820]   whose mother had been Uriah's wife Bathsheba.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.100]   And Jacob, the father of Joseph.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.700]   Verse 16 now, the husband of Mary,
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:20.900]   of whom was born Jesus, who is called the Christ.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.100]   Don't hope in fantasy.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.340]   You hope in Jesus.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.700]   Your life is not about you.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.380]   Your singleness is not about you.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.980]   Your marriage is not about you.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.140]   Your dating is not about you.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.580]   Marriage is not for happiness.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.940]   Marriage is for holiness.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.100]   It is God conforming you to the image
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.900]   and character of Christ.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.420]   Singleness is not for happiness.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.420]   It's for holiness.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.860]   You're here for that long.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:02.380]   Then you die, and then you're with God forever
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:06.140]   and ever and ever and ever and ever,
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.140]   and that's the truth.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.540]   And that's as simple as I can give it to you.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:15.660]   And so my wife, Monica, she is a great girl.
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.740]   An amazing woman, an incredible wife.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.820]   She is a miserable savior.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.900]   And I'm a worst one.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.100]   Don't you see what God did there?
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:31.100]   God took Rahab, the prostitute, and made her a princess.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:36.300]   God took Ruth, the widow, and made her a princess.
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.860]   He took these whacked out guys and made them kings,
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.260]   heirs to the kingdom.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.660]   That's what God did.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.380]   He put the king of kings, the Lord of lords,
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.420]   in their lineage.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.660]   So Presley and Finley, the reality of it is,
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.580]   is they're not pursuing some fantasy.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.700]   Presley and Finley are princesses,
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.180]   not because of the prince charming that's going to come,
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.260]   but because of the one who's come.
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.380]   Because of the rescuer.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:05.100]   The one who came 2,013 years ago,
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.700]   a baby born in a manger,
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.660]   lived a sinless life for about 33 years,
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.020]   and said, "Presley and Finley and Kelly
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.740]   "and Jennifer and Sarah and Kim and Ashley
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:22.780]   "and Michael and Scott and Kenny and David and John,
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.160]   "I'm here to rescue you.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.800]   "All that junk you've done,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.420]   "that thing you did with that guy you swore you'd never do,
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.820]   "that thing you looked at,
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.800]   "that abortion,
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.880]   "that thing you did by yourself,
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.220]   "like I'm here and I'm dying for it.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.360]   "And your little life, your little 60 years,
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:48.940]   "your little 50 years, 80 years, it's about me.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:52.500]   "You pursue me, okay?
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:57.140]   "You pursue me, and I'll take care of that other stuff."
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.980]   You trust in the Lord with all your heart,
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.220]   and you don't lean on your own understandings,
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.940]   but in everything, you acknowledge Him.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.560]   And I'll say your pastorate, I got you.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.760]   God says He's got you.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.360]   He's good and you can trust Him.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.940]   He's good and you can trust Him.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.920]   You don't have to wanna play house, okay?
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.240]   You can play servant of the Most High God, all right?
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.480]   You hope in Him, hope in Christ.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.320]   Let me pray.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.960]   God, you are holy
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.240]   and mighty
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.720]   and good.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:44.040]   Father, you save us in spite of us.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.180]   Father, you change us, kicking and screaming.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.800]   Lord, I pray that you would take those of us
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.440]   who are wrestling with your word
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.480]   and we're looking like, how could God want that from me?
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.000]   And I pray that you would renew it in our spirit.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.760]   Anything that I said, Father, tonight,
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.160]   that was not of you, I pray that it would be forgotten
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.800]   before they leave here, as I pray often.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.160]   But anything that I said that is consistent
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.800]   with your spirit and consistent with the truth
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.120]   of your scriptures, Father, I pray that you would stir it
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.400]   in our hearts and our minds so that we can't forget it,
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.460]   we can't shake it.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.320]   Lord, thank you for the work that you do.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.140]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.300]   (silence)
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.460]   (silence)
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:39.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
