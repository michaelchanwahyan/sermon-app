[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.260]   - All right, let's do it.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.540]   Help me welcome our friends

[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.960]   and Porch Live Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   Let's give it up for Dallas to our friends watching online.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.200]   Of course, my friends in the room,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.680]   so glad you guys are here.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.960]   We are in our fourth week of our series, Anti-Suppressants,
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.000]   where we are addressing the things
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.840]   that we have been shoving down deep, deep, deep.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.120]   And just right off the bat,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.200]   here's where we're heading tonight.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200]   Tonight, we're talking about
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.720]   no longer suppressing insecurity,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.160]   no longer suppressing our insecurities.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.880]   And so we've got to all be in each other's business.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.840]   And so this message actually made me really insecure.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.560]   And so I'll just start off with a bat,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.000]   but you know what else made me insecure?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.340]   I have, you know, being up here, you know,
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.320]   usually every week, just as a weekly opportunity
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.300]   for me to make sure I really understand
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.620]   where my security comes from.
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.860]   And I usually do okay at it.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.080]   I'm learning, I'm getting better,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.200]   but situations like a couple of weeks ago happened
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.020]   just unexpectedly.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.720]   A friend asked me to send him my last talk.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.680]   I went to YouTube, I clicked the link.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   I usually keep myself from going and reading any comments,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.840]   but every now and then YouTube displays that one comment.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.200]   And I was like, and I read it.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.160]   And here's what it said.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.080]   J.D. Rogers, first off, put some respect on my name.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.960]   There's a D in that last name.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.680]   You dress like a clown.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.260]   You preach like a clown.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.220]   No fear of the Lord in you at all,
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.480]   but there's still time to repent
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.020]   and hallow the name of Jesus alone.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.320]   Reformed one, I just want to say,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.760]   thank you for your feedback.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.440]   I apparently did not listen with these pants.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.280]   I get it.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.100]   I was like, you know what?
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.940]   I went and looked at photos.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.760]   I was like, I kind of do dress like a clown,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.440]   but hopefully I don't preach like a clown.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.240]   Second time, going back and further and further
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.560]   on my insecurities of J.D.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.640]   In college, my first crush, I'm a freshman,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.480]   I'm in the band, so I'm really cool.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.100]   And I decided that my first,
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.400]   hey, it was drumline though, okay, I will say.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.540]   Yeah, I wore the bandana and all that.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.780]   But my first crush, I decided to just aim high.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.260]   And she was like the it Christian girl athlete
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.540]   on the volleyball team.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.180]   And she was just kind of the known
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880]   like Christian girl on campus.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.660]   And I was like, might as well shoot my shot.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.180]   And so I'm like texting her, you know,
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.960]   trying to like make my way in.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.260]   And her friend, this girl is probably like an Enneagram too,
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.280]   I would say, but her friend was an Enneagram eight.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.080]   And so one day she just walked up to me and she's like,
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.940]   hey buddy, come here, come here.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.920]   And she's like, I'm just gonna let you know
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.620]   because she won't.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.580]   She probably will never, I mean,
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.460]   she will never date a guy who's under six foot
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.260]   and not an athlete.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.600]   And I know, I know, I'm obviously healed from it.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.300]   But I remember in that moment being like,
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.200]   well, dang, I don't think I can ever like,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.100]   maybe cowboy boots, I don't think I'm gonna be able
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.300]   to fix this.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   So how do I deal with this now insecurity in my heart?
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.380]   Let's go back even further, a preteen JD.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.020]   So I grew up in the country, small town, East Texas,
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.240]   yee yee stuff all the time.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.380]   I know it's hard to believe.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.500]   And the 903, Beast, Texas.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.340]   And so in my hometown, it was so country.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.260]   And this is like in the 21st century.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260]   If someone's barn were to like have like in a storm,
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.440]   like a big limb fall on it or somehow to burn down,
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.720]   like people from our church locally would come
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.620]   and like have a day dedicated to rebuild a barn.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.160]   And it was like a whole thing.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.240]   The women would cook and the men would be building.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.740]   And I'm sure some women helped by the way, okay.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.300]   From the country.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.760]   And so I remember wanting to immediately,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.140]   I don't know what instinctively gave me this desire,
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.980]   but I remember in this moment as a preteen boy,
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.040]   I wanted to prove that I was worthy of being a man
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.220]   around all these older men.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.140]   And I remember there was this moment where,
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.220]   I guess it was the rite of passage looking back now,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.980]   but my dad was like, "Hey JD, go to the old barn
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.060]   "and get a board stretcher.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.180]   "We need it for this project.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.580]   "Go get a board stretcher."
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.420]   And so I'm like, "Okay."
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.960]   And I'm thinking, I have no idea what a board stretcher is,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.380]   but like, I can't let them know that
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.580]   because that'll make me less of a man.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.960]   And so I like, you know, go across the yard.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.580]   I'm running over to the old barn and I'm just like,
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.740]   "Okay, process of elimination.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.280]   "That's a shovel, that's a hoe, that's a hammer.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.520]   "I don't know what that is.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.300]   "This must be a board stretcher."
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.500]   And so I grab it and I come out and I'm like,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.660]   "Dad, is this it?"
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.180]   He's like, "Yeah."
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.980]   And so I'm like, "Yes, I did it."
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.260]   And so I'm running across and I go to give him this tool
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.420]   and everyone just starts laughing.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.060]   And my dad, I mean, people are hitting their knees
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.620]   like on their back, like slow motion, like,
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.300]   (JD laughing)
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.300]   and I'm like, young me is like looking around like, "No."
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.240]   And everyone is like,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.720]   "There's no such thing as a board stretcher."
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.640]   And I remember my chin started to quiver.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.220]   I know.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.860]   And my dad was like, "Uh-oh."
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.660]   And I ran away and I was sitting alone.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.960]   And in that moment, as a young boy, I thought to myself,
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.920]   I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get out of this town.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.460]   If this is what being a country man is about,
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.120]   knowing things and doing things,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.020]   things that just weren't natural to me for whatever reason,
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.940]   but if this is what it takes and this is how they are,
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.720]   I want nothing to do with it.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.420]   And at a young age, what was just a funny moment
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.860]   for whatever reason stuck in my mind
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.820]   and then it took root in my heart.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.620]   And for the rest of my junior high and high school
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.060]   and the college years, I worked and worked and worked
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.940]   'cause my parents didn't go to college.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.260]   I didn't have a fund waiting for me.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.380]   People from my town don't usually get out.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.060]   It's one of those places.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.980]   But I was like, I will do whatever it takes.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.260]   And you know what that created?
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.780]   It created something in me that I didn't get to enjoy things
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.620]   out of a place of security and just being JD.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.300]   No, it was all birthed out of insecurity to prove something
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.380]   which created an exhausted young man.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.180]   And I think if right now I say,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.420]   hey, do you struggle with insecurities?
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.300]   There might be some of you who would say,
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.780]   no, I'm a pretty confident person.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.300]   But the reality is we don't even realize
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.620]   until we're really talking about it and doing a deep dive,
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.860]   we don't realize how much of our lives
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.980]   are just riddled with insecurity.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.260]   I mean, think about all the times,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.160]   think about why you select that photo.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.180]   You took 10 photos.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.460]   Why did you pick that one?
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.540]   Because there was something that you saw
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.420]   that you liked better about yourself
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.340]   or how you were standing or how you looked.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.580]   You didn't look at your friends, boom, you looked at you.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.340]   And that was the one you picked.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.540]   Forget your friends.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.100]   Your Instagram is for you.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.460]   You're trying to get shows.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.700]   Or think about when you're about to speak up
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.660]   in a work meeting,
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.660]   there's some of you that you can barely speak.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.020]   Some of you might have never spoken up in a work meeting,
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.980]   but you're just thinking and thinking and thinking.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.660]   And you wanna make sure it's so profound and so calculated.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.860]   And you wanna make sure that you sound really smart
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.120]   and like you're worthy to have a seat at the table
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.420]   because you're insecure about your competency.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.000]   Or maybe your finances.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.140]   Somehow, your friends are hanging out,
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.340]   your coworkers at happy hour, your salaries come up.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.620]   Like, what do you make?
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.620]   What do you make?
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.580]   What do you make?
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.820]   And you're like over or under 50.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.660]   And you're like over.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.500]   And they're like, well, how much?
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.340]   Bro, you can tell me and I'll tell you.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.020]   And you know, you add the numbers up some
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.300]   because you're like, I wanna look like
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.240]   I'm making a little more bank than this.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.320]   But it's because you're insecure.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.640]   You don't think it's enough.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.740]   And you think that is what points to who you are.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.300]   I mean, the amount of times we look in a mirror a day,
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.180]   when you're in your car before you get out,
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.780]   you're looking in your phone, selfie camera,
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.260]   making sure nothing's in your teeth
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.940]   because you're going, whenever I walk into this building,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.900]   I'm not thinking about who I am.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.060]   I'm thinking about who I am through their eyes.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.520]   Because I just want to find security.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.720]   So much of who we are is riddled by insecurity.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.740]   Maybe your mom at a young age made a comment
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.740]   about your weight.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.180]   And you have thought about what you eat
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.120]   and how much you work out.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.700]   And it's not just 'cause you wanna be healthy
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.240]   and you wanna live and steward your body
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.200]   like God calls you to,
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   but it's because you don't want to feel overweight.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.940]   And it's birthed from that thing your mom
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.540]   or that guy said about you.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.060]   Or maybe because your dad only acknowledged you
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.940]   when you were succeeding growing up.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.580]   Everything now is about climbing the corporate ladder
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.180]   because you're insecure about what if you fail.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.140]   Tonight, last week, the last time I talked,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.460]   I talked about David, King David, his greatest failure.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.900]   I love King David.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.960]   Talked about his greatest failure.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.180]   And tonight I hope to redeem him
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.920]   'cause we're gonna talk about a familiar story
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.100]   where we highlight one of his greatest moments
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.860]   in history of being a King.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.300]   It's David versus Goliath.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.600]   And a lot of you might know this story from your childhood.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.040]   You might know about the slingshot
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.880]   and all that stuff with the giant.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.340]   But I actually want to talk about the path
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.060]   to David's purpose in that moment.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.540]   Because the path to get to that battle
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.340]   and that victory in that moment
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.500]   was riddled with opportunity after opportunity
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.680]   for potential security, insecurity.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.940]   But what we see and what I want us to model out of David
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.100]   in his young adult years,
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.360]   I mean, this was a man that we're gonna see was very secure,
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.300]   but he wasn't secure in himself.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.420]   That's the main thing I want.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.820]   If you're gonna write down anything tonight
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.460]   in your phone or in your journal, write down this.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.820]   The objective of tonight's message is this.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:31.240]   This message is to intend to show us who we are
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.780]   in light of who God is.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.220]   Tonight, we're gonna see who we are
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.860]   in light of who God is.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.700]   'Cause I think a lot of times
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.900]   when you talk about insecurity,
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.020]   what the world's gonna feed you is who you are
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.500]   and stop there.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.060]   Hey, you know, you're beautiful.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.020]   Hey, no, you're this.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.860]   Hey, no, you're that.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.720]   And sure, it feels good for about 10 minutes.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.700]   And then you lay down at night alone and boom,
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.980]   all the anxieties and insecurities are back.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.340]   And so that's why it's really important
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.340]   that you hear me say tonight,
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.440]   you're hitting who you are in light of who God is.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.420]   Because who you are by yourself,
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.220]   you will remain riddled with insecurity.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.240]   But if you see yourself in light of who God is,
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   it can change everything for your life like it did David's.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.700]   Like it did David's.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.200]   And so if you will, if you have your Bible,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.540]   open up to 1 Samuel 17.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.340]   1 Samuel 17.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.840]   And as you head there,
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.320]   I want to go ahead and just,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.720]   this is a very long chapter,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.000]   so we're not gonna read it all.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.120]   So I need you guys really dialed in, really focused in.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.220]   And I know you think I already know this story.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.200]   I really think you might not have seen it
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   from this perspective.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.520]   So lock in with me.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.000]   Anytime we're reading or we're talking about the storyline,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.800]   it's really important that you track with me.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.600]   So here's what we see.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.240]   Saul, tall, dark, and handsome.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.360]   He's elected king by the people of Israel.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.280]   Think the coolest guy in high school,
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.120]   the quarterback, the jock.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.920]   He had everything going on for him.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.340]   That's who's king right now.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.880]   And then in 1 Samuel 16,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.520]   Saul is really upset in the Lord.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.520]   And so God tells Samuel to go and anoint a new king.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.880]   And he says to go to the house of Jesse.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.480]   And so he goes to Jesse's house and he says,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.400]   "Bring me all your sons."
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.200]   And so Jesse brings all of his sons,
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.240]   oldest to the youngest.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.580]   And God says to Samuel,
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.280]   "Hey, don't look on the outside appearance like man does.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.300]   "I look at the heart.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.360]   "I wanna pick someone who's a man after my own heart."
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.040]   So he goes through all the sons
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.260]   and basically God's like,
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.760]   "Nope, not him, not him, not him, not him."
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.860]   And then Samuel goes,
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.960]   "Are you sure all of your sons are here?"
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.800]   And like the run of the bunch,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.560]   Jesse's like, "Oh yeah, I do have one son,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.440]   "but he's like the short youngest kid named David.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.700]   "He's probably out like running around
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.160]   "frolicking with the sheeps.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.240]   "I don't think he's your guy."
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.600]   And he's like, "Call him."
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.440]   And so he brings David,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.680]   says he was kind of short, ruddy, but he was handsome.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.720]   He did have that going for him.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.400]   And so he brings him up and God says, "This is him."
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.300]   So now he's anointed king, but this is important.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.800]   Although he was anointed and promised to one day be king,
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.360]   he was not yet king.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.880]   There was a calling and a mantle on his life,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.360]   but just because there was a calling
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.600]   does not mean there was not a path
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.000]   that still had to be taken to prepare him
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.080]   to get to that calling.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.000]   There was an anointing placed on him,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.560]   but there was still preparation to be done.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.800]   And so he goes back to shepherding the sheep.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.560]   And there he is.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.240]   And there's this, you go to this other scene now
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.600]   in first Samuel chapter 17 and picture this.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.320]   There's like the big bad army known as the Philistines.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.120]   Some say Philistines, I'm gonna say Steens
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.360]   'cause I'm from East Texas.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.680]   The Philistines are on this side, then there's a valley.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.320]   And then the Israelite army is on this side.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.600]   And for 40 days, this giant known as Goliath
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.400]   would come down and the acoustics of the valley
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.520]   would make his voice echo up to the Israelites.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.440]   And he would say, "Here's the deal I'm willing to propose.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.620]   "You can send down one soldier in gladiator style.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.440]   "We will fight till the death.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.880]   "If he beats me, the Philistines will be a slave to Israel.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.520]   "If I beat him, you will be a slave to us."
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.060]   And it says that the Israelites,
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.960]   no one was willing to go down and fight him.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.920]   Everyone shook in terror and fear.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.640]   They were insecure.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.800]   And one day, just a normal day,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.120]   David's in the fields and he had no idea.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.760]   He woke up just okay with being a shepherd boy.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.240]   He had no idea who's about to be sent
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.860]   to be a soldier on the front line of God's battle.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.220]   And his dad calls him in and he says,
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.140]   "Hey son, I want you to go.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.780]   "I want you to take this charcuterie board
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.580]   "of meat and cheese to the soldiers.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.780]   "They're probably hungry.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.940]   "It's snack time, take them a Lunchable.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.900]   "I want you to pack it up, go get a report.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.520]   "Tell me how your brothers are doing."
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.700]   So David's like, okay.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.380]   He leaves the sheep with someone else to watch them
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.420]   and he heads to the battle.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.420]   He's there, he's working his way through,
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.020]   looking for his brothers.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.500]   He starts to pass out some food.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.060]   People are, you know, all the soldiers are grabbing it
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.280]   and he's like trying to find his brothers.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.280]   And as he's there, he hears the same taunt from Goliath
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.940]   that's been going on for 40 days.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.100]   "Send someone down to fight me.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.620]   "If I win, we take Israel.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.660]   "If you win, you can have us, the Philistines."
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.040]   And this is what happens.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.080]   First Samuel 17, 22.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.040]   "David left his things with the keeper of supplies
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.340]   "and hurried out to the ranks to greet his brothers.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.460]   "And as he was talking with them,
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.060]   "Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath,
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.680]   "came out from the Philistine ranks.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.980]   "Then David heard him shout his usual taunt
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.300]   "to the army of Israel.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.080]   "As soon as the Israelite army saw him,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.660]   "they began to run away in fright.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.300]   "'Have you seen the giant?' the men asked.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.240]   "He comes out each day to defy Israel.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.000]   "The king has offered a huge reward
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.500]   "to anyone who kills him.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.820]   "He will give that man one of his daughters for a wife,
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.740]   "and the man's entire family
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.440]   "will be exempted from paying taxes.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.320]   "David asked the soldier standing nearby,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.340]   "what will a man get for killing the Philistine
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.640]   "and ending his defiance of Israel?
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.200]   "Who is this pagan Philistine anyway
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.420]   "that he is allowed to defy the armies of the living God?
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.420]   "And these men gave David the same reply.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.200]   "They said, yes, that is the reward for killing him."
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.800]   So immediately what we see is in this opportunity
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.820]   where David is met with an enemy who is taunting his God,
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.040]   where everyone else has bowed down
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.640]   and insecurity has been frightened,
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.800]   David immediately has a different response.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.920]   He immediately is like, who's this guy think he is
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.280]   that he thinks that he can stand up
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.500]   and defy the people of God?
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.780]   What gave him that kind of security?
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.280]   A little shepherd boy,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.720]   how can he suddenly go to this place?
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   How can he be so confident?
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   How can he walk in his purpose and his calling
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.000]   without any experience?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.080]   That's what we're gonna see.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.620]   We're gonna learn from this story in David's life,
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.800]   how to fight your insecurities,
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.320]   how to fight your insecurities.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.500]   The reason why I want us to really know
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.140]   how to identify and fight insecurities
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.080]   is because I believe as the people of God,
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.440]   there are gonna be only more and more opportunities
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.400]   for us to walk in our purpose and our calling
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.880]   as children of light in a dark world.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.380]   But we are promised in John chapter 16, verse 33,
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.560]   that in this world, and I don't have to convince you,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.040]   you see that in this world, you will have trouble.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.900]   You will have people who disagree.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.120]   You will have people who fight, who rage on social media,
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.840]   who are looking for what you have to say in your workplace.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.320]   In this world, it says you will have trouble.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.840]   You will.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.520]   And anytime a child of God has an opportunity,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.260]   they will be met with opposition.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.100]   They will.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.480]   That's what happens when you look different.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.520]   You will be met with opposition.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.140]   But if you are insecure, you will be like the Israelite army.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.680]   You will shrink back instead of stepping into the purpose
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.380]   and calling that God has for you.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.480]   But that was not David's story.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   David stood up when everyone else fell back
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.960]   because he understood how to fight insecurity.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   So number one, how to fight your insecurity.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.280]   Check the source of your insecurity.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.540]   Check the source of your insecurity.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:49.320]   So whenever a lie or a doubt
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.140]   or something harsh about yourself or an insecurity
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.800]   comes into your mind,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.120]   the first thing you can do to fight against it
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.880]   is not to just dismiss it.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.000]   Men, I'm especially talking to you.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.220]   Not just to suppress it and shove it down,
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.060]   but it's to address it
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.000]   and then identify the source of where it's coming from.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.140]   Where is this coming from?
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.060]   Who is saying this to me?
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.180]   What is informing this thought?
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.740]   Before David made it to fight against Goliath
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.900]   and to walk in his calling,
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.260]   I want you to see the opposition that he met.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.360]   It came from family.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.020]   It came from authority.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.500]   It came from his enemy.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.940]   It came from every which way.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.700]   Look at this.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.460]   Check the source of your insecurity.
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.700]   In verse 28.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.220]   So David's like, "Hey, who is this guy?
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.140]   "Let me at him.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.980]   "I'll take him on.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.820]   "What's the reward?"
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.500]   And we see in verse 28,
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.340]   "But when David's oldest brother,"
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.620]   sometimes it'd be your own blood,
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.160]   "his oldest brother, Eliab,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.100]   "heard David talking to the men, he was angry."
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.820]   And if you're an older sibling,
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.220]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.780]   You know when your little brother or sister shows up
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.260]   and you're just annoyed for no reason?
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260]   You're just like, "Why are you here?"
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.840]   Or if you're the little sibling,
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.360]   you know what it's like for the older sibling to be like,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.380]   "Why are you here?"
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.780]   That's what's happened in this moment.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.500]   He was angry.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.340]   He said, "What are you doing around here anyway?"
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.420]   He demanded, "What about those few sheep?"
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.340]   I mean, he could have said sheep.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.780]   He could have said herd.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.940]   "What about those few sheep
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.180]   "you're supposed to be taking care of?
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.000]   "I know about your pride and deceit.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.380]   "You just wanna see the battle."
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.980]   Hold up.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.660]   God just anointed David in a chapter before this
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.180]   because he said that he was a man after God's own heart.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.060]   So what does he mean?
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.940]   I know that you're full of pride and deceit,
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.900]   that you just wanna be here to be a part of the action,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.420]   go back to your job.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.020]   But see, sometimes in life,
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.320]   we know that the people close to us can say things to us
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.060]   that cause our biggest insecurities.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.740]   Just because they are your family,
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.180]   just because they love you,
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.080]   just because they're your close friend
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.660]   does not mean that they're always gonna say
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.120]   everything right.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.220]   People are able to say things that can really damage you.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.380]   But the thing is, is you have an opportunity
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.700]   to believe it and live like it's true
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.780]   or to take it and reject it.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.460]   Basically what his brother is saying to him here is,
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.300]   "Hey, what are you doing here?"
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.020]   He's assigning motive to David.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.220]   He's like, "Get out of here.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.060]   "You don't belong here."
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.260]   And imagine the embarrassment as a little brother
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.340]   who looks up to his big brothers and all the soldiers.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.480]   Imagine the potential embarrassment he must've felt
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.840]   with all the other soldiers hearing him.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.400]   And he's like, "Get out of here.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.240]   "You don't belong here.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.660]   "Get back to your few sheep."
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.040]   Felt neglected.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.840]   I'm sure he felt really insecure,
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.540]   but also what he's calling him is an imposter.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.020]   He's saying, "You don't belong here."
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.060]   And I thought that was interesting
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.100]   because this week I did an Instagram box on my story
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.300]   and I just said, "Hey, what are some of the biggest things
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.760]   "that make you insecure?"
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.280]   And one of the top things by far,
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.320]   I'm gonna talk about four of the top things I realized
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.620]   that people said over and over.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.940]   One of the top things was imposter syndrome.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.220]   People now, because of social media
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.600]   or because they're living for other people's perception,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.020]   they're thinking about what other people think them,
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.340]   it's hard for them in their mind to reconcile what's real
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.680]   and what to show anymore.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.960]   Because everyone feels so insecure about who they are.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.840]   And so they're walking around going,
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.220]   "Wait, do I even know who I am?
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.320]   "Wait, when that person said that thing,
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.900]   "is that true?
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.500]   "What's true?"
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.540]   We can't tell what's true anymore.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.640]   But for those who know God,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.360]   for those who have a relationship with Jesus
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.040]   and abide with Him daily, you need to know,
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.000]   there are people that are gonna come for your motives.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.920]   There are people gonna come for your intentions
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.020]   and question why you posted what you did
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.680]   or why you won't say a certain thing in the workplace.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.480]   They're gonna come and say, "I know why you did that.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.360]   "You hate gay people."
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.320]   Or, "I know why you did that.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.380]   "You hate transgender people."
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.600]   Or, "The church and Christians hate, hate, hate."
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.000]   And they're gonna question your motive.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.680]   They're gonna question your intention.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   And if you let the wrong source inform your security,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.960]   you're gonna back down and not stand up.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.360]   The next one we see is Saul,
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.340]   tall, dark, and handsome, verse 33.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.360]   So Saul hears David causing a ruckus,
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.340]   and he's like, "What's the reward?
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.180]   "What's the reward?"
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.480]   And essentially Saul's like, "Bring him over here."
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.000]   And so David walks over to the king.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.840]   And here's what the king,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.140]   the biggest guy on the block, says to him.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.980]   "Don't be ridiculous," Saul replied.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.220]   "There's no way you can fight the Philistine
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.760]   "and possibly win.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.300]   "You're only a boy.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.680]   "And he's been a man of war since his youth."
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.360]   The second thing in the question box
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.320]   that I saw people say that they're most insecure by
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.560]   is something in them believes that they're too much.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.520]   They're too insecure, or they're too loud.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.760]   They're too annoying.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.840]   They're too much.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.320]   Insert whatever it is for you,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.440]   but they believe something.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.560]   Someone said something to them
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.520]   that made them believe they were too much.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.500]   But then what's funny is Saul then says,
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.000]   "There's no way you can beat this man
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.200]   "because essentially you're not enough."
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.800]   Which was the third thing that people said the most.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.980]   You had some people believing,
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.400]   "I'm so insecure because I believe I'm too much."
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.540]   Then you had a whole other group saying,
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.600]   "I'm too insecure 'cause I'm not enough."
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.760]   And that's what he's saying here.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.820]   Saul's saying, "Well, hey, don't be ridiculous.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.440]   "Calm down, you're just a boy.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.640]   "You're being too much."
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.060]   But then you also have him saying,
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:13.900]   "You're not enough.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.340]   "You can never beat this guy because you're just a boy.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.420]   "And this guy's been fighting since he was a boy."
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.200]   And there have been people that have told you
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.440]   or you've even told yourself
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.080]   or culture has told you, informed you
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.400]   that you have to look a certain way to be enough.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.440]   Or maybe because someone's never asked you out
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.800]   or swiped on you,
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.180]   or because you're always the person,
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.360]   you're the fifth wheel.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.680]   All these things point to,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.860]   "Well, what must it be?
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.600]   "In some way, I'm either too much or I'm not enough.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.320]   "That's why I'm never chosen."
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.800]   Or maybe when you were a kid,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.840]   you were just being yourself
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.700]   and someone said, "Hey, chill out."
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.160]   And so ever since then,
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.560]   you just feel like you're being yourself,
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.700]   but you're wondering the back of your mind,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.160]   "Is this too much?"
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.040]   And something's taking from you
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.480]   because you're listening to an unreliable source.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.000]   The last one we see is David's enemy, Goliath.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.960]   Saul lets him go and he's like,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.060]   "All right, your funeral.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.360]   "If you wanna go, you can go find him."
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.120]   And so he sends him down.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.880]   And this is what Goliath says.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.280]   "Goliath walked out toward David
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.460]   "with his shield bearer ahead of him,
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.960]   "sneering in contempt at this ruddy faced boy."
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.360]   I'm like, man, they really did him like that
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.500]   in the NLT version.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.200]   (laughing)
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.780]   He said, "Am I a dog," he roared at David,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.880]   "that you come at me with a stick?"
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.080]   Shout out to all my men
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.040]   who have been called a stick, by the way.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.720]   You were a late bloomer.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.600]   And I mean, I talked to a lot of guys
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.680]   and I'm like, man, what got you motivated?
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.240]   He's like, "To be completely honest, bro,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.160]   "I was a late bloomer."
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.480]   He's like, "When everyone else was like
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.540]   "hitting their growth spurt,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.880]   "when everyone else was like getting in the gym
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.940]   "and it was actually working,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.800]   "it wasn't until 10th grade, 11th grade
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.740]   "that I started actually like I hit my growth spurt.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.200]   "And for those four years, everyone made fun of me.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.740]   "Everyone told me I was little.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.400]   "Everyone told me I would never start.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.100]   "And so I had to work harder than everyone else
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.100]   "to prove something.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.160]   "The problem is now they're tall, dark, and handsome,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.520]   "and they still think they're a stick."
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.520]   Because they're trying to fix it themselves.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.360]   They still see themselves as that small junior high boy,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.440]   which tells me what is the actual solution?
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.560]   They've listened to a non-reliable source.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.000]   He says here, "Hey, what am I a dog
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.820]   "that you throw a stick in front of me?
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.280]   "I personally don't relate to David.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.800]   "I'm not team stick, I'm team thick.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.980]   "I have,
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.660]   "I've got a lot of love and I always have."
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.780]   And Jenna loves it.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.620]   And,
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.100]   and you know what song I relate to?
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.380]   The all of me loves all of you loves your curves.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.720]   That's like, I'm more that.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.640]   And so,
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.660]   mine is the opposite.
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.140]   Mine's like, oh, I'm too big.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.980]   And so I need to get smaller
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.060]   and then people will take me more serious.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.620]   Or maybe if I were taller like that girl,
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.060]   maybe that girl would have liked me back in college
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.940]   if I were taller.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.700]   You know, it never fails.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.820]   Every week I'm down here and, so just save it.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.420]   I'm gonna answer for all of you this week.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.020]   Every week I'm down here and someone comes down
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.060]   and they're like so excited.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.020]   They're like, "Hey."
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.860]   I'm like, "Hey."
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.680]   They're like, "First time at the porch.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.500]   "I came from out of town or came from the state."
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.060]   He's like, "I was introduced to the porch like two months ago
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.500]   "and I've like just been binging the porch."
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   And like, "What'd you say your name was again?"
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.260]   And I'm like, "JD."
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.740]   They're like, "JD, JD."
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.040]   And I'm like, "I'm not JP."
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.780]   And if you know, you know.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.540]   But they're like, "Yeah, I've been like,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.660]   "I started at the beginning
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.200]   "and like I've been listening to all this talks
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.460]   "and I thought it was JP."
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.820]   And I'm like, "Well, it was JP."
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.980]   And like, "I thought you'd be taller."
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.660]   And I'm like, "I'm not JP."
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.100]   And if I wanted to listen, I would be like,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.860]   "You know what?"
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.080]   When I drive home, I'm like, "I'm not JP.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.000]   "I'm not six foot seven.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.380]   "I'm not as wise as him.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.560]   "I'm not as smooth as him."
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.980]   And seriously, that guy's huge.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.020]   So you're like, "Six foot seven?
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.100]   "Guy's a giant."
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.380]   But you know what?
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.820]   That's an unreliable source
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.460]   because God doesn't want me to be up here and be JP.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.860]   He wants me to be JD.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.020]   And he wants you to be you.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.060]   He wants you to be you.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.620]   But the world and people are gonna make stupid comments
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.380]   that make you think I would be better
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.780]   if I were like so-and-so.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.440]   If I wasn't like this small, or if I wasn't this big,
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.880]   if I was just like this,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.660]   then people would see me and take me seriously.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.620]   Or someone would wanna ask me out.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.340]   And all these insecurities we let creep in
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.160]   because they're coming from an unreliable source.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.380]   So number one in how to fight securities,
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.540]   you got to be able to identify
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.260]   and check the source of your insecurity.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.340]   Where is this lie coming from?
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.340]   Y'all remember citing your source when you wrote papers?
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.500]   It's the worst part.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.180]   It's like, I'm like typing fire.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.220]   And then I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I gotta cite this paper."
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.100]   So then honestly what I do,
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.260]   I go to that like engine where you just like
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.320]   put the link in.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.840]   You know, MLA, APA, Chicago, whatever it might be.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.540]   It was the worst part.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.860]   But why was it the most,
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.300]   I mean, teachers would make sure you knew.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.500]   And if you don't cite your source, automatic fail.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.340]   You know, you gotta cite your source.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.180]   Why?
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.940]   Because they wanted to make sure
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.460]   that you understood the importance
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.280]   that what you were researching was reliable.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.860]   What informed your research?
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.220]   What informed what you were writing about a particular topic
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.820]   was it reliable?
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:12.700]   Which website were you not allowed to use?
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.320]   Wikipedia.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.160]   Why?
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.180]   Because anyone can go in at any time
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.920]   and say what they wanna say,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.700]   change what they wanna change,
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.220]   edit what they wanna edit.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.100]   And the problem is,
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.820]   if right now I were to go and cite the sources
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.600]   that inform who you are in a lot of your minds,
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.040]   you're using Wikipedia.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.840]   You're letting anyone, any day come in,
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.360]   say what they wanna say,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.080]   edit what they wanna edit,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.480]   take what you know to be true
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   and replace it with something else.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.960]   And you're letting an unreliable source
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.120]   determine who you are.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.060]   You need to check the source.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.220]   Where is this coming from?
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.260]   And then what do you do with that?
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.840]   Point two of how to fight insecurity.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.680]   You respond to the lies with truth.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.620]   So not only is it,
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.300]   you can't just stop acknowledging this is wrong
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.140]   or this is bad,
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.880]   you have to then be willing to change it.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.680]   You have to be willing to inform yourself
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.920]   of a reliable source.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.840]   So you have to be able to know truth.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.520]   Look at how David quickly responds
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.800]   to each of these responses.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.240]   So his brother, you know what he says?
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.840]   "Hey, why are you here?
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.860]   "Get out of here.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.880]   "I know your heart.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.740]   "Pry in your seat.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.300]   "Get back to your few sheep."
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.140]   What does he say?
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.220]   Verse 29.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.080]   "What have I done now, you nagging older brother?
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.080]   "I was only asking a question."
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.680]   He walked over to some other people
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.160]   and asked him the same thing and received the same answer.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.640]   Basically he hit him with that, thank you next.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.640]   Like he was like, thank you brother,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.960]   I'm going to the next people.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.320]   And he gave him no time.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.960]   Why?
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.880]   Because he understood this is not a reliable source.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.080]   And so he went somewhere more reliable.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   Some of you, you are giving way too much mental attention
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.440]   to people who want no good for you
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.200]   and have nothing good to say.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.920]   And you need to remove those people's words
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.180]   out of your mind and replace them with what is true.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.800]   What was the lie presented to David
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.120]   that could have made him insecure
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.440]   in this moment from his brother?
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.540]   He said, "Hey, get out of here.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.420]   "Get back to where you belong.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.340]   "I know your heart.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.560]   "I know your motives.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.840]   "You just want to be in the action, get back."
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.500]   But what did David know?
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.080]   A man after God's own heart.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.140]   He said, "God looks at my heart.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.800]   "It's only God who knows my heart."
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.560]   God truly is the only one.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.160]   And so people all day will want to say what they want to say
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.060]   about why you do what you want to do.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.000]   People might say, "Hey, you know,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.560]   "you might just generally love fashion.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.860]   "And so you just want to post."
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.560]   And maybe someone inspired you to want to get out
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.220]   and post what you're wearing.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.400]   But you think, "Well, what if people think my motives
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.580]   "is I want to be some like famous influencer?"
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.020]   And so you don't do anything.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.800]   Or man, maybe you actually just like teaching people
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.540]   about fitness and so you start posting workout videos
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.260]   or you start opening up an opportunity
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.740]   for your coworkers to come to a class,
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.080]   but then you think, "Well, I want to come off as that guy.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.740]   "What if people think my motives?"
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.740]   And you want to, like God wants to use you
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.120]   to bring God to the fitness world,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   but you let unreliable sources
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.880]   and people questioning your motives and perceptions
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.020]   keep you from doing something great for God
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.860]   and using what he's called you to do
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.620]   for his good and his glory.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.820]   And guess what?
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.980]   I had to think all the time,
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.320]   do people think when I post this
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.400]   that I'm trying to be some celebrity pastor
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.020]   or when I wear this, like I just like these clothes.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.220]   Honestly, my wife picked these out.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.100]   Like I'm just trying to be this guy that I'm not.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.020]   I just, I love people and I love God's word.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.920]   That's all I'm about.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.140]   But what do people think?
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.060]   And if I let people questioning my motive rule me,
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.180]   I would do nothing.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.540]   So I'd rather get up here.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.700]   I'd rather you get out there and be obedient to God
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.680]   and potentially have some people question your motives
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.480]   than to do nothing for God at all.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.840]   Because when you let people
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.620]   and their potential misperception of you
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.380]   or their words about you or what they think of you
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.660]   dictate what you do for God, it will create paralysis.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.660]   Where instead of doing something or doing,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.340]   you just do nothing.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.180]   And you sit there and go,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.500]   well, I don't want people to think this.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.420]   One day you are gonna stand before God
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.340]   and he's gonna ask you,
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.660]   what did you do with what I gave you?
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.300]   And how sad would it be if your response was,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.740]   well, God, I really wanted to, you know, you saw me,
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.060]   but I just didn't want people to think I was being too much.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.460]   I didn't want people to think
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.660]   that I was trying to be someone I wasn't.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:57.180]   You have to know God knows your heart
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.920]   and God is putting desires and calls and purpose on your life
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.100]   for his glory.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.120]   No one else's.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.160]   The second response we see is to Saul.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.880]   Saul says, hey, you're too little.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.020]   You're too weak.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.060]   You're just a boy.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.060]   There's no way you can take this guy on.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.180]   He said, hey, Saul,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.380]   look at verse 34, but David persisted.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.620]   I have been taking care of my father's sheep and goats.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.660]   He said, when a lion or a bear comes
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.780]   to steal a land from the flock,
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.820]   I go after it with a club and rescue the land
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.820]   from its mouth.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.180]   If the animal turns on me,
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.540]   I catch it by the jaw and club it to death.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.460]   I have done this to both lions and bears,
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.020]   and I'll do it to this pagan Philistine too,
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.580]   for he has defied the armies of the living God.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.940]   The Lord who rescued me from the claws of the lion
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.540]   and the bear will rescue me from this Philistine.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.540]   He's probably like.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.760]   And Saul's like, okay,
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.660]   take some armor.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.700]   I'll let you get out there.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.460]   But why was, it says David persisted.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.580]   He's like, Saul, Saul, King, if I may,
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:02.060]   I get why, I get why you would think that looking at me,
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.580]   but here's what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.320]   When you look at me,
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.220]   don't look at the size of these arms
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.700]   or the height of this man.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.340]   Look at the size of my God and look at his power,
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.860]   but don't just look up, look back.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.500]   Look back at what he's done in my life.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.980]   When I was a shepherd boy,
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.980]   he rescued me out of the palm of lions and bears,
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.680]   and that God will rescue me today.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.060]   That was where his security was.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.620]   Your story, your opportunity to look back
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.780]   and to point people back to who God has been
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.300]   is an opportunity for you.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.860]   It's a weapon for you to remind people
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.500]   of what God wants to do now.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.380]   The lie was you can't win the battle of today.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.780]   The truth that he replaced it with is I can't, but God can,
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.220]   because the God who was faithful then will be faithful now.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.340]   You have a battle every single day.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.800]   You have a purpose and a calling
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.500]   that God wants you to walk in.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.340]   And you have an opportunity.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.160]   People are gonna say,
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.500]   are you sure you really wanna start that business?
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.620]   Are you sure you really wanna leave corporate for ministry?
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.540]   Are you really sure that you wanna give up vacation
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.220]   to go on that trip?
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.580]   That sounds crazy.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.780]   That sounds lesser than.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.900]   That's a big weight.
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.380]   That's a big challenge.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.160]   And you get to not let that decide for you or who you are.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.300]   You get to say, hey, here's the truth.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.580]   The God who's always been faithful will be faithful.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.040]   For me,
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.900]   being a husband has brought in
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.740]   a whole new level of insecurities.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.780]   When Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7,
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.180]   the married man is anxious about pleasing his wife,
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.020]   he meant it.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.580]   And that's not because of anything she's doing.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.620]   I just, there's something in me as a man that's like,
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.460]   am I doing this right?
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.700]   Is she feeling firm today?
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.100]   Am I doing all these things right?
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.260]   And then guess what?
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.140]   It's only gonna get more when I become a father.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.460]   I'm gonna be like, am I being a good husband?
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.340]   Am I being a good dad?
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.060]   Like, what, am I good at this?
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:56.900]   Am I good at this?
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.720]   Am I enough?
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.560]   Did I sign up for this?
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.400]   What am I doing?
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.620]   And then I think, I start to get insecure
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.180]   'cause I'm like, well, if I had a dad,
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.940]   if he hadn't died seven years ago,
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.160]   if I had a dad, I would still have a model
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.060]   and a person to go to to ask,
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.760]   dad, when you were my age, how did you lead mom?
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:17.820]   How did you make her feel loved?
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.340]   Or dad, when you had a newborn, how did you raise him?
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.940]   How did you make sure that he would go the right way?
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.420]   Like when you were raising me, how did you do it?
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.620]   And if I had that, then I would be good.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.860]   Then I would be secure.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.140]   But that's an unreliable source.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:33.980]   That's a lie.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.020]   Here's the truth.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.180]   Seven years without my earthly father,
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:42.260]   I have watched God take that moment
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:47.260]   and walk with me every single step of the way.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.820]   And he has provided father figure after father figure
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.260]   and men after men that I can call at the drop of a hat
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.620]   to ask questions and to be there for me.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.660]   But people, the enemy and myself want to tell me,
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.140]   hey, hey, I don't know if you can do this.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.700]   And I'm just left with like, David,
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.900]   hey, I get why you would think that.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.620]   But I can't.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.940]   But if you look, the God who's always been faithful,
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:18.300]   he will lead me as I lead her and my family.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.860]   It's the same for you.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.980]   Whatever your insecurity is,
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   and you're afraid to walk forward, look back.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.820]   Look back.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.900]   Replace the lie that makes you afraid of the future
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.320]   with the truth of the past
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.220]   and let it inform your next step.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.700]   The last one, Goliath.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.420]   Ooh, this is the one.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.460]   This one gets me hype.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.780]   We'll start to close here.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.460]   Honestly, my little clock that tells me
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.060]   if I'm going over time has been like tweaking out.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.100]   And so I have no idea how long we've been going.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.300]   So good luck guys.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.940]   So Goliath, you know, he was like,
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.500]   who's this stick?
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.280]   And David's like, stick?
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.980]   I'll show you, I'm gonna stick this rock up in your, no.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.060]   That's not what he says.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.760]   What does he say?
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.960]   Verse 45.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.540]   David replied to this nine foot giant
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.060]   covered in bronze armor.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:23.700]   "You come to me with sword, spear, and javelin,
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.880]   "but I come to you in the name
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.580]   "of the Lord of heaven's armies,
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:31.140]   "the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.280]   "Today, the Lord will conquer you
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.080]   "and I will kill you and cut off your head.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   "And then I will give the dead bodies of your men
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.060]   "to the birds and wild animals.
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.840]   "And the whole world will know
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.400]   "that there is a God in Israel.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.100]   "And everyone assembled here will know
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.040]   "that the Lord rescues his people,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.380]   "but not with sword and spear.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.380]   "This is the Lord's battle and he will give you to us."
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.600]   I mean, talk about the most epic William Wallace
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.720]   Braveheart looking speech of all time.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.740]   I read that and I'm like, let's go, I'm so pumped.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.400]   My name is John David.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.800]   I'm literally like little David, let's go.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.460]   So I just get it, I just get it.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:21.400]   The truth here is he's like, you know what, Goliath?
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.560]   Pretty much I am a stick.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.280]   Like I pretty much am just dust.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.200]   Like I'm literally made from dirt.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   But again, the God who's been faithful,
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.720]   he's the God who will claim victory today.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.360]   He's present today.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   He is the victor.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.920]   And I think, like I said earlier,
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.080]   where we get it so wrong with insecurities
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.700]   is we try self-help and we try just doing more
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.440]   and being more active and being more successful.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.120]   And we think that we are the solution to our insecurity.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.300]   That we can find security in anything else other than God.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.720]   But what David understood, what informed this moment,
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.780]   the truth that informed him,
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.340]   that when he was met with a lie,
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.520]   the truth he said is God is the victor.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:21.000]   Today and in this moment, and he is for you.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.760]   That it's God who fights my battles.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.480]   That it's God in whom I trust.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   It's God who gives me security and strength.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.160]   And you, Goliath, you put your trust
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.280]   in that weapon in your hand,
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.160]   in that armor that you're wearing.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.600]   But I don't have any of that.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.920]   I have the only true thing that will bring security.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.000]   In the face of opposition, insecurity,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.920]   giants, fear, and death,
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.040]   he says the only thing I trust is my God.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.260]   And today he will have victory.
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.300]   Now, obviously, obviously David could not see.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.720]   I'm sure he's like, and he will win.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.640]   Right, God?
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.440]   Like, okay.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.560]   That's what he's probably like.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.880]   I mean, obviously he couldn't see the end result,
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   but he was so secure in who God was.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.640]   He had heard of the God who split seas.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.840]   He had heard of the God who had already beaten
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.000]   opposing armies.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.040]   And he's like, God will fight my battle.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.760]   That is where security comes from.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.880]   And when you look and you get the right source
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.260]   to inform your beliefs of who you are,
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:48.040]   and when you understand how to differentiate
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.280]   between lies and truth,
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.840]   everything will change about who you are
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.100]   in light of who God is.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.960]   And so here's what I want you to do.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.520]   Here's where I want you to go in today,
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.280]   in your battles, in your insecurity.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.000]   Here's the place that you go to find security.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.420]   God's word, God's spirit, God's people.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:17.740]   God's word, God's spirit, God's people.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.080]   Now, remember, when you go to God's people,
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.840]   people will let you down.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.400]   People will sometimes fail you
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.840]   because they are sinful too,
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.040]   and they need grace just like you do.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.980]   And so don't just go to any person,
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.460]   go to God's person in your life
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:35.360]   who is submitted to his spirit and his word.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   That when you go to them, they don't say,
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.320]   well, here's what I would do,
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.400]   or hey, just, if that makes you happy, do it.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.360]   Go to people that will say to you,
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.800]   hey, have you prayed about it
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.000]   and sought the spirit of God to give you discernment
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.840]   to make that decision or to inform that belief in your life?
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.100]   Or two, hey, it sounds like you're insecure about that.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.900]   What does God's word say about that?
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.460]   And we'll take you to his word.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.240]   But that means that we have to know his word.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.800]   We have to be in tune with his spirit
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.580]   to be able to identify others who are as well.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.480]   That's my challenge to you, it's really simple.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   In the face of insecurity, your reliable source,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.880]   run to God's word, his spirit, and his people,
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.180]   and together with all those things,
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.120]   your surrendered heart and their commitment
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.880]   to lead you to his spirit and his people,
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.540]   you differentiate the lies and you replace them with truth.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.620]   I'll close with this.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:40.540]   Finally, my biggest insecurity, basketball.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:45.420]   Now, I don't know why, but God just chose to surround me
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.680]   by a bunch of guy friends who love basketball
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.840]   and played college basketball.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.920]   And so I was typically the guy for a long time
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.320]   that it's like, what are we gonna do today?
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.640]   And everyone's like, pick up basketball.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.200]   And I'm like, yeah, I think I gotta work on this project
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.320]   or I think I gotta go wash my fish, whatever.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.760]   And I don't know if I'm gonna make it,
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.120]   I'm just caught a stomach bug, I gotta get out of here.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.860]   And the reason why is because I was definitely suppressing
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:13.880]   this like, I like to see people do what I'm good at
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.620]   and that ain't it, keep me off the court.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.120]   And I'm like, you don't want me on the court.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.800]   And it would always be like, JD, why?
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.720]   Like, come on, man, like, it's fun, it's just for fun.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.040]   I'm like, no, you guys don't do nothing just for fun.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.400]   Trust me, I'm not gonna be the last pick
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.600]   like I was in junior high.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.120]   So I would leave and leave and leave.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.440]   And finally last summer, I had some extra time
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.360]   and I was like, you know what, enough is enough.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   I was like, it's time to get in the lab.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.900]   And you know what it took?
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.600]   I'm like, bring out the goal, I'm kidding.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.480]   But here's the thing, in order to do that,
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.840]   I had to go to a really vulnerable place.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:56.080]   Truly, it sounds so small, but I did.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.320]   I had to call my friend who played college basketball
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   and I had to say, hey, can you teach me how to play?
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.440]   He's like, yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.320]   So I'm like, okay, I don't really have shoes or anything.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.280]   I just walked up to my like ultra boost
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.000]   and you know, I get in there and he's like, okay.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.400]   And I'm this guy, you know, I'm that guy.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.280]   I just hate this, I feel really vulnerable right now.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.640]   And I'm gonna look at myself and he's like, okay.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.320]   And he was patient with me.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.360]   He's like, all right, elbow in, knees bent, just a little.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.920]   I'm like, you know, it's like a little, little much.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.200]   And he's like, catch, shoot.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.800]   And y'all know, follow through, hand in the cookie jar.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.720]   And so I'm like, okay.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.720]   So I'm like, you know, every time it's so at first,
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.560]   so mechanical, I'm like, knees bent, elbows in, catch,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.880]   shoot, follow through, you know, just like over and over.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.080]   But eventually the ball started to go in the hoop.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.920]   And I was like, I don't wanna know how to like do a layup.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.560]   I just wanna know how to make a three.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.940]   'Cause I mean, yeah, tall guys can dunk,
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.640]   but that gets you two.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.680]   I wanna get three.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.500]   (congregation applauding)
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:17.760]   And so, I mean, I'm out here daily that summer.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.480]   I had the three point line over and over and over.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.120]   And by the end of the summer, I was like, come on.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.200]   And I'm like, hey, what's everyone doing this Saturday?
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.640]   Like y'all trying to ball?
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.320]   And then I even said, yo, Jenna,
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.920]   I want you to come watch me.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.920]   That's how you know you got confidence.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.540]   And so she came, she's on the sideline.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.820]   I mean, I am ready.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.840]   And I'm thinking, bend knees, elbows in, catch,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.600]   shoot, follow through, do it.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.000]   You've worked on this, you know,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.480]   all those times of preparation.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.360]   No one saw, no one saw.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.520]   You walked with your boy.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.880]   It's time to let them see.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.220]   This is your moment.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.640]   And I get the ball.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.960]   And I mean, I am alone.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.800]   I hear, shoot it, Jay.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.040]   I shoot buckets.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.360]   I mean, buckets.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.760]   (congregation applauding)
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:17.200]   And I mean, over and over, the buckets came.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.780]   Sure, I missed some, but the point is,
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:25.400]   I got off the sideline and I got in the game
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.560]   and joy was on the other end.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.200]   Victory was on the other end.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.520]   So many of you, you're like the Israelites
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.060]   on the sidelines of life.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.720]   And there's an opponent,
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.920]   that insecurity that's holding you back.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.640]   And it's taunting you.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.580]   And you know God wants more for you.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.880]   You know that secret sin that you won't confess
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.620]   is keeping you on the sidelines of your life.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.000]   And you're insecure that you're still struggling with porn.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.200]   You've confessed it to your community for six years
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.760]   and you still went back.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.000]   No way I could lead the community group next year.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.700]   No way I could lead a Bible study.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.280]   Or man, no one's asked me out for years.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.680]   If no one wants to choose me, why would God?
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.520]   Why would God want me to do something great?
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.740]   Why would God want me in the game?
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.980]   But just like that day, I had to call my friend
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.000]   and I had to say, hey, this sounds really stupid,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.320]   but I'm really insecure about this.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.040]   I'm asking you to call the friend,
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.640]   meet with the friend tonight and say,
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.040]   this might sound dumb, but I'm really insecure about this.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.640]   And it's keeping me on the sidelines
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.680]   and I wanna get in the game.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.600]   I wanna experience the victory
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.840]   that's on the other side of vulnerability.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.240]   And if you will be vulnerable,
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.160]   if you will say it out loud, stop suppressing,
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.920]   start addressing, bring it out to your friends,
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.160]   you'll say, hey, I've been listening
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.120]   and operating out of unreliable sources.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.840]   I want your help in replacing bad practice
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.160]   and all these lies and inform them with truth
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.380]   so I can be free to get in the game.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.240]   Will you help me?
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.080]   And if you'll start to walk with them,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.800]   you'll start to see that security is not found
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.920]   in anything that you can do or change.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.000]   It's simply found by operating and being with God's people
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.880]   in the life that God has for you.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.120]   And joy, freedom, victory is on the other side
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.240]   because security is not found in ourselves.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:27.240]   Security is found in who we are in light of who he is.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.680]   And when you understand who he is,
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.000]   it'll inform everything about who you are
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.280]   and who you are not, and it will change everything.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:39.800]   But you've got to be willing to address it,
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.680]   bring it out in the light and walk with God's word,
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.960]   God's spirit and God's people.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.920]   Let's pray.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.160]   God, I thank you for this message.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.560]   Honestly, I'm feeling insecure right now
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.520]   'cause I have no idea how long I just went and you do.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.080]   And for anyone checked out,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.360]   would you bring them into this moment right here?
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.280]   Would you remind them
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.400]   that the thing that they may not even have known
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.960]   at this point 'cause they've just suppressed it
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.840]   and said they're fine for so long.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.920]   Would you remind them of what's true?
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.280]   That you love them, that you love them so much,
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.880]   that sure, David had some rocks and a sling,
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.760]   sure, Moses had a staff that split at the sea,
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.480]   sure, Gideon had the God of angel armies on his side,
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.300]   but you've given us something so much better.
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.320]   You've given us your one and only son.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.360]   And because he came down and lived a perfect life,
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.240]   and because he paid the death on the cross that we deserved,
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.400]   and he took every insecurity, every lie, every addiction,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.760]   and he hung on the cross,
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.040]   and then he didn't just leave it there,
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.840]   he buried it in the grave, but he rose again,
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.360]   and a new life victorious and conquered sin once and for all
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.500]   we now can live a new life off the sidelines
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.120]   and into freedom, into victory,
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.520]   not because of anything that we are,
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.800]   but all because of who God is, because of who you are,
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.360]   because of what your blood has purchased, and it's us.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.820]   And so for the person tonight
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.660]   who has not received the gift that is you,
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.980]   who does not feel secure in your love,
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.280]   would that change tonight?
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.800]   Would they understand that you bought them with a price
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.560]   and you're never going back, you went all in.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.280]   You love them, you cherish them, and you want them.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.740]   You want a life free in the game.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.160]   So would you help people tonight
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.120]   take a step off the sideline
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.640]   into an obedient life with you?
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.660]   May it be for your glory, in that I pray, amen.
