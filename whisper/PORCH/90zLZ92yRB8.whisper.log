[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.200]   - We did a survey a couple of weeks ago,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.640]   and thank you for all of you who filled that out
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.560]   with super valuable data to us.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.880]   Anytime you can help us know how better to connect with you
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.200]   or how better to teach or any of the topics to cover.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.160]   And one of the questions we asked was,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.800]   what topic would you most like to hear about,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.200]   or do you think is most relevant
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.760]   to the circumstances you're in?
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.260]   And it was unanimous.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.140]   There was one topic that was way ahead of all the rest.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.940]   Anyone wanna take guess what it was?
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.440]   Dating? It wasn't dating.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.980]   You'd think so.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.820]   Any other?
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.520]   Peace, okay, yeah.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.360]   It was anxiety and worry.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.700]   The topic of anxiety and worry was significantly above
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.200]   even dating and every other topic.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.880]   And so we have a very anxious group in our midst.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.440]   And so tonight we're gonna cover the topic
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.440]   of missing out on peace or anxiety and worry.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.120]   And worry, according to Webster's Dictionary,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120]   is a state of anxiety resulting from uncertainty
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.800]   over actual or potential problems.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.720]   So we probably all know this,
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.680]   but worry is I'm looking into the future
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320]   and I'm getting anxious and emotional response in me
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.200]   as I look at what may happen or what could happen,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.780]   what I fear happening.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.240]   And I have struggled with anxiety
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.200]   at different periods inside of my life.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.960]   And one of the more kind of blatant ones
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.680]   will kind of set us up for where we're going.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.040]   It was, I was preparing for my honeymoon
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.760]   and I had planned everything out.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.120]   I had picked a spot.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.280]   I was getting married and I was gonna take my then wife
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.880]   or my new wife to this really secluded,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.000]   incredible boutique resort place for eight days.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.520]   And she's all about relaxing and laying out by the beach.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.460]   And so this was gonna be great.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.600]   So I broke the bank, kind of went all in on this thing
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.380]   and got ready for this honeymoon.
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.120]   And the day before we were supposed to leave,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.560]   so we got married on a Saturday
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.720]   and we were gonna leave on a Monday.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.280]   We had a day in between.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.240]   And on that day I was hit with a nervous breakdown
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.520]   like I've never experienced in my entire life.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.240]   It hit me in a weird way that I was basically this,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.360]   what are we gonna do for the next seven days
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.160]   as I'm trapped on this secluded island?
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.720]   I barely even know this woman.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.880]   What am I doing right now and where are we going?
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.480]   And like a panic attack, like it's almost hard to describe.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.860]   It sounds hilarious.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.680]   But literally I began freaking out,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.560]   like losing short of breath.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.160]   I was going, oh my gosh, I need to find things to do there.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.080]   And it's secluded, which is great for her,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.400]   but I like to move around.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.760]   I don't rest very well.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.400]   And so I'm like freaking out.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.680]   What am I gonna do?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.520]   So I buy AT&T's international data plan
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.780]   so I could like do stuff on the site.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.760]   I went and bought 12 books as I was like,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.360]   I'll just make this an educational trip.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.200]   Here we go.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   And I just began to think of what can I possibly do?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.240]   And I know you're thinking, oh, it's your honeymoon.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.040]   I know what you're gonna do on your honeymoon.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.640]   And after 10 minutes, what are you gonna do
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.520]   the rest of the time that you're gonna do?
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.040]   Just something to think about.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.520]   And so all of this is going through my mind
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.520]   and I'm going, oh my gosh, what am I gonna do?
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   And I'm freaking out.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   And so literally I'm having to tell my new wife,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.880]   we just need to pray because I am terrified
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.600]   of being trapped on an island with you
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.720]   and I don't know what to do,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.480]   which of course makes every woman really happy to hear.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.360]   And so all of this is kind of going on inside of my heart.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.000]   And as crazy as that sounds, like it sounds ludicrous,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.340]   even explaining, and the trip was great and it was awesome.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.720]   And all of that disappeared once we had gotten there.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.600]   But as insane as that sounds,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.760]   like why would you worry about that?
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.680]   The funny thing about worry is all worry is really insane.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.780]   Like it's irrational at some level.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.340]   And here's what I mean by that.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.160]   Like worry, it does not ever help the situation.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.280]   In fact, let's just start this way.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.040]   Has worrying about something,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.080]   if you've ever worried about anything,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.780]   has worrying ever positively contributed
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.520]   to the things that you worry about?
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.060]   Like is worrying about what's gonna happen
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.980]   the next day on that job,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.660]   what's gonna happen in this relationship,
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.860]   will we go and get married, what's gonna happen,
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.240]   does worrying ever help?
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.360]   No.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   Like it always makes things generally worse.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.660]   It takes up our mind, our focus, we're distracted.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.140]   It never, in no situation, helps.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.940]   And it wastes not only our emotional time,
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.480]   it wastes our time.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.240]   And time, or life, equals time.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.860]   And so you run out of time, you run out of life.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.860]   Worry, in no circumstances,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.880]   it adds positively to any situation.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.300]   And so really, I mean, what we thought was
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.480]   we would give you two words in light of this,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.440]   that worry never provides any benefit,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.800]   and how it makes no sense in any situation.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.960]   And so you might wanna write these down
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.020]   if you take notes straight from scripture.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.040]   Here they are.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.820]   In conclusion, stop it.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.660]   Stop worrying.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.780]   Let's close in prayer.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.920]   I mean, it should be like that simple, shouldn't it?
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.060]   It makes no sense in any situation,
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.200]   it never adds to life, it only takes from a life,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.940]   so why would we worry?
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.220]   And the funny thing, in addition to that about worry,
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.660]   is that knowing that being anxious,
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.820]   or knowing that worrying doesn't help,
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.440]   doesn't help.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.240]   Like knowing that, hey, worrying is not helpful,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.100]   well, you telling me worrying is not helpful,
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.280]   is not helpful, I still am worried.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.800]   Trying to stop worry is like trying to fall asleep at night.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.100]   It's like, I'm trying to stop, I just can't.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.880]   I'm trying to sleep, I can't fall asleep.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.900]   And so what do we do?
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.080]   And really, this isn't just a problem that relates to us.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.680]   According to recent data, the United States as a whole
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.800]   would take home, if anxiety and worry was an Olympic sport,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.280]   the gold medal every single year.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.920]   We are a nation of worry warts off the charts.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.400]   Unlike no other country, even in the West,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.360]   America struggles with anxiety.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   Here's some stuff from the American Psychological Association
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.200]   where it says one third of Americans
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.880]   will have an anxiety disorder within their lifetime.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.680]   40 million right now have an anxiety disorder.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.560]   It is the most common mental disorder in America.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.200]   50% of that 40 million is between the ages of 17 and 34,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.360]   so the ages of most of us in this room.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.560]   There's something about our country
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.860]   where it is like the land of the free
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.540]   and home of the anxious,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.360]   where we are a worried, anxiety-filled people.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.300]   And despite we know the fact that it doesn't help,
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.480]   like worrying, it's not gonna really add,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.240]   even knowing that, we can't get rid of our worry.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.560]   52% of millennials, which is young adult, 20s and 30s,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.880]   have, according to American Psychological Association,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.000]   laying awake in the past month due to stress
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.480]   and anxiety, they couldn't fall asleep or lost sleep.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   76% admit to experiencing significant amounts of anxiety
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.840]   due to future economic worries.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.520]   And so tonight, we're gonna tackle this topic
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.440]   of finding freedom from anxiety.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.600]   And the good news is, is that Jesus,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.800]   who is called the Prince of Peace, think about that.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.760]   The Prince of Peace, standing on a hillside one day,
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.520]   addressed the crowd that much like our nation,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.360]   struggled with worry and with anxiety.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.320]   And inside of the verses we're about to read,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.080]   I promise you, if you struggle with anxiety,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.680]   there is a truth and there is something that Jesus says,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.920]   "I want to invite you out of that anxiety,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.160]   "and if you will listen and you will apply,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.560]   "you will find freedom from that."
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.600]   So we're gonna learn from the Prince of Peace
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.720]   on how to experience peace,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.200]   or experience freedom from our anxiety.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.800]   We're gonna be in Matthew chapter six.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.240]   If you have a Bible, you can open up to Matthew chapter six.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.280]   Should be somewhat near halfway of your Bible.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.000]   If you hit Psalms, keep going right.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.320]   And then you hit Matthew, if you hit Mark, Luke, John,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.600]   or any other books, turn back to Matthew.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.560]   We'll be in chapter six.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.720]   This is the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.920]   Without a question, Jesus' most famous teaching.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.720]   And we're gonna be picking it up in verse 24.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.160]   Here we go.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.760]   "No one," Jesus speaking.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.840]   So he looks out into this audience
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.400]   and he starts with an illustration.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.960]   "No one can serve two masters.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.480]   "Either you will hate the one and love the other,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.320]   "or you will be devoted to one and despise the other."
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.920]   So Jesus starts saying, "Just like a servant
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.560]   "can't serve two masters."
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.320]   A servant has one master that they are devoted to.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.600]   In the same way, so let me use this illustration,
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.000]   Jesus would say, to bridge how this works.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.640]   Jesus would say, to bridge how this relates to you.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   You cannot serve or be a servant of both God and money.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.160]   And the little word money,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.860]   it's really not a great translation.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.640]   It's the word mammon.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.880]   And if you have a study Bible,
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.560]   it may even have a footnote that says mammon.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.000]   And mammon was a personification of accumulation,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.920]   which sounds funny.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.760]   It was basically a word in this culture
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.120]   which just meant the God of accumulating, of getting stuff.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.460]   Jesus says, "You can't serve both God's kingdom
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.120]   "and your kingdom."
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.660]   At the end of the day, you can seek after both at some level
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.300]   but you're going to have to make a decision.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.520]   Ultimately, who is your master?
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.520]   You cannot serve both God and his kingdom and your kingdom.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.060]   And so he uses this as a launching point
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.580]   into how depending on whose kingdom you serve
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.380]   will determine the anxiety you experience.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.800]   Here's what he says, verse 25.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.220]   "Therefore," in light of that,
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.100]   in light of the fact that you can't serve both,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.820]   "and as followers of Christ, you are to serve God's kingdom.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.820]   "Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life."
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.020]   Which on the surface seems like very unhelpful.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.700]   Jesus, you tell me not to worry.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.300]   No one wants to worry.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.120]   Don't worry.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.480]   Have you ever had someone who was around you
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.220]   and they just are kind of like the happy-go-lucky
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.620]   and they're like, just don't worry about it.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.780]   And like, yeah, thank you.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.820]   That's really helpful.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.700]   If you could call me every hour
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.020]   and just say, don't worry about it,
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.420]   that would really help me.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.820]   No, it doesn't help at all.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.700]   And so Jesus, he's going somewhere.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.660]   And so it's not just don't worry.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.820]   But he says, I want you to do something else.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.660]   Here we go.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.180]   What you will eat, so don't worry about your life,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.220]   including what you will eat or what you will drink
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.380]   or about your body, what you will wear.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.340]   So he connects with the things his audience is worried about.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.180]   In our context, it would look more like this.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.680]   Don't worry about being married by 30.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.180]   Don't worry about what other people think about you.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.100]   Don't worry about whether the economy is gonna crumble.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.780]   Don't worry, am I in the right job?
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.580]   Don't worry, who am I gonna live with
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.860]   if my roommates move out and they all get married?
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.460]   Don't worry about your biological clock
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.540]   and it's ticking away.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.700]   And am I gonna find someone?
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.020]   Don't worry about whether or not the person you're dating
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.660]   is gonna sit next to someone cute in their cube at work.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.940]   Don't worry, he would say,
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.220]   to all of the things that we worry about.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.180]   And he's not saying don't worry
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.500]   because they're not important.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.820]   In fact, he's gonna make the opposite case in a second.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.100]   And he's not saying don't care.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.100]   He is saying, I want you to know
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.660]   there is a way to face uncertainty
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.380]   and to not worry about it.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.140]   And I am inviting you to step into a place
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.540]   where you are free from worry.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.440]   He continues.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.260]   Is not life more important than food
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.880]   and the body more important than clothes?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.140]   And so the word important,
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.240]   here's what's interesting about this,
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.500]   is really not in the original text.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.860]   In fact, depending on your translation,
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.820]   you may not have important.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.820]   It's is not life more than food or more than clothes?
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.900]   And what he's trying to do, and this is so brilliant,
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.960]   Jesus was such a brilliant teacher,
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.980]   is he's trying to pull his audience back
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.380]   from the things that they worry about
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.100]   that they get so hyper-focused on it becomes consuming.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.420]   That's all I can think about.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.040]   And so he goes, look, is life not more than just food?
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   Is it not more than clothes?
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.380]   For us, he would say, is it not more than being married?
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.180]   Like, does marriage equal life?
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.160]   Does having a kid equal life?
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.920]   Does the opinion of that person equal life?
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.960]   Does food, if you stacked all those things up,
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.240]   would you go, yeah, that's life.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.080]   That's all that there is.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.560]   I would never have any other cares.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.000]   And we go, no, no, those don't equal life.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.320]   Jesus is going, exactly.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.420]   But they get all of your focus and all of your attention
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.700]   and are taking up your life.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.580]   And it's, in a brilliant way, it pulls us back
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.960]   because here's what worry further does.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.620]   It paralyzes us to where we never chase down
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.620]   the things we're worried about.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.940]   I don't know how to explain this very well.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.820]   It forces us, or it makes us like so focused
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.500]   on what if I don't get that job
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.080]   that all I think about is that job
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.840]   and I never chase down the end result of that fear.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.080]   What if you don't get that job?
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.000]   Well, then I wouldn't have a job.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.800]   And then what would happen?
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.720]   Well, I guess I'd have to look for another job.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.000]   Okay, well, then what would happen?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.800]   What if I didn't find another job?
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.720]   Well, then what would happen?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.640]   Well, I guess I'd have to figure out
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.600]   what I would do monetarily.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.920]   Well, then what would happen?
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   What if I never get married?
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.400]   What if I stay single for the rest of my life?
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.120]   Well, then what would happen?
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.160]   Well, I'd be single for the rest of my life.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.840]   And then what would happen?
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.340]   I guess I'd die single and go to be with Jesus.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.400]   Okay, and then what would happen?
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.240]   Well, I'd be with them forever and ever and ever.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.120]   We never chase down.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.620]   So Jesus is trying to pull them back
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.220]   and say the things you worry about
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.520]   that are consuming your life,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.640]   they're not as big as the worry
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.320]   you're experiencing makes them.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.520]   And so I wanna pull you back,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.360]   not that they're not important,
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.400]   but that life consists of more than that.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.240]   He continues.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.280]   And he's outside and so he looks up
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.880]   and he sees birds fly by and he goes,
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.360]   look at the birds of the air.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.680]   They do not sow or reap or store away in barns
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   all things his audience did.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.000]   So they're worried about food and he's going,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.280]   look at the birds of the air.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.480]   And this isn't like Bob Marley Jesus being like,
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.900]   just don't worry, look at the birds, man.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.800]   This is Jesus and he's really, I promise you,
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.520]   he's trying to help them.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.960]   And he says, look, you guys,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.000]   you reap and you store away in barns,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.240]   look at the birds, they don't do anything like that.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.920]   So as he would say, look,
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.560]   you don't need to worry about whether or not
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.680]   you get married or whether or not
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.120]   you're gonna have a job.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.600]   Birds don't do anything like that.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.500]   They don't save up, they don't have a 401k.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.680]   They don't go to christianmingle.com.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.640]   They don't do any of the things that you do.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.800]   The birds, God provides for them
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.640]   and they don't even really try.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.120]   They're not responsible like you.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.780]   They just fly around and are like,
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.400]   I think we should fly south.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.080]   This feels so familiar.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.880]   And then they look at another bird to mate.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.120]   Like the birds of the air, Jesus's point is,
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.200]   they don't even really try in the way that you do.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.160]   They don't store or reap.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.440]   And yet your heavenly father feeds them.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.840]   Jesus says, let me ask you a question.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:44.440]   Are you not much more valuable or valuable to God than they?
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:55.080]   Do you think that the God who cares for the birds of the air
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.880]   could care about them more than he cares for you?
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.760]   Do you think, I know this is a hard question
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.500]   and maybe you've grown up with animal lovers
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.960]   who put their dogs in sweaters,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.340]   but do you think that the God of the universe
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.340]   cares more, Jesus says, for a bird than he does for you?
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.680]   When it came to man, when he created all kinds of cool stuff
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.040]   he created the birds, he created all of creation
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.600]   and plants and animals and all that stuff.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.160]   But when he came to man, he said,
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.080]   there's something different about this one.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.640]   This one alone is in my image.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.600]   I'm gonna send my own son to die.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.280]   And he didn't send him in the image of a bird.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.380]   He sent him in the form of a man to die on a cross.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.880]   Do you think that the God who's there cares more
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.780]   for birds who he provides for than you?
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.080]   And then he continues.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.800]   In case you're thinking, it's almost like he responds
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.120]   to a reaction in his audience who are like, great,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.640]   this bird thing is not helping, I'm anxious,
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.920]   I got bills to pay.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.520]   And he responds by going, okay, in case I'm losing you,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.280]   who of you, verse 27, by worrying
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.520]   can add a single hour to your life?
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.160]   Okay, so you don't like the bird thing?
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.720]   Let me ask you this.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.320]   Does worrying help?
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.960]   Like, can you add life onto, or can you extend your life
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.260]   through worrying about something?
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.880]   To which we would all say no.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.480]   In fact, science has now come out and said
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.040]   that worrying not only doesn't add to it,
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.360]   it takes away time off of our life.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.200]   It is as struggling with anxiety,
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.400]   according to psychologists and medical professionals,
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.920]   is as dangerous as struggling with smoking.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.240]   They take and can have the same effect on someone's body.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.080]   Then anxiety doesn't add, it only takes away.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.640]   And so Jesus says, if you don't like that,
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.760]   look, I'm telling you, I want you to be free from worry
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.960]   and it's not gonna help you.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.040]   And so he continues, giving us a second illustration.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.880]   Verse 28, and why don't you worry about clothes?
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.840]   And why do you worry about clothes?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.120]   See how the lilies of the field grow.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.420]   They do not labor or spin, which they did, in his audience.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.360]   Yet I tell you that not even Solomon
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.940]   in all of his splendor was dressed like one of these.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.000]   If that is how God clothes the grass of the field,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.360]   which is here today and tomorrow is thrown in the fire,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.080]   will he not much more clothe you?
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.960]   Oh, you of little faith.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.520]   And he introduces this idea that there is a relationship
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.500]   between the size of your faith and the size of your worry,
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.120]   that there is a relationship.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.760]   And if you struggle with anxiety,
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.820]   you need to know, and it sounds almost offensive, Jesus,
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.860]   that there is a relationship
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.760]   between the size of your faith and the size of your worry.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.460]   It says, oh, you of little faith.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.980]   The phrase, oh, you of little faith, is so interesting
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.700]   because it's the only place,
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.740]   it's the only time we see Jesus, this word used.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.640]   It's used only by Jesus.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.260]   It's as though he made up the word.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.560]   It's like a compound word.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.740]   He takes little and faith and he puts them together.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.900]   It's like loud talker or close talker.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.740]   It's like a made up word,
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.060]   but it kind of describes what we're going for.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.220]   This is what Jesus does here.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.260]   And he takes these two words and he says,
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.480]   you're a little faither.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.520]   That's what you are.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.820]   You're a little faither.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.660]   You think that God created everything that is.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.480]   He created the birds and he feeds them.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.140]   He put the stars and he hung them in place.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.740]   You think that God made everything
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.920]   and he controls all that is and he's loving.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.200]   And yet he's not in control of your circumstances.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.300]   You're a little faither, he says.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.000]   And he's trying to help them identify
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.180]   that there is a relationship between the size of our faith
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.100]   and the size of our worry.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.500]   And it's as though he says, let me make it further clear.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.680]   So do not worry, saying what shall we eat
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.500]   and what shall we drink or what shall we wear
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.100]   for the pagans, the pagans,
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.140]   any pagans here in the room tonight?
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.980]   I'm kidding.
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.380]   Pagans was a word of a person who did not know God,
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.660]   a person who did not believe they had a heavenly father,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.820]   a person who believed in a foreign God or no God at all.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.680]   And he says, this is what pagans do.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.820]   They run after all these things
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.440]   and your heavenly father knows that you need them.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:35.020]   That he says, there are people who act
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.460]   as though they don't have anyone to watch their back
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.020]   and they're called pagans.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.220]   They run after all those things.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.900]   They should worry about those things, but you are different.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.180]   You have a heavenly father who loves you,
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.180]   who is in control, who has promised to work all things
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.020]   for your good.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.700]   And he says, look, don't let worry,
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.380]   which is a pagan thing to do.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.400]   It is a pagan sport.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.500]   Worry is not meant to mark the lives of believers.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.960]   He says, don't let anxiety back you
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.780]   into the same self-centered, self-focused life
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.260]   that all the rest of humanity runs into.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.040]   You have a heavenly father who knows what you need,
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.560]   who loves you, who is in control of all things.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.000]   And he says, look, anxiety, if you let it,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.280]   will back you into a self-centered corner
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.040]   where only people who don't have someone
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.880]   watching their back belong.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.400]   And he wants you to be free from that,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.480]   that you have been invited and I've been invited
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.600]   to release our worry and to experience freedom.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.820]   And he's about to give us the verse
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.520]   on really how this takes place.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   And I think this is so huge.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.600]   And if you struggle with anxiety, I really feel for you
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.840]   'cause I can relate on a number of levels.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.900]   Anxiety, unlike other struggles,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.160]   is not something any of us want.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.760]   Like if you look at porn, there's an element
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.160]   where you're like, I kinda wanna look at porn.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.040]   If you struggle with materialism, you're like,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.380]   yeah, I just wanted this purse, I wanted these whatever.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.040]   But no one wants to be anxious.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.700]   And God loves you and he's provided a way
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.400]   and he offers a solution to it.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.000]   And it's in this next verse and it's a verse
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.480]   that you've probably heard so many times
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.960]   that it no longer has the same effect on you.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.420]   But here it is in verse 31.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.200]   Here is the solution.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:27.320]   But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.700]   and all of these things will be given to you as well.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.040]   So seek first.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.400]   And here's I think what people,
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.360]   when you struggle with anxiety,
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.600]   and often we teach it this way so it's wrong.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.000]   It's hey, don't worry, just go on a mission trip.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.680]   Don't worry, go share your faith.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.640]   Don't worry, be seeking his kingdom first.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   This first, the word seek, is more closely resembling
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.680]   to surrender first.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.720]   In other words, when it comes to whose kingdom
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.880]   is going to be the first focus,
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.520]   the thing that I'm devoted to,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.720]   God says, here's how you do it.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   I want you to seek first or embrace first my kingdom
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.080]   above your kingdom.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.360]   I want when it comes for the competition
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.400]   of what's going to be in first place,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.080]   whose kingdom is gonna be in first place,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.720]   I want you to not let it be a competition
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.820]   and place my kingdom, God says, in first place.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.720]   My agenda, my will for your life.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.940]   And whose kingdom competes for God's kingdom?
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.340]   In my life, it's mine.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.840]   The things that I worry about are fueled
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   by me putting my agenda or my kingdom first.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.880]   The things that I worry about are all about
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.800]   I want this to be this way.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.840]   I want to be married X time.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.600]   I want to have this amount of money and savings.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.480]   I want to have security if the economy crumbles.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.760]   And he says, look, if you want to experience freedom,
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.160]   it begins by surrendering first place
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.760]   whose kingdom you're gonna serve.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.360]   You cannot serve both God and your kingdom.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.480]   And so it begins by seeking first
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.480]   or embracing first his kingdom above your kingdom.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   I think this is what I wrote in my notes
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.720]   is it looks like this, God, I want to be married.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.560]   And you know how desperately I want to be married
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.900]   or I want to have a job.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.780]   Or you know how much I'm afraid
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.520]   of what my boss thinks about me.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.340]   But your kingdom before my kingdom, I'm trusting you.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.080]   If it doesn't work out, I'm trusting
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.240]   as your will unfolds, your will before my will.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.120]   He brings us back to something, honestly,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.220]   that he said like 20 verses before
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.140]   with the same two words, he just said it.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.080]   And then he gives us this again.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.920]   Here's what he says.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.980]   This is in Matthew six, verse nine and 10.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.920]   This then is how you should pray.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.560]   Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.380]   or holy is your name.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.440]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.200]   That's my earth, that's where I live.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   That's my life.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.720]   Your will be done in my life as it is in heaven.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.200]   Your kingdom come in front of mine.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.560]   God says the remedy, if you want to experience
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.040]   and step into the direction of peace
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.520]   is by saying your kingdom before mine,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.280]   your will before mine.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.200]   God, you know how desperately I want this,
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   but I'm trusting you, your kingdom, your will.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.300]   You love me and you control everything.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.260]   And so even though my circumstances,
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.260]   I wouldn't work them out this way,
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.380]   I'm gonna trust you.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.780]   Your kingdom comes before mine.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:55.200]   I wrote down that, God, you know my roommate is moving out.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.580]   I've done everything that I can.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.040]   I don't know where I'm going to live,
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.180]   but I'm surrendering to you.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:05.180]   I'm trusting you, your kingdom, your will before my will.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.500]   You know how little I have in savings,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.020]   and if I don't get this job, I'm trusting you,
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.620]   your kingdom, this is not how my kingdom
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.500]   would have done things, but yours before mine.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.440]   This like totally changed my perspective
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.580]   on worry and anxiety.
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.980]   And I think one of the reasons it did
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.860]   is because when you struggle with worry,
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.660]   you get caught in like, I don't know what else to do.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.380]   I just get used to like panicking,
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.900]   or I just get used to getting worried.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.540]   And it gives us an alternative.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.500]   Jesus says, I want to invite you to an alternative response
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.260]   to experience freedom from that.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.620]   And it really did.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.460]   Like we are moving towards a season
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.260]   where we want to start trying at some point,
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.100]   or we want to have kids.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.260]   We hope to have a family someday, my wife and I.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:58.420]   And I have this weird fear that like we won't be able to.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.540]   And it's unfounded at this level right now at least.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.260]   But I have this like fear in the back of my head
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.500]   that what if we can't?
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.940]   And my temptation will be to like tailspin,
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.260]   oh my gosh, what if we couldn't,
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.620]   and think about it and worry about it
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.820]   and try to take control.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.460]   And it's realizing this, that I'm able to go,
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.700]   I wouldn't have done it that way, God.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.500]   And if we can't, I'm choosing to trust you.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.320]   I know you love me.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.240]   I know you control everything.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   So help me to trust you and your will be done in my life
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.880]   before my will.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.340]   Even though that's not what I would want.
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.080]   Your kingdom comes before mine,
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.800]   and it gives me a peace 'cause I can let it go.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.360]   And trust or hold on and attempt to trust
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.040]   the God who loves me and who loves you.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.560]   And I think where most of us get stuck is we go,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.280]   look, if I just open my hand
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.000]   and I stop gripping onto the wheel and not taking control,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.920]   what if things don't work out the way I want them to?
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.040]   What if I don't get married
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.680]   and I'm the 50-year-old cat lady?
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.080]   What if I never have a job?
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.120]   What if I end up being homeless?
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.480]   What about, what about, what about?
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.880]   And the reality is,
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.280]   what do you think's happening right now anyways?
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.360]   Like you have no control.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.420]   Control is an illusion.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.560]   There's no opening your hands, there's no alternative.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.960]   You can either be worried
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.780]   and experience the illusion of worry,
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.000]   or you can trust the only one who's ever been in control,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.400]   the prince of peace,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.240]   and surrender, and trust him.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.560]   And you know what's good about that?
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.920]   He loves you more than you love yourself.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.240]   He's way more in control than you have ever been
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.360]   or ever will be.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.940]   He loves you enough to die for you,
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.960]   and he's saying, look, I'm inviting you.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.240]   And if you have anxiety in the room,
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.940]   I know the temptation is to go, you don't know my story,
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.160]   you don't know what it's about,
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.560]   and I promise you, the prince of peace
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.160]   is offering you a first step into finding freedom
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.640]   from worry and anxiety.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.520]   And it comes by handing over the control
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.240]   that's been his all along,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.440]   and saying, God, I trust you.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.960]   I trust you.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.240]   Will you help me trust you?
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.000]   And your will be done in every arena of my life,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.860]   before my will.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.720]   He closes with this, verse 34.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.960]   Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.000]   for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.080]   So do all you can today, and then trust him with tomorrow.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.200]   I'm gonna do all that I can today,
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.360]   and I'm gonna trust you with tomorrow.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.640]   There's a famous pastor in the 1930s
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.240]   who really, in light of this verse,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.440]   said, God is inviting us to not put our confidence
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.840]   in what tomorrow holds,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.720]   but in the one who holds tomorrow.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.100]   God is inviting us to not put our confidence,
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.600]   or our faith in what tomorrow holds,
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.800]   or what we think it may,
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.960]   but in the one who holds tomorrow, who loves you,
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.400]   and is inviting you to trust him,
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.300]   and your kingdom may not unfold the way you want it to,
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.120]   but it's gonna happen anyways.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.600]   And he's saying, my kingdom, my agenda,
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.480]   is better than what your agenda and your will.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.560]   Will you trust me, and experience freedom from worry?
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:41.360]   Jesus is not only just the perfect teacher
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.320]   of just an example of experiencing overwhelming circumstances
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.080]   and looking out in the future and facing uncertainty,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.440]   but he's the perfect, he walked through it perfectly,
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.600]   and really models out what it looks like to live this way.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   He does this in Mark 14, verse 34, where he says this.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.560]   "My soul," this is Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.440]   so he's in just incredibly dramatic circumstances,
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.080]   hours away from his death, and he's looking out,
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.000]   and he does exactly what we're talking about,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.560]   where he says, I don't like what I'm facing,
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.760]   but I'm gonna choose to trust you.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.060]   Here's what happens, verse 34.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.680]   "My soul," Jesus speaking,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.080]   "is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.040]   "Going a little farther, he fell to the ground,
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.800]   "and he prayed," and listen to his prayer,
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.880]   "if possible, this hour might pass from him.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   "'Abba, Father,' he said, 'everything is possible for you.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.580]   "'Take this cup from me.'
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.820]   "So I don't like this.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.520]   "Father, will you change these circumstances?
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:45.520]   "But not my will, but your will be done."
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.600]   Not mine, yours.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.000]   Your kingdom come in my life, in my earth,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.960]   in my surroundings, as it is in heaven.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.360]   Your will be done.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:03.720]   A couple years ago, we taught on this topic very similarly,
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   and afterwards, a 22-year-old kid came down front.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.360]   He was really young.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.680]   No, he was 21 at the time.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.280]   And we just taught this exact passage,
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.920]   and he came down and he said,
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.160]   he was really kind, he said, "Thank you."
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.120]   It really helped, and he began to explain
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   he had a brain tumor, and it was really uncertain
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.040]   what was ahead for him.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.880]   As small as three to six months to who knows,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.040]   and he said he'd been wrestling with just such anxiety.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.840]   He drove in five hours because he had heard
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.040]   that they were covering anxiety,
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.720]   or anxiety was a topic we're gonna talk about
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.840]   in a little bit, but he was so anxious.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.080]   It was a topic we're gonna talk about,
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.400]   which is kind of like, man, you should've
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.440]   just watched the podcast, but he did it,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.680]   and he came in, and he just began to say,
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.000]   man, that thank you, and the next week,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.680]   he sent an email in, and in it, he just said,
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.020]   look, I was so wrestling with what my future held,
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.400]   and that night, I got on my knees,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.200]   and I just prayed, God, your kingdom, I don't wanna die.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.360]   'Cause your kingdom comes before mine.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   Your will be done, and my kingdom,
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.720]   that's not what I would do.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.560]   Will you change my circumstances?
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.180]   But if you don't, your will before mine.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.800]   And I remember reading that and going, oh my gosh.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.520]   I wanna have faith like that.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.720]   I wanna have faith that takes that step,
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.480]   says God, I'm trusting you.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.340]   I'm choosing to trust that you love me, you're for me.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.400]   I can't even understand how this could be the better kingdom
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.480]   but your will be done in my life and my world.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:54.860]   There is a faith that overtakes fear.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:00.400]   Fear is powerful, and the only thing,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.720]   or the two things that Scripture defines
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.800]   or describes as more powerful than fear,
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.160]   I mean, people do all kinds of things.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.500]   I was afraid that drives them to do all kinds of things.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.660]   And the Scripture tells us there's two things.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.800]   Perfect love is more powerful than fear.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.660]   Perfect love displayed by God himself on a cross for you,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.100]   and if you will let him, will drive that fear
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.540]   and wants to drive that from your life.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.380]   And the second thing is this, faith.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.180]   There is a faith that God wants you to experience
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.720]   and me to experience that overtakes fear.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.060]   And he's inviting you and calling you out to that.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.200]   And the first step is surrendering.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.260]   God, your agenda before my agenda.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.280]   I can be worried, and if you're worried,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.820]   your worries tell you the things in your kingdom
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.600]   that you're afraid of losing.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.720]   And he's saying, I'm inviting you
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.720]   to experience a life free from anxiety, free from worry.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.860]   And there is a faith that if you will begin to trust me
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.500]   day by day, one day at a time,
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.080]   there is a faith that overtakes all fear.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.060]   And I want you to experience it.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:23.100]   I'm gonna pray that God would allow us to tonight,
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.420]   if we're wrestling with anxiety,
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.560]   and we'd love to talk to you about it,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.160]   experience a peace from the Prince of Peace from that fear.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   Father, we believe by faith that you love us.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.900]   We believe by faith that you are in control,
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.580]   regardless of whether our circumstances indicate that,
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.140]   regardless of whether our kingdom
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.520]   is unfolding the way we hoped it would be.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.760]   Would you in your grace allow us to experience
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.280]   a faith that overtakes the fear in our life?
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.340]   The most common command you give us is fear not.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.740]   More than anything else, you invite us to fear not.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.860]   For those of us who struggle with anxiety,
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.000]   would you call us out into that faith?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.020]   Where your fear, or where our fears are driven away.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.060]   We love you and we need your help, Lord.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.900]   We believe in you, but we need your help
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.900]   to believe you more, and so would you give us that
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.860]   in your grace tonight, amen.
