[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   [dramatic music]
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:26.660]   >> All right, let's go.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.060]   Welcome everybody in the room.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.960]   Tuning in at all of our locations,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.660]   everybody that's here.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.180]   And I want to welcome a handful
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.940]   or a few of our Porch Live locations
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.100]   out of the 12, Porch North Houston,
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.860]   Porch Houston, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Austin, Texas,
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.700]   and all the locations and everybody online.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.380]   We are wrapping up this series on scandals.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.860]   We have been looking at sinners that led to the Savior,
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.900]   the men and women who made up the family tree of Jesus.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.460]   And tonight we're going to look at the setup
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.900]   upon which the Savior arrived into the world.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.980]   And Matthew's account,
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.940]   which really comes right after he walks through,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.620]   hey, this is the family of Jesus
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.300]   and this is the birth of Jesus.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.340]   And so in order to do that,
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.660]   let me start with a story that'll give us
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.900]   a little bit of tracks for where we're going.
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.020]   In 2015, my wife and I found out
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.180]   we were pregnant with our first child,
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.960]   our son, his name is Crew.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.060]   We're stoked.
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.080]   And at that time we were living in a rental property
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.500]   and we were trying to figure out,
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.360]   hey, is this going to be where we end up,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.340]   you know, making a home
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.900]   and the baby nursery,
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.200]   or are we going to buy a house
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.260]   because we've been in the market looking for a house.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.700]   And we looked and looked and hadn't been successful.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.220]   My wife was six months pregnant
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.700]   and somebody lists online a foreclosure property
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.040]   that was so bad,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.660]   no one could possibly have lived inside of it.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.340]   I mean, we'd assumed there were dead bodies
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.240]   in the wall or something,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.620]   but it was one of those scenarios
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.620]   like I've talked about before,
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.700]   where you want to look for the house
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.540]   that nobody else wants.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.080]   And so I was like, babe, I got our house.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.920]   We go and see it.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.700]   She's like, this looks like there's dead bodies
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.280]   in the wall or something.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.440]   And we ended up buying the house
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.820]   and beginning to renovate it.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.920]   Now the problem was we started renovations
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.580]   and it needed a lot of renovations.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.620]   Like it was not livable.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.460]   There wasn't electricity.
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.820]   It was not a livable place.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.180]   And we started renovating it October 1st
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.700]   and we had a baby coming December 19th.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.120]   Now I don't know if you can do math,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.620]   but that's not a lot of time.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.020]   I don't know, math's not my strong suit.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.860]   So maybe you're right there with me,
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.980]   but that was two months of time that we had.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.100]   And we had to do an entire renovation.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.660]   And so the contractors and they're working through it
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.500]   and they're working on it.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.260]   And it gets to the point where we're like, man,
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.180]   I think we're going to get there.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180]   And a month goes by and they made a lot of progress,
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.020]   but there's like still no drywall on the walls
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.580]   and the floors weren't done.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.180]   And another week goes by and another week goes by.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.040]   And come to find out, we had a week left.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.940]   It was December 8th.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.600]   And we had essentially another 11 days
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.300]   until our son was supposed to be born on December 19th.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.300]   And they were supposed to finish on December 12th.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.060]   And so it was like, man, this is gonna be perfect, dude.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.740]   I'm dad of the year, husband of the year.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.140]   I just got you a house, mom.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.580]   And my wife calls me and it's December 8th
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.820]   and we're setting up for the Porch Christmas Concert in 2015
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.080]   and she says, you need to come home right now
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.820]   because the doctor said I'm having an emergency C-section
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.100]   because the baby is basically his head was too enormous
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.340]   and he needed to get out of there.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.440]   True story.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.100]   And I go home and the next morning we go in,
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.740]   we have a C-section, have our son.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.860]   Here's a picture of crew from that time,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.440]   happy as can be.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.600]   I know, man, smiling.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.700]   He's like three hours old at this point.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.840]   He's just loving life.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.040]   And it was awesome.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.460]   And we spent the next three days at the hospital
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.140]   'cause that's what you do after you have a baby.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.620]   And if you play out the math,
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.260]   remember the house was supposed to be done on December 12th.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.720]   And we were in the hospital on December 9th.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.320]   And so our expectation of we're gonna finish it,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.560]   we're gonna set up the nursery,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.160]   I had like promised, we're gonna have tons of time,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.060]   we'll set the nursery up, it'll all be great.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.160]   None of that happened.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.760]   And we leave the hospital and go to an entirely empty house
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.320]   with all of our furniture inside of the garage
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.280]   and try to set up a crib and try to set up,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.920]   just throw a mattress on the ground.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.480]   And we go in and everything that I had hoped and expected
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.760]   and wanted for kind of this setup of our child entering
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.740]   didn't go to plan.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.120]   Now, what does that have to do with tonight?
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.100]   Well, we're gonna look at the story
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.240]   in the entrance of Jesus,
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.440]   and you may be somewhat familiar with it,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.120]   but it is certainly without,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.920]   goes without saying a scenario where the birth of a child
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.880]   did not go to plan.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.160]   Certainly to the plans of the mother and father
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.440]   in that scenario.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.260]   And I wanna walk through the scandals that made up
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.240]   the arrival of the savior of the world,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   because you may have heard the Christmas story,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.460]   you're familiar with it.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.900]   But when you look at the account that Matthew gives us,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.800]   unique from the account that Luke gives us,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.560]   Luke gives us the account that you probably heard
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.840]   and Charlie Brown reads every single year on TV
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.320]   and you know, has the nativity of there were angels
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.760]   in the field that day and behold, a great light came up
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.080]   and Mary pondered all these things in her heart.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.280]   Matthew's account is full of scandal after scandal
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.840]   from an unplanned pregnancy
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.840]   to an attempted breaking off engagement to a genocide
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.800]   to these foreign mystics showing up, random strangers.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.060]   And Matthew shows us the scandals that led
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.340]   to the savior of the world.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.820]   And more importantly, in looking at these scandals,
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.300]   we learned something about God
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.460]   and how we are to come to him.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.100]   And we learned something about how God has come
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.660]   to every person here.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.940]   And finally, we see that God is at work
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.800]   despite what you see.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.180]   So I wanna walk through and I'm gonna trace
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.100]   these three scandals and each has a truth
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.140]   that corresponds with it.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.460]   We're gonna be in Matthew chapter one.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.100]   If you have a Bible, you can flip right there.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.540]   If not, it'll be up on the screens.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.540]   We're gonna look at the setup
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.840]   that led to the savior of the world, Jesus being born.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.340]   Matthew verse 18, this is right after we finished last week
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.940]   and remember in scandals, we went through Judah and Tamar
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.500]   and Matthew goes out of his way to be like,
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.100]   look at all these crazy people in Jesus's family tree
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.020]   like Judah and Tamar where he basically slept
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.660]   with his daughter-in-law and not only that,
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.180]   Jesus was related to Rahab.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.420]   Remember Rahab, Grandma Rahab?
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.960]   Yeah, the prostitute and he walks through and goes through
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.820]   and then David and Bathsheba and adultery
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.160]   and he's traced all these scandals
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.100]   and then he goes into the scandals
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.020]   surrounding the birth of Jesus and what we learn about him.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.340]   So this comes in verse 18 right after we finished
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.380]   the lineage and genealogy, it says this.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.820]   "This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.740]   "His mother Mary was engaged or pledged
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.080]   "to be married to Joseph.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.060]   "But before they came together,
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.060]   "she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.960]   "because Joseph, her husband," at that time to be engaged
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.020]   basically meant in order to break off an engagement,
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.460]   you had to do something legally
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.140]   to break down that engagement.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.460]   "He was a faithful man to the law
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.000]   "and he didn't want to expose her to public disgrace.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.220]   "He had in mind that he would divorce her quietly."
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.820]   Now you've heard this story before
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.700]   and you kind of know how it ends
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.820]   but I want you to think about what Joseph and Mary
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.900]   felt in that moment.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.260]   You got this happy, engaged couple,
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.100]   things are going great, planning the wedding,
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.540]   picking out invitations, she's picking out a dress,
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.980]   all the different things that you'd be excited
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.820]   about getting married in that day.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.520]   And one day she realizes, "I'm pregnant."
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.360]   And she shows up at Joe's house and says,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   crazy story, okay, so I'm pregnant and God is the father.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.460]   And to us, you're familiar with it
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.260]   but think about all the emotions that you,
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.180]   I mean, what would you think?
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.460]   JD's engaged right now.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.100]   They're weeks away from getting married.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.940]   If Jenna, his fiance, showed up and she was like,
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.460]   "Hey, this is gonna sound crazy but I'm having a baby."
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.940]   And no, it's not anybody else's baby, it's God's baby.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.520]   What would you respond with?
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.300]   And so of course Joseph is going,
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.820]   "Man, this girl's not just pregnant, she's crazy.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.860]   "And so I'm not gonna end up marrying crazy."
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.300]   Until that night, an angel shows up and says this.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.660]   "After he considered this, an angel of the Lord
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.240]   "appeared to Joseph in a dream and said,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.300]   "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.640]   "home as your wife because what is conceived in her
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.800]   "is from the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.440]   "She will give birth to a son
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.240]   "and you are to give him the name Jesus
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.240]   "because he will save his people from their sins."
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.380]   You're gonna have a baby
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.480]   that will be the savior of your people.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.420]   All of this took place, Matthew says,
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.660]   to fulfill what the Lord had said to the prophet.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.660]   "The virgin will conceive,"
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.180]   and he quotes an Old Testament prophet,
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.880]   "and give birth to a son
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.180]   "and they will call him Immanuel."
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.820]   It was to be born of a virgin.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.380]   The Jewish people at the time were looking for a savior,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.500]   someone that was gonna be born of a virgin,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.860]   not exactly the story of any person.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.640]   And so this was part of the sign that would be there.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.500]   Larry King was a famous interviewer, worked for CNN,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.040]   and did as many interviews probably
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.220]   as anyone who's ever lived has done.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.220]   Oprah may give him a run for his money.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.980]   But he was asked, "If you could interview anybody,
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.580]   "who would you wanna interview?"
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.900]   And he very quickly said, "Jesus Christ."
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.140]   And I would have one question.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.220]   "Were you really born of a virgin?"
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.620]   That's kind of funny on the surface
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.980]   because for me it'd be like,
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.420]   man, that's the one that you're gonna get hung up on?
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.980]   But Larry King was Jewish
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.940]   and he knew that Jesus and the Messiah
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.420]   would be born of a virgin.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.540]   And all this takes place, and then it says in verse 24,
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.340]   "When Matthew woke up,
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.280]   "he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him,
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.180]   "and he took Mary home as his wife.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.840]   "But he did not consummate the marriage
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.860]   "until she gave birth to his son,
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.500]   "and he gave him the name Jesus."
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.580]   That is not how anybody sees their wedding night going.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.500]   Did you see that?
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.100]   He takes her home, marries her,
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.900]   and it says that they don't sleep together
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.140]   even though he's his wife until after the birth of his son.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.140]   What do you do on the wedding night?
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.580]   You know, it's like board games?
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.540]   You playing Scrabble?
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.380]   What are you doing?
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.060]   [audience laughs]
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.940]   All these different turns in a scandal
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.900]   that Jesus and Joseph and Mary
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.380]   would carry for the rest of their life.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.380]   I mean, you're growing up in a small town
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.820]   where everybody knows,
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.380]   and oh, you're the kid whose mom was pregnant by God, right?
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.020]   And yet that's exactly what God was up to.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.340]   And through the unplanned pregnancy,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.820]   which was actually the most planned pregnancy of all time,
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.300]   God would bring forward into the world a Savior
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.300]   to save his people from something very specific, their sins.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.660]   He would send on a mission to deliver them
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.480]   not from Rome or from a political empire
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.700]   or from some army somewhere.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.060]   He will deliver his people from their sins.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.500]   The first thing that we see about God
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.100]   is very simply God sent the Savior.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.980]   He didn't send a list of rules.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.540]   He didn't send a sermon.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.020]   He didn't send a new religion.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.940]   He didn't send a bunch of advice.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.940]   He sent someone to save you and me
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.940]   because nothing else other than sending someone
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.300]   to save them from their sins would accomplish anything.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.900]   There's no amount of rules, no amount of religion,
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.980]   there's no amount of philosophy
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.660]   or no amount of advice that somebody can give you
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.580]   to provide the biggest solution
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.140]   for the biggest problem that you have, which is sin.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.540]   And the fact that you and I have sinned
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.100]   against a perfect God through our actions,
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.380]   through our thoughts, through our lives in general,
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.660]   and God didn't send his Son into the world
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.980]   so that you could try harder
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.260]   or to be a motivational speaker.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.260]   He sent it to be a Savior from your sins and my sins.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.880]   The first idea that God sent a Savior into the world.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.440]   The name Yeshua, or the name he used to call is Jesus.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.580]   The Hebrew word is Yeshua.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.620]   It's a word that was, is translated Joshua
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.560]   most closely in English.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.760]   Joshua was the person who saved the nation of Israel
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.340]   in the Old Testament.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.420]   And so Joseph is hearing this and he's told by an angel,
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.240]   "And that baby will be the Savior of your people.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.180]   "And you're gonna call him Yeshua."
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.120]   And my guess is Joseph thought, of course,
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.780]   you know he's gonna show up and this will be the Messiah,
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.080]   the military leader.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.880]   He's gonna save them from their sins.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.100]   Joshua, I'm sorry, Joseph wouldn't have been thinking,
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.420]   "You know what we need right now?
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.060]   "We need a solution for our sins."
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.960]   He would have thought, "We have a solution for our sins.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.300]   "It's two miles up the road.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.320]   "It's called a temple.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.640]   "You go in there and when you sin,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.300]   "you sacrifice a goat or you sacrifice a lamb."
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.300]   But God knew all of that sacrificial system
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.760]   was always pointing to a Savior.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.380]   And that unplanned pregnancy and scandal
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.140]   that Joseph was experiencing had been planned
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.780]   from the beginning of the world
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.540]   'cause God was sending a Savior.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.040]   Now part of the challenge of accepting a Savior
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.420]   and being willing to accept someone helping save you
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.860]   is you have to believe and understand
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.020]   that you actually need rescuing.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.700]   If not, you're not gonna have any openness or willingness
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.300]   or desire to be saved from something.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.140]   What do I mean by that?
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.220]   The other day, or about a month ago,
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.840]   my wife was driving along the road
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.420]   and somebody pulled up next to her in the car.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.780]   She's with our two kids.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.900]   And the person next to her in the car
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.140]   is screaming at her and waving her hands
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.820]   and saying something at her.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.660]   And when you're driving along the road
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.660]   and somebody's doing that, you just think,
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.220]   man, this is a crazy person or there's road rage going on
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.500]   or what is happening right now?
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.620]   And the person is flagging her down and flagging her down
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.660]   and she's just like, "All right, kids,
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.020]   "we're gonna keep moving, keep moving."
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.040]   And he keeps waving at her, waving at her, waving at her.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.140]   And then smoke starts coming out of her engine
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.380]   she can see in the front.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.120]   And very quickly, your car begins to break down.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.440]   The person that was waving at her
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.100]   wasn't waving like, "Ah, ah," trying to get her.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.940]   He was saying, "Your car is smoking, it's smoking.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.300]   "I can see the smoke from back here.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.500]   "You can't see it from where you are,
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.180]   "but your car is smoking."
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.760]   And in a moment, what went from her thinking,
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.600]   this person is here to hurt me,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.360]   became this person is here to help me
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.320]   because she recognized I have a problem.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.600]   Perhaps one of the biggest barriers
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.820]   to people coming to faith
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.220]   is not actually believing that you have a problem.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.340]   That you need a savior.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.800]   Because until you get to the place where you go,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.280]   "Man, I am not, I can attempt to try to be a better person.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.080]   "I can attempt to try to earn my way to God,
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.240]   "but I will never be good enough if there's a perfect God
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.980]   "to live as he would want me to."
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.340]   I can't save myself that you're receptive and open to,
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.140]   "Oh, I've got a problem, I need help."
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.600]   Versus, "Oh man, this is, I don't have a problem
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.340]   "and anybody telling me I need to change,
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.260]   "they're just trying to harm me."
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.020]   But Jesus was sent and Joseph began to realize
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.860]   and Mary began to realize to be a savior
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.420]   for you, me, and for all people from our sin.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.500]   And then we're told after this,
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.220]   about a year later, a year to a year and a half later,
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.600]   Matthew 2, verse one,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.700]   Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.240]   During the time of King Herod,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.780]   Magi, and you may have wise men,
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.220]   from the east came to Jerusalem and they asked,
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:44.120]   "Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.380]   "We saw his star when it rose
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.760]   "and we have come to worship him."
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.160]   So this translation for east would have been
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.480]   around the area of Iran or modern day Iran today
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.220]   and these Magi, which is a word that's kind of connected
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.740]   to magicians or mystics and they were astrologers,
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.200]   that they were looking at the stars,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.060]   these men that were coming from the Middle East traveled
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.620]   and they saw this star and they came in town and said,
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.900]   "Hey, we're trying to find the child that was born
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.820]   "because we want to worship him."
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.960]   And word begins to break out.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.060]   Now when you think about the wise men,
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.000]   here's the problem with the wise men,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.020]   there was a song in 1800s or late 1800s
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.980]   that basically ruined how we think about the wise men
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.260]   because it was, "We three kings of Ori and Ar,"
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.580]   whatever the rest of the song goes.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.180]   And it makes us think there were three kings.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.000]   One, they weren't kings
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.980]   and one, there wasn't three of them.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.300]   There's no reference to three.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.580]   There's three gifts that they bring
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.740]   but it was likely a caravan of people
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.040]   that had traveled from the Middle East
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.820]   and they show up and they're in the city of Jerusalem
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.640]   and they go, "Hey, where's the one
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.860]   "who's been born King of the Jews?"
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.980]   When Herod or King Herod heard this,
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.100]   he was disturbed or furious
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.080]   and all of Jerusalem with him.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.020]   Now why?
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.060]   King Herod was the king of this city of Jerusalem
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.720]   and really the area, I think governor of that area.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.160]   But he had a title that was King of the Jews.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.540]   And so this would be him showing up
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.300]   and somebody going into UT, Austin and saying,
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.460]   "Hey, I'm looking for the one
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.180]   "who was born governor of Texas."
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.620]   And Governor Abbott being like,
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.760]   "What do you mean the one who was?"
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.340]   "He's right here, I'm sitting in the Capitol building."
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.220]   That's what's happening with Herod.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.180]   And Herod, the reason all of Jerusalem was disturbed
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.180]   is Herod was crazy.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.220]   By crazy, I mean crazy.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.340]   He was paranoid.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.940]   He thought constantly people were trying
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.060]   to take the throne from him.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.800]   He was brutal and violent.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.200]   He had 10 sons, two of them he thought
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.860]   were gonna attempt to take the throne from him.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.140]   So he killed two of his sons.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.460]   He killed one of his wives
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.980]   because he thought she was gonna scheme
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.180]   with the other children to take his throne.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.780]   He was so violent that when he was making preparations
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.580]   for when he was gonna die,
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.380]   he ordered that chief officials
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.980]   from the highest level of government
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.420]   all over the city of Jerusalem,
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.860]   the day that Herod died, they were to be put to death
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.500]   because he knew, "When I die, no one's gonna cry.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.580]   "So I want there to be mourning in the streets of Jerusalem.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.620]   "So I want you to kill all of them too."
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.300]   I mean, he's just a vicious, brutal guy.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.940]   So when Herod is upset that,
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.380]   "Hey, there's somebody else claiming to be king,"
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.900]   all of Jerusalem was in danger.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.860]   Then Herod called the magi or the wise men secretly
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.060]   and he found out from them
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.940]   exactly the time the star had appeared.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.540]   And he sent them to Bethlehem.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.000]   And he said, "Go and search carefully for the child.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.780]   "As soon as you find him, report him to me
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.380]   "so that I may go too and murder him, no, and worship him."
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.340]   You know that's what he's thinking.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.700]   So they go off, so Herod goes, he's like,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.660]   "Oh yeah, they're in Bethlehem.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.200]   "Go see, find them in Bethlehem.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.840]   "And when you do, I'd love to see him too
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.760]   "and come celebrate and bring a housewarming gift.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.860]   "And so come back and let me know."
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.920]   And it says this, "The wise men,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.660]   "on coming to the house of Mary and Joseph,
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.920]   "they saw the child with his mother Mary,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.220]   "and they bowed down and worshiped him."
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.460]   Jesus is, at this point, he's a toddler.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.780]   He's barely able to walk.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.440]   And this little child they see,
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.860]   and something is so remarkable,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.740]   they show up and they worship him.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.440]   "They opened their treasures to him
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.480]   "and presented him with three gifts,
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.600]   "gold, frankincense, and myrrh."
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.260]   Come back to that in a second.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.840]   "And having been warned in a dream
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.940]   "not to go back to Herod,
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.140]   "they returned to their country by another route."
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.040]   So these three are this group of men
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.360]   that are basically stargazers and mystics and seekers
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.660]   are watching stars one day out in the Middle East
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.640]   or somewhere in Iran.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.060]   They see a star and they feel called by God
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.500]   to go follow that star.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.720]   They show up and they find the savior of the world,
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.480]   a man that they had never had any interest in looking
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.420]   and searching for and had no idea and understanding of.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.980]   And yet the star shows up and God leads and calls them
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.400]   to go find him.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.040]   The other scandal we see here is that God
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.800]   takes these mystics, these people who should've been
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.280]   the farthest from the first visitors that show up
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.360]   at Mary and Joseph's house.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.200]   I mean, think about that.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.440]   There's a knock at the door and all of a sudden
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.560]   a caravan of people from another nation just show up
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.400]   and they're like, "Hey, we're here.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.240]   "We saw the star.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.440]   "We'd love to see your toddler.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.640]   "How creepy is that?"
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.140]   That's exactly what's going on.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.340]   And yet God was doing something.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.460]   God, the second idea we see from this story,
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.580]   is seeking all people.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.620]   God is seeking everybody.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.100]   I want you to think about something before.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.540]   You've heard the three wise men before.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.440]   Your mom has it on the nativity set, on the fireplace.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.260]   Why is that story included in the Bible?
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.860]   One, because it happened.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.620]   Why would God have that story happen?
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.500]   These people, they weren't Jewish.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.120]   They weren't of a Christian faith.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.960]   They were just people.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.560]   They were out watching stargazing
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.060]   in the middle of the desert and God calls them.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.360]   I mean, they were seeking that star,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.120]   but more than that, God was seeking them.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.080]   He put the star.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.760]   He moved them to go follow it.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.960]   Because God is a God who seeks all people.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.880]   The message and the reason it's included inside of this
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.260]   is because Matthew knew what so many Jewish people
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.900]   at the time they were reading and today still believe,
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.340]   that God is just a God for the Jewish people,
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.460]   that he really cares about the Jews.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.280]   And Matthew's right.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.740]   No, his heart is for all people.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.980]   God's heart is for all people, red, yellow, black, white,
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.860]   every race, every nation, every time.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.900]   God's heart is for all people.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.700]   In other words, the belief in Matthew's day
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.260]   was that God really, really loved the Jewish people.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.340]   Everybody else, he's kind of like,
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.500]   yeah, you guys are okay,
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.980]   but I really love the Jewish people.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.660]   Give me a J, give me an E, give me a W.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.740]   That's what I'm all about.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   And Matthew says, no, God's heart is for everyone.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.200]   It always has been.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   And at the birth or the toddler phase of Jesus's life,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.840]   God takes these men who spoke different languages
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.800]   with different backgrounds from a different nationality
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.400]   and he said, go see 'em.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.040]   Go see the one you were made for.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.680]   And they fall on their face and they worship him.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.940]   Wherever you're at in the room right now,
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.640]   God is seeking a relationship with you.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.720]   You're not too far gone, you're past, you're present,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.980]   your future doesn't keep him from wanting you.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.840]   Even if you can't see it or you don't believe it,
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.040]   you're not even sure that he's there.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.160]   My daughter is three and we play hide and seek
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.880]   and she's at that stage of life when you play hide and seek
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.520]   where it's really not that hard to find her
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.920]   'cause she'll go hide and she'll just stand
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.200]   in the middle of the living room, behind an ornament
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.440]   and she does something that's kind of funny
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.100]   and of course, you've been around kids,
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.100]   you've seen kids do this, where they will cover their eyes
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.280]   and they'll be standing in just plain sight
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.400]   and you're hiding or they're hiding
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.880]   and they're just covering their eyes
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.220]   and you have to intentionally not look for them
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.280]   or intentionally walk around like,
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.960]   oh, where could she be?
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.840]   I can't see her.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.440]   Is she over here underneath the mat?
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.280]   Is she?
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.360]   Because she thinks if I can't see him, he's not there.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.720]   If I can't see him, he's not there and he can't see me.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.040]   It's funny when you're three,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.360]   but a lot of people live their entire life that way.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.780]   They think, man, if I can't see God, he's not there
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.160]   and when it's a three-year-old, we can say,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.760]   oh, that's so silly.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.800]   Just 'cause you can't see him
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.120]   doesn't mean that he's not there.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.080]   What if God, even if you can't fully,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.180]   entirely, completely always see him,
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.440]   what he's doing, his presence,
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.840]   doesn't mean that he's not there?
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.120]   Because the Bible would say
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.880]   he has been seeking in every breath,
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   even the fact that you're in a church on a Tuesday night
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.760]   is God seeking, not these people, you,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.760]   every person in the room,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.000]   every person you've ever met,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.640]   God is seeking to have a relationship with.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.360]   When you're at the bar and you are so wasted,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.600]   you cannot walk, God is seeking you.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.340]   He's not giving up on you.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.440]   When you find yourself in that place
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.520]   where you're deciding, man, I don't know if,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.700]   I can leave and walk out of this house right now
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.640]   because of the one-night-stand shame that I have,
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.560]   he's seeking you.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.480]   He's never stopped, he never will stop.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.140]   From the moment you took your first breath
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.400]   to the moment you take your last,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.920]   has been wanting a relationship with you
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.600]   and he was sought after those men
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.840]   just like he's seeking after you
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.820]   'cause our God seeks every person.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.840]   These men went to Iran.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.560]   You know what's interesting, just quick side note,
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.640]   Iran is a predominantly Islamic nation
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.840]   and Iran is a place in many Islamic countries
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.480]   in the world today where you can literally lose your life
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.240]   or be severely outcast from society
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.560]   for converting away from Islam,
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.520]   from becoming a Christian
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.160]   and yet God continues to seek
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.880]   and an awakening is happening
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.600]   in Islamic territories and countries
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.080]   where people are coming to Jesus
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.440]   and you wanna know what one of the most common ways
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.280]   they're doing it?
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.240]   Through dreams.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.800]   Studies estimate that one in three
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.700]   Muslim background Christians come to faith through dreams.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.560]   A man and the stories are crazy.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.920]   There's a book by Tom Doyle named Dreams and Visions
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.960]   who's a missionary, runs a ministry in the Middle East.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.040]   The stories are eerily, eerily similar
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.600]   where they say and they use the word Isa
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.680]   is the translation of the word that they use for Jesus.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.360]   I was sleeping and a man woke me up
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.680]   and it was Isa, it was Jesus
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.820]   and he said, "I made you, I died for you.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.100]   "You were made to know me."
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:44.300]   And they take the step and they trust in Jesus.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.820]   One in three, I don't know about you.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.520]   There's not a lot of times in a lot of people
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.960]   that I interact with where I hear one in 100
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.500]   come to faith through dreams.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.760]   For it to be one in three is staggering
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.040]   but it tells us the same God who sought the wise men
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.880]   is still seeking today, he's still seeking you
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.920]   and he still seeks in nations and places
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.300]   where they can't talk about Jesus
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.560]   or the scriptures are not tolerated
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.120]   'cause our God seeks every person.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.180]   Really quickly, finally, they bring these three gifts
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.960]   that even those were symbolic.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.720]   They bring gold, frankincense and myrrh.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.320]   Gold, probably the easiest, clearest
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.280]   is a sign of royalty or for a king
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.360]   and they're opening these gifts up
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.280]   and they're handing them to Mary
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.520]   and my guess is she sees the gold and she's like, "Money!"
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.220]   Probably never even seen gold before
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.600]   and so all of a sudden they've got this gold
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.200]   she stores away and then frankincense.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.120]   Frankincense is not really something
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.600]   that people give a lot of today
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.780]   but it's connected to incense.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.920]   It represents priest or being a priest.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.760]   What's a priest?
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.680]   Jesus is called the high priest.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.960]   A priest intercedes or goes to God on behalf of his people.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.280]   Jesus goes to God and it represents
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.900]   that Jesus would be the high priest.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.520]   He would be the king, gold,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.960]   he would be the high priest for his people.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.560]   And then myrrh.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.180]   Now myrrh is probably the weirdest of all of them
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.760]   and it certainly would have been weird to Mary
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.880]   because what was myrrh used for?
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.320]   My guess is you don't have a lot of myrrh
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   sitting around your house
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.180]   but myrrh was used for embalming the dead.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.200]   In other words, when somebody would die,
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   their body would be preserved through putting myrrh over it
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.680]   to help provide for burial.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.920]   And Mary's opening it up.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.620]   You've gotta think, what's going through her head
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.920]   if she's going, "Oh man, gold.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.160]   "Now he's going to college, okay,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.040]   "and frankincense, we'll burn some of that later.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   "It'll smell real good like candle."
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   And an embalming fluid.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.960]   This is the king or the epitome of one of those gifts
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.400]   where somebody gives it to you and you're like,
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.100]   "Oh, oh, this is so nice, this sweater
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.320]   "that I will be giving to Goodwill."
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.640]   And you've gotta think that's going on
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.440]   but why would they give that to him?
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.840]   Because they knew this child,
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.000]   unlike every other child who's ever lived,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.320]   was born to die.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.240]   That he was born to be the savior of the world
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.340]   through death.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.640]   And they show up and they give.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.480]   I mean, this would be akin to giving an urn
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.660]   for ashes someday.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.500]   And they give it at the birth of Jesus
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.800]   because though he was sleeping in a crib,
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.400]   one day he would go to a cross
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.060]   for every person in this room, listening online,
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.360]   and every person that's ever lived.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.460]   And the wise men knew.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.740]   Finally, so we see that God is seeking after all people.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.640]   God sent a savior.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.520]   Then we see perhaps the craziest of the whole story.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.560]   It says this.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.880]   They leave, the Magi leave and head off
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.720]   and they go back to their country.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.240]   When they had gone, an angel of the Lord
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.060]   appeared to Joseph in a dream.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.440]   "Get up," he said.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.680]   "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.400]   "Stay there until I tell you.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.560]   "For Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.240]   So he got up and he took the child and his mother
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.080]   during the night and they left for Egypt.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.720]   This is what I mean by it's so much more scandalous
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.800]   in Matthew's gospel than in Luke.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.240]   Where Luke talks about the angels and they show up
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.000]   and they worship and glory to God in the highest
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.840]   and peace on earth.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.200]   And then Matthew, an angel shows up and he's like,
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.000]   "Everybody move out of the house, out of the house,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.240]   "out of the house, head to Egypt."
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.000]   And in the middle of the night, they take off to Egypt.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.600]   And another scandal where they would be refugees
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.760]   for the next few years.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.480]   Living, running, fleeing from people
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.400]   who wanted to take their life.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.560]   When Herod realized, verse 16,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.560]   that he'd been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.240]   And he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.340]   in its vicinity, or the surrounding area,
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.140]   who were two years old and under,
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.080]   in accordance with what he had learned from the Magi.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.760]   So Herod says, "If they're not gonna come back and tell me,
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.280]   "I'll get rid of the problem myself,
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.200]   "and I will kill every boy under,
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.960]   "or two years old and under, inside of the town."
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.120]   Think about Mary, who would have known this.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.200]   Who every child that Jesus, 'cause you know, new moms,
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.560]   like they haven't changed in 2,000 years.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.080]   You got a baby, moms, they just kind of flock together.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.520]   And so she would have known other moms of other one
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.320]   and one and a half year olds that lived
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.240]   and were around Jesus.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.560]   Whose baby was killed.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.080]   Because Herod thought, you know what?
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.720]   I'm just gonna kill every child there,
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.360]   and through death, I'm gonna put an end to Christmas.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:51.840]   And was unaware that God had a plan the entire time
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.400]   to send a child, and through Christmas,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.120]   put an end to death.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.760]   And he told the child, or he told Joseph,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.440]   take Mary and your family and escape.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.280]   Herod was threatened.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.800]   I mean, Herod, why would Herod do this?
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.520]   Because Herod, as I've said before,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.280]   he was paranoid of somebody taking the throne from him.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   He was terrified that somebody, I have a kingdom,
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.880]   and I will protect it at all costs,
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.000]   even if I have to kill a bunch of toddlers, I will do it.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.160]   Because he didn't want anything
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.680]   that could possibly threaten him and his kingdom.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.280]   The irony, and the sad thing,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.320]   is that Herod didn't understand that Jesus showed up,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.960]   and he wasn't just a gift for Jewish people,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.120]   or just a gift for certain people.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.560]   He was to be a savior for all people, including Herod.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.360]   In Luke chapter two, when the angels do show up,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.800]   they say this, in Luke chapter two, verse 10,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.920]   "Do not be afraid, I give you good news,"
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.840]   talking about the birth of Jesus, "to the shepherds.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.200]   "This will cause great joy for all the people."
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.360]   This is a good gift for all people everywhere.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.980]   Herod, this isn't something that's a threat.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.920]   This is a gift, the savior of the world.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.880]   But Herod thought, and this saying,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.380]   "I see Jesus as a threat to my life,
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.280]   "not as a gift to my life."
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.360]   What's funny is this still happens all the time,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.540]   where people think God, who's here to give good
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.620]   and bring good about, and they see him as,
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.500]   "Man, I don't know that I wanna let you in all of my life."
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.080]   It's like this, my daughter, like I said,
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.600]   it's just something with kids when they're young,
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.700]   and she's at that stage,
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.760]   I think she was two in this picture I'm about to show you,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.100]   where we'll go see Santa, and when we go see Santa,
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.080]   kids do what they do when they're like three and under,
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.240]   and they just freak out.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.080]   It kinda makes sense.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.480]   They've never seen white hair before.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.840]   They're like, "What happened to this guy?
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.920]   "And he's wearing a red robe, and that's just,
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.840]   "it's creepy to me."
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.000]   And so we'll go see Santa,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.080]   and it just comes into territory.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.160]   This happened with all of our kids.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.840]   She's sitting on Santa's lap, and she's,
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.200]   this is like the calm state.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.160]   This is like, "All right, quick, take the picture."
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.700]   And she's just panicking, 'cause she can't,
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.420]   she's terrified, and she doesn't understand,
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.560]   "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Santa's a nice man.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.640]   "He's gonna give you gifts.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.680]   "Santa's a good, sit on his knee, it's okay.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.940]   "It's gonna be okay.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.880]   "He wants to give good things to you."
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.120]   She just sees him as a terrifying,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.560]   I don't even know what a two-year-old thinks
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.320]   of a person that close, and wants to be away from him.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.400]   It's funny that Herod had a similar posture
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.000]   towards Jesus, towards God.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.940]   And I don't see him as something
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.240]   that's gonna bring good in my life.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.900]   He's a threat.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.080]   But Herod's not alone.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.920]   There's a lot of people in the room
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.480]   that they see it that way.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.240]   I mean, some of us spend years and years of our life
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.200]   where you see God as a threat to you.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.860]   You see him not as like, "He's here to give good things.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.720]   "He's here to bring good things into your life."
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.680]   You see him as a threat that, "Oh, man, he's,
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.080]   "I don't want him too close.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.960]   "If he gets too close, man, I don't wanna have God,
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.920]   "he's a threat.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.660]   "Like, if I go all in with Jesus,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.020]   "it's gonna threaten how I wanna live.
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.940]   "It means I'm gonna have to stop
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.100]   "just partying all the time.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.200]   "Or it means I'm gonna have to change the way
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.340]   "that I dress, or it means I'm gonna have
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.820]   "to actually break up with this person
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.180]   "because God's gonna come in and be like,
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.100]   "No, that's not okay.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.080]   "Or it means I'm gonna have to stop having sex,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.540]   "or one-night stands, or sleeping around,
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.220]   "or doing what I wanna do with my life.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.240]   "And so not right now.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.780]   "I'll get serious about God someday,
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.700]   "when I'm in my 30s, when I wanna settle down,
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.920]   "and I wanna raise kids in the church.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.020]   "But right now, I wanna live my life, these are my 20s."
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:21.020]   And it's 'cause you see God as a threat, not as a gift,
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.860]   not as one who wants to bring good in your life,
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.740]   but you can trust.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.500]   And the Son of God, the Savior of the world, showed up.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.620]   And He was five miles away
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:42.300]   in the home of Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem,
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.500]   five miles away from Herod.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.060]   And He missed Him because He saw it.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.900]   It's a threat.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:53.820]   And if you have bought the idea that God is here
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.380]   to steal, take, rob, keep from,
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.400]   you, like Herod, have bought a lie.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.260]   And like a two-year-old, you're trying to explain,
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.000]   no, sin is, He gives good things, God.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.820]   He gives good things.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.020]   He wants to bring good things.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:12.980]   Any part of you that goes,
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.380]   "I don't know if I want Him that close,"
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:22.340]   has bought a lie about God.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.660]   Who He is, His love,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.260]   even what He just wants in your life,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.220]   like any good parent, He wants good things.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.220]   Herod claimed that he wanted to worship Jesus.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.820]   So the Magi, "Hey, you guys worship Him.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.140]   "I wanna worship Him too."
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.700]   But those were just words, a lip service.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.420]   He didn't really wanna worship Him.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.420]   He didn't have a genuine, real faith.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.820]   I was thinking about Christmas and Christmas trees,
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:58.220]   and got these two trees that are up here,
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.860]   and really similar, right?
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.980]   Same tree skirt, same decorations,
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.140]   but there's one key difference.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:13.860]   This one is real, as in it was actually a tree
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.380]   that was cut down.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.700]   It's got life that is inside of it.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.340]   There's water in the bottom watering it,
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.300]   because there's life that's inside of it.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.420]   And this one is fake.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.420]   It may look similar, it may look like it's real,
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.400]   but it's fake.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.380]   There's nothing tree, actual tree about it.
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.700]   There's no wood that makes it up.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.340]   It's made in a factory somewhere.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.940]   Even though it looks similar on the outside,
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.420]   and it's decorated in a similar way,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.620]   and they've got a lot of similarities,
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.740]   there's a huge difference.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.300]   One is real, and one is fake.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.260]   And I don't want you to live another day of your life
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.340]   if you're in the room with a fake faith.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.380]   There's no actual life inside of you,
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.580]   and your life looks pretty pretty.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.180]   You got a good car, you got a good job.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.920]   People look at you and they think you're a nice guy,
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.140]   a nice girl, but you've never actually trusted in Jesus.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.460]   You could say the words, you may know some Bible verses.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.860]   You grew up in Catholic school, you grew up in church,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.820]   and you know the stories, but you don't actually believe it.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.220]   In fact, you're at that place where like,
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.220]   hey, you're like, I don't want God.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.060]   Not yet.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.820]   I don't wanna change.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.220]   I don't want him in my life.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.180]   (soft music)
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.820]   Or you're at a place where you think
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.100]   you can earn your way to God by how you behave,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.500]   or you can't have a relationship with God
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.540]   because of what you have done.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.140]   All of those, fake faith.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.360]   True faith has life inside of it.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.580]   How does life come to live inside of someone?
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.500]   It comes by the moment where they say,
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.020]   Jesus, you on the cross,
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.280]   you died for everything I've ever done.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.100]   You came not to be the provider of a second chance,
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.340]   you came to be the savior of my sin,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.620]   and you gave your life for me, and I believe that.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.820]   And you rose from the dead, and the payment went through.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.460]   You are more than enough, and I will stand before God,
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.580]   and I will live with him forever.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.860]   Not because of how good I am,
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.900]   because of what you did for me.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.280]   You're my savior.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.620]   And that's a real faith.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:10.780]   Tragedy is Herod's kingdom, it came to an end.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.820]   He was fighting the inevitable.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.960]   In fact, the very next verse, it says, "And Herod died.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.940]   And the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.540]   and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother,
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.060]   and go back to the land of Israel.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.360]   Those who were trying to kill him have died.'"
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.660]   The third idea from the text that we see
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.220]   is that God sacrificed his son.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.900]   Herod goes in and sacrifices all of these children.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:41.000]   Ironically, God's plan would later, and Herod did so,
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.780]   put to death human life to protect his kingdom.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:54.700]   God allowed Jesus to have death take his life
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.940]   to protect you and the world,
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.340]   because God so loved the world,
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.340]   he gave his only son that whoever believes
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.540]   and accepts the scandalous payment of the life of God
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.440]   will not perish but have eternal life.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.460]   One thing, and I'll close here, it's ironic,
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.100]   as we just conclude, our God sent the savior,
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.500]   our God is seeking all people,
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.260]   and our God saves by sacrificing and by sacrificing his son.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.060]   In this season, we gather together and we have gifts.
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.420]   In your house or maybe in your family's house,
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.780]   you'll get a tree.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.180]   And underneath the tree, we'll put Christmas gifts,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.820]   and most people put Christmas gifts that are on there.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.540]   And when you look at those gifts, you'll try to evaluate,
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.700]   I wonder what could be in that one.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.180]   You know what some of the most valuable gifts
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.300]   that come in my house,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.440]   and often that are represented in my house,
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.420]   they sit on a tree.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.260]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.540]   I mean, you'll get like an envelope or grandma will sit,
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.860]   people who are like, "No, I'm not mailing gifts,
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.780]   "here's some cash."
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.340]   And they'll put a check or they put something in an envelope,
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.380]   or maybe it's a little box,
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.780]   and it's like a wedding ring or something of great value.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.220]   It may not be as big as the things underneath,
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.060]   but the most valuable things often are the ones
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.020]   that hang on a tree.
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.100]   And it's so fitting, and it's seasoned and ironic, honestly.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.060]   Where all over the country and all over the world,
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.980]   people will get trees and they will hang things on it
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.900]   to celebrate the birth of the one who came,
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.660]   to hang on a tree for them.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.540]   And just like the most valuable gifts,
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.420]   at least in my house,
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.940]   are often the ones hanging on a tree.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.220]   The most valuable gift God could ever give
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.580]   was the life of Jesus,
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.260]   who hung not on a Christmas tree,
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.540]   but hung on a tree on a hill called Calvary,
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.980]   for you and for me and for every person who's ever lived
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.180]   and to pay for their sins.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.300]   First Peter chapter two, verse 24 says,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.860]   "He, Jesus, bore our sins in his body on a tree,
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.200]   "that we may die to sin, live to righteousness.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.780]   "By his wounds, you have been healed."
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:11.780]   The scandal of Christmas is that God,
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.340]   rich in love and mercy,
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.140]   would give the most valuable gift imaginable
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:21.940]   and hang it on a tree for you and for me.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.140]   And if you've never had a moment where you accepted that,
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.380]   God is extending the greatest gift
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.420]   you will ever receive in your life,
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.380]   but he will not force you to accept it.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.180]   You have to decide, I believe that, I receive that.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.660]   You died for me.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.100]   And tonight is your night if you have it.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.300]   And when you do, all of heaven, we're told,
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.280]   erupts in joy,
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.220]   because one who is made for God
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.280]   has stepped into the relationship with him,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.860]   through Christ, by believing and accepting it.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.940]   Let me pray.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.460]   Father, thank you for the scandal of the cross.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.020]   I pray for anyone in this room
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.820]   who has bought the lie that you are a threat
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.100]   there to take from them,
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.900]   rather than bring them life,
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.540]   you would pierce and break through with the truth.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.660]   You're a good, loving, perfect father.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.820]   I pray for anyone who's never accepted that free gift
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.660]   and tonight you would allow their heart right now,
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.540]   where they are, to have it pressed on them by you.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.420]   And they would accept by grace,
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.820]   through faith, what you have done on their behalf.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.100]   Thank you that you lived the life we couldn't
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.220]   and you died the death for us.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.940]   You are the one who saves us from our sins
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.380]   and we worship you now in song, amen.
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:09.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
