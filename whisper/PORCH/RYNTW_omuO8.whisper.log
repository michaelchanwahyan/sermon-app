[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   And here's the thing, we're about to sing one more song and it's, the song talks
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.680]   about the reign of Christ. The lyrics of the song are "You reign above it all, over
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.840]   the universe in every heart." And we definitely want that for this room here
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.200]   in Dallas, Texas at The Porch. We want the rule and reign of Christ in our lives.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.880]   And yet this is just a moment for young adults here in Dallas to gather together
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.920]   and to pray that for the Middle East tonight, for what's happening in Israel
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.560]   and Gaza. We want to pray for the rule and reign of Christ. I don't know how
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.040]   that war has been hitting you over the last few days. I'm actually half
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.240]   Palestinian and it has wrecked me, honestly. And so I'd imagine there are
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.480]   people here who are Jewish, there are people here who are Palestinian, and
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.920]   you're just wrestling with how to respond internally. And we just have a
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.640]   moment that we can seek the face of God together. As a generation here in Dallas,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.800]   Texas, we can beg God to do something together. So here's what I want to do.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.160]   There's a lot of freedom right now. If you want to get on your knees, you can
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.120]   get on your knees. If you want to stay standing, you can. If you want to sit down,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.360]   you can. If you want to pray out loud, you can pray out loud. If you want to
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   pray with the person next to you, you can pray with the person next to you. If you
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.720]   just want to sit silently in this moment, you can. But I just want to lead us
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.000]   through praying for a few things, and I'm going to ask you to respond. This is a
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.840]   chance for the people of God to lean in together and to ask for God's rule and
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.000]   reign. So here's the first thing that I want to invite us to pray for. One is I
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.320]   want to invite us to pray that God would show himself to be comforter for all of
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.200]   the family and friends that have lost loved ones. The death tolls right now,
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.920]   it's somewhere around a thousand Israelis. It's somewhere around 900
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.320]   Palestinians. So you think about the amount of loved ones that those people
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.080]   who have passed away, all that they represent. And let me just say, as half
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.120]   Palestinian, please don't view those 900 Palestinians as terrorists who deserved
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.880]   it. They're people created in the image of God. And so let me just ask for us to
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.640]   beg God to comfort right now. So you can pray out loud, you can pray with someone
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.960]   next to you, you can get on your knees, but let's pray. Let's pray together and
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   just ask for the Lord's comfort in all the people's lives who have lost
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.560]   loved ones.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:03:05.880]   [Music]
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.160]   And then next I want to invite you to just pray for the gospel to break
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.040]   through. I have to believe that a good majority of the people who passed away
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.400]   did not have a relationship with Jesus, and so we just want to beg that the
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.040]   gospel would break through in this moment in a supernatural way, and that
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.240]   there would be many Jews and Palestinians who would know Jesus
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.520]   Christ as the true Messiah and as the Savior of the world tonight. So I want to
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.400]   invite you to pray out loud and to beg God on behalf of countless people in the
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.360]   Middle East right now that they would know Jesus Christ in a personal way, that
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.960]   that God would reveal himself to people in miraculous ways in this moment.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   [Music]
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   [Music]
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.280]   And as you just continue to pray, news reports that there's about at least a
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.360]   hundred people who were taken hostage, and so would you pray for those
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.440]   hostages, that God would sustain them, that he would preserve them, that he
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.520]   would return them to their families safely?
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.520]   [Music]
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   [Music]
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.520]   [Music]
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   [Music]
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   [Music]
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   [Music]
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   [Music]
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   [Music]
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:34.720]   And then here's what I want to pray for. Here is the reality. The reality is that
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:45.360]   hurt and hate can lead to all sorts of evil, and we've seen that in Hamas's
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:53.800]   attack on Israel, and yet I honestly I fear that in the extent to which Israel
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   will respond that there's a lot of hurt and there's a lot of hate, and that's a
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:09.560]   really dangerous thing. And so I even fear that there would be evil in the extent
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.440]   to which Israel would respond. And so here's what I'm asking you to pray.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:23.320]   I'm asking you to pray that Jesus Christ would rule and reign, and that justice
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:34.800]   would be executed, evil would be restrained, the innocent would be
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   preserved, and supernatural peace would come. That's what we're praying. That's
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:51.520]   what it looks like for Jesus to rule and reign above it all. That justice would be
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:04.840]   executed, that evil from either side would be restrained, that the innocent,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.320]   both Jew and Palestinian, would be sustained,
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:24.360]   and that the peace that can only come from the Prince of Peace would come.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:42.200]   Lord Jesus, we just put all of our hope in you. Our hope is all in you. Our hope
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:49.840]   is not in political figures in this world. Our hope is in you. As the King of
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.480]   Kings and the Lord of Lords, you, Jesus, have the name that is above every name.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:04.160]   And so I just want to ask and pray, King Jesus, that your rule and your reign would
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:16.480]   manifest itself in such a miraculous, just astounding way in the Middle East.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:23.280]   God, I do pray that you would execute justice and that you would restrain
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:31.280]   future evil, Lord God. And I pray that you would comfort the hurting. I pray that
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   you would sustain the innocent. I pray that you would preserve them. I pray that
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.640]   you would supernaturally minister to them and give them everything that they need
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:47.960]   in the tonight, tonight, God, and in the coming days, Lord. And Jesus, you are the
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.680]   Prince of Peace, and it's only by the reconciling power of the Gospel that
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   anything good can come in the midst of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. And so
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:09.480]   God, I pray that you would have your way and that you would rule and reign, that
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.000]   there would be revival in the Middle East, that hearts would be turned towards
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.320]   you, both Jew and Palestinian, that people would put their trust in you, that
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.640]   people would call upon the name of the Lord and be saved, and that you would do
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.080]   what only you can do. Our hope is in you, God. And so we stand and we just declare
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.440]   that you, Lord Jesus, do in fact reign above it all.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.020]   (gentle music)
