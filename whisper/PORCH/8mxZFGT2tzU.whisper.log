[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.940]   - How are we doing?
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.860]   Man, it's awesome to be here.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.420]   My name is Todd, I get to hang out with you guys
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.260]   every now and then.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.520]   I'm part of the team here at Watermark,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.600]   and it is awesome to be here with you guys
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.900]   and around the country that are tuning in.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.560]   And we are talking about self-care.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.120]   And we're specifically here not kinda having
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.800]   some myopic self-centered obsession.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.380]   We're not spiritual narcissists,
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.720]   but we know that we're blessed to be a blessing.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.660]   And so if we don't take care of ourself,
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.720]   if we're not taking care of who we are,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.000]   we can't be caregivers.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.040]   And so this series, self-care, we're wrapping up tonight
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.440]   and we're talking about probably the most important thing
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.280]   you can do.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.480]   People sometimes ask me, because of my role here
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.460]   at Watermark in Dallas, you know,
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.300]   which has grown to be something of, you know,
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.940]   pretty significant responsibility in size.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.800]   They just say, man, Todd, what's the most difficult thing
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800]   about leading this community?
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.420]   And my answer is always the same, and it comes quickly.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.880]   And that is, the most difficult thing for me
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.320]   to lead at Watermark is me.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   If I can control me, if I can discipline myself,
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.220]   if I can do the things that I need to do,
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.320]   it's amazing how much everything else
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.500]   just falls in the line.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.480]   But you need to know something, it is hard to discipline me.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.020]   I heard a guy say a long time ago,
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.100]   man, if there was a radio station, you know,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.260]   named after him, he would tune into it all the time.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.440]   You know, K. Todd, you know, all Todd, all the time.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.780]   I would tune into it.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.620]   It's just a fact.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.020]   I love me some me.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.060]   That's who I am.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.780]   As a person who has been separated from the God
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.600]   who cares for us.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.940]   Let me tell you why that's who I am,
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.260]   apart from the grace that has invaded my life.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.580]   Have you ever noticed that you pay attention
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.100]   to certain parts of your body only when they're jacked up?
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.780]   Right, like how many of you guys
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.300]   thought about your elbow today?
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.940]   The answer is everybody who banged their elbow.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.420]   That's who thought about their elbow.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.340]   How many of you guys thought about your kneecap?
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.540]   The answer is those of you that got up in the dark
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.400]   and you forgot that dag-num little coffee table was there
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.340]   and you were walking and you smacked your knee.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.300]   You thought about your kneecap.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.340]   How many of y'all thought about that left finger
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.980]   on your left hand?
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.180]   Right, that third one right here.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.340]   All right, well, that's a bad example for a bunch of singles
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.540]   'cause you probably thought about that a lot.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.260]   But let me just say this to you guys, all right,
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.140]   just for a second.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.460]   The reason you think about certain body parts
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.360]   is 'cause something's wrong with them.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.660]   When you obsess over something or your brain says,
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.120]   hey, we're gonna give some attention
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.460]   and some care to that thing,
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.660]   it's because that thing is throbbing.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.100]   That thing is not operating the way it should
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.220]   and it's saying, I need some attention.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.380]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.660]   When you're self-obsessed, when you are consumed
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.520]   with how you're being perceived,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   or when you turn in to your self-infatuation
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.860]   and your pleasure and your life plan all the time,
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.860]   it's 'cause something is broken there.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.340]   It's screaming out, this isn't how it should be.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.860]   But when you see somebody that is at a sense of peace
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.260]   and is not riddled by anxiety or despair
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.860]   or self-love and gloating and pride,
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.100]   you just come into something really glorious
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.320]   and beautiful there.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.580]   I love the statement,
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.620]   when a man or a woman forgets themself,
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.340]   they usually start to live in a way
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.700]   that everybody else remembers.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.500]   Because most of the people you meet, man,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.620]   they're just throbbing in pain
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.640]   and they're reaching out either to use you
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.340]   because they think you've got something
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.640]   that will give them life,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.320]   or they're trying just to get you to give them something
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.940]   that you think will have life.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.060]   And that's not the way God created us.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.180]   And so if you wanna be a person
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.020]   that can really care for others,
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.380]   that can be that person that forgets themself
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.580]   and to live in a way that everybody else remembers,
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.780]   then you gotta learn to care for yourself.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.300]   And man, God wants you to know,
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.780]   the best way to care for yourself
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.780]   is to come to the one who cares for you.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.180]   It's what he says.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.060]   Cast all your anxieties on me.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.900]   Why?
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.780]   Because I care for you.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.860]   There's an old statement that's in the scripture
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.140]   again and again and again, that's this,
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.260]   it's God's opposed to the proud,
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.780]   but he gives grace to the humble.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.260]   Humble yourself therefore into the mighty hand of God
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.020]   that he might exalt you in due time.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.060]   And I love the statement that if you try and do God's job,
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.900]   what's God's job?
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.580]   That little silly question I just gave you, right?
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.340]   Humble yourself into the mighty hand of God
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.860]   that he might exalt you in due time.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.220]   If you try and do God's job, which is to exalt yourself,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.680]   then he will do yours, which is to humble you.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.220]   Because none of us can care for ourself
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.680]   or produce for ourself what our soul was created for,
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.660]   which is to be in intimate relationship with the God
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.660]   who is and who loves and who gives grace and glory.
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's who God is.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.300]   I mean, if there's a little catchphrase, right,
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.140]   of my life, it's become this.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.460]   God's not looking to rip you off,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.900]   he's looking to set you free.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.460]   But let me read you some scripture just for a second.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.180]   It's found in 1 Timothy chapter four.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.460]   And this is what it says, that the Spirit,
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.480]   meaning God, has just told us explicitly,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.900]   which is like without any confusion,
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.860]   the Spirit explicitly says that in latter times,
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.300]   and man, we're living in 'em,
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.260]   some will fall away from the faith.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.700]   In fact, many people, this is even people
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.780]   that are around spiritual conversations,
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.020]   they're gonna fall away.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.900]   They're not gonna maintain the devotion to that
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.980]   which ultimately helps men live and women live
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.080]   with a sense of peace.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.260]   They're gonna pay attention to deceitful spirits
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.300]   and doctrines of demons.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.620]   And you're like, oh my goodness.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.580]   Spirits and demons, man, how do we deal with those?
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.740]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.440]   The way you deal with deceitful spirits
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.100]   and doctrines of demons, and I'm gonna tell you
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.980]   what deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons are
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.020]   in just a second, biblically is not to cast them out
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.300]   and not to bind them.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.180]   The Bible doesn't say we bind Satan.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.620]   Satan won't be bound until a much later part
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.900]   of God's kingdom program.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.940]   Right now, he's a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.100]   And what you're gonna find out
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.260]   is Satan has no power to create.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.500]   All he has the power to do is destroy.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.460]   All he has the power to do is to take what God says
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.380]   is good and right and beautiful and true
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.620]   and deceive you that it's bad and boring
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.460]   and life-sucking when in fact it's life-giving.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.700]   He is a deceiver.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.100]   He doesn't create anything beautiful.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.760]   He just deceives you into thinking
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.500]   that which seems right to you,
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.100]   but in the end is the way of death,
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.460]   is the right way to live.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.380]   The way we deal with demons biblically
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.780]   is not to cast them out, it's to bring truth in.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.700]   That's what we do.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.980]   It's always a truth encounter.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.960]   It's never a power encounter.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.700]   I want you to think about this for a second, okay?
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.840]   Jesus is the light of the world.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.660]   He came in the world, the scripture says,
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.060]   to bring them light.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.300]   He is life and light, and where there was death
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.740]   that was ruling sinful humanity
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.820]   that was separated from a God who is life,
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.860]   he came to bring life.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.260]   Where there was darkness and a lack of understanding,
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.780]   he came to bring light.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.700]   How do you deal with darkness in your house?
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.060]   What do you do?
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.580]   Do you get in there and cast out the darkness?
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.460]   Do you try and grab it and have a power encounter
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.500]   with the darkness and grab it and take it
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.820]   and throw it outside?
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.640]   No, the way that you get rid of the darkness is what?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.300]   You bring light in.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.220]   Darkness can't handle light.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.620]   That's all darkness is.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.780]   It's the absence of what should be.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.940]   It's like you can't make cold.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.500]   All we can do is produce heat.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.340]   Cold is the absence of heat.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.280]   Darkness is the absence of light.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.660]   That's all that it is.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.860]   And so I'm gonna tell you what the doctrines of demons
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.380]   and deceitful spirits are, and I'm gonna tell you
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.300]   how we're gonna handle them in order to not be deceived.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.000]   The doctrines of demons and the deceitful spirits
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.200]   that are in this world that are destroying people,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.720]   it's gonna be spelled out right here,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   basically in verses two and three,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.360]   but it all is wrapped up in this.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.420]   When God says, "I have come that you might have life
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.880]   "and have it abundantly,"
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.280]   demons say, "You better work hard to get life
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.700]   "and bring yourself to God in such a way
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.980]   "that he'll maybe decide to let you in a little bit
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.040]   "on his blessing."
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.820]   The doctrines of demons and deceitful spirits
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.540]   is that man must earn his way to God.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.320]   You're gonna see it spelled out right here.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.940]   There are men by means of hypocrisy, of liars,
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.000]   seated in their own conscience with a branding iron,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.020]   men who will watch this, forbid marriage
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.060]   and advocate abstaining from foods,
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.340]   which God has created to be gratefully shared
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.180]   by those who believe and know the truth.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.660]   In other words, the works-based mentality.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.140]   And this is why sometimes when people say,
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.580]   "Mentality, you religious person,"
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.100]   I don't ever answer that yes or no
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.880]   because I just wanna always understand
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.080]   what you mean by religion.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.140]   And if what you mean by religion
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.420]   is what most people are talking about
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.020]   when they talk about religion, which is,
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.540]   I do these things and eventually God will make a decision
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.380]   about how I've done,
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.580]   then I would say I'm not a religious person.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:51.020]   Religion ultimately is what man does,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.540]   but Christianity, the story of the scriptures,
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.080]   you need to know so many people in this room
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.500]   still even think that what this is is a rule book.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.300]   It's a bunch of morals and you better open it up
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.580]   and you better do what it says
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.700]   or you're not gonna get done what you want done,
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.840]   which is to be okay when you meet God.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.620]   No, this is not a rule book.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.480]   What this is a revelation.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.580]   It's a rescue story of God's love for you.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.020]   He explains why our world is filled with so much chaos,
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.140]   why it's so hurting, why it's throbbing in war
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.480]   and pain and poverty, because we have left the God
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.340]   who brings order and beauty in life.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.560]   And then he cares for us and so God pursues us
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.120]   and he runs after us and this book tells us who God is.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.720]   And he says, for sure I'm holy.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.760]   For sure I'm beautiful and perfect and holy and blameless
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.240]   and I can have no fellowship with those that aren't like me
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.880]   and I'm a just God and so I've got to judge what is not
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.800]   and what should not be.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.480]   But because I love you, I'm gonna make provision
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.080]   for those of you that have contributed to that chaos.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.440]   And I'm gonna show you a way back to me
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.760]   and I'm gonna pay a debt that I did not owe.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.880]   And being an eternally perfect creature,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.800]   I'm gonna need an eternally perfect sacrifice
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.520]   and guess what, I'm the only one that can provide that.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.840]   And so God told you it was coming
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.360]   and then he brought that great promise
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.800]   in the person of his son,
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.320]   who said I'm gonna do something for you that you can't do.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.680]   I'm gonna go someplace you can't go.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.280]   I'm gonna go before God and I'm gonna offer my life
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.360]   as a living, I mean as a perfect sacrifice.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.200]   God's gonna make me, though I'm rich, to become poor
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   so that through my poverty you might become rich.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.160]   And demons are gonna tell you
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.640]   that you're rich enough in good works
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.920]   and I'm gonna tell you that my standard's perfection
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.200]   and none of you have met it.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   And I'm not mad at you, I'm sad that you're broken
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.280]   and you're imperfection, I'm gonna rescue you from that
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.640]   and the way to rescue you from that
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.040]   is not to tell you to stop,
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.600]   but I'm gonna show you how good I am and love you.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.060]   I'm gonna make provision for you
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.320]   and then I'm gonna call you to follow me,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.120]   making up for every failure that you've got.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.800]   But I'm not gonna tell you to forbid marriage
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   and advocate abstaining from certain foods
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.960]   and not drink coffee or eat pork.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.000]   What I'm gonna tell you to do is to trust in me.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.560]   And anybody who tells you the way to get to God
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.100]   is through your own works is a teaching a doctrine of demon
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.500]   and is a deceiving spirit.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.780]   This is such an amazing verse right here in verse four.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.940]   You need to know this, everything created by God is good.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.660]   Everything, man, sex is good.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.740]   At the porch here and any place the Bible is taught,
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.420]   we don't say sex is bad, stay away from it.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.820]   We say sex is good.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.040]   What's not good is to use it poorly.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.980]   My classic illustration of this is like,
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.380]   I think about when my sons turned a certain age,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.160]   like if we lived out where we chopped wood
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.580]   to heat our house and to cook our food,
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.840]   that would be a pretty big deal, right?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.180]   To get a chainsaw for your 16th birthday, right?
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.780]   That would be a pretty big gift.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.580]   And if I gave my sons a chainsaw
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.300]   and we needed to chop wood both for a living,
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.260]   maybe to sell and also to warm our house and cook our food,
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.140]   and I gave them a chainsaw,
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.020]   they'd be like, "That's an amazing thing.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.240]   "Chainsaw's a glorious thing."
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.300]   But if they used the chainsaw as dental floss,
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.180]   that good gift that I gave them
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.180]   would be a problem, wouldn't it?
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.460]   The problem wasn't the chainsaw,
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.340]   the problem was how they used this beautiful thing.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.860]   What did I tell you about Satan?
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.000]   He's not a creative.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.640]   God, he can't give you anything.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.980]   All he can do is take a good thing and distort it.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.340]   Can I just tell you this?
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.100]   I mean, everything, including cocaine,
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.100]   including heroin, including marijuana, including alcohol,
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.900]   all of those things were created by God
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.020]   and are good if they are, watch this,
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.180]   sanctified by the word of God in prayer.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.020]   And I go, "Wait a minute,
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.860]   "did Todd just say that those things are good?"
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.180]   And the answer is yes,
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.300]   when they're sanctified by the word of God in prayer.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.280]   All those things are our derivative of plants
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.940]   that God has made that frankly,
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.080]   when we use them right now in modern science correctly,
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.180]   and we haven't been exactly using fentanyl correctly
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.900]   and hydrocodone correctly
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.700]   in the way we're dealing with some people right now
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.940]   that are coming even with normal surgeries,
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.800]   but when we use medicines correctly,
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.200]   it's a means of grace for people.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.300]   When we use them incorrectly as street drugs
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.700]   or inappropriately overly prescribed,
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.380]   it brings destruction.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.820]   But when you're sanctified by the wisdom of God
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.900]   and using the way that he created them,
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.860]   sex all the way to heroin,
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.660]   they can be a blessing to humankind.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.820]   And all I wanna do is just tell you that your God loves you,
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.700]   your father loves you,
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.460]   learn to use these things correctly, watch this,
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.780]   he cares for you.
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.900]   In verse six he says,
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.740]   "And pointing out these things to the brethren,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.520]   "you'll be a good servant of Jesus Christ."
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.360]   That God is good and that he loves you
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.400]   and that he's come to you,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.160]   you don't gotta make your way to him.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.100]   That's the doctrine of demons.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.460]   Works.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.140]   Can I say it to you one more time?
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.000]   God has demonstrated his love for you
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.440]   and while you're still throbbing in your insecurity
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.720]   and in your reaching after things,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.920]   meaning taking God-given things
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.520]   and using them in a God-forbidden way
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.760]   and having legitimate needs that God gave you
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.400]   met in an illegitimate way
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.360]   that doesn't bring a blessing to you but guilt and shame,
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.080]   God's trying to rescue you from that
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.040]   and set your mind right
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.960]   and tell you that there's grace there at the cross
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.200]   and then begin to let you use those things
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.180]   in a way that is life-giving
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.920]   and is gonna be caring for your soul
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.640]   and not destructive to your soul.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.700]   He says when you teach people the goodness of God
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.080]   and how to know him by grace through faith
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.280]   and walk with him and use all the beauty
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.500]   of God's creation well,
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.720]   then it says in that moment
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.400]   you're a good servant of Jesus Christ
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.660]   because God loves people.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.940]   People that are gonna then constantly nourish others
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.940]   in the words of the faith and on the sound doctrine
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.180]   which you have been following.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.180]   But watch this, have nothing to do with worldly fables.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.660]   The way that seems right to man
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.020]   but in the end it leads to death.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.740]   Fit only for old women speculating and gossiping
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.160]   and bittering, Paul would say,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.340]   but on the other hand, watch this,
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.180]   discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:16.940]   For bodily discipline is only of little profit.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.860]   But godliness is profitable for all things.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.740]   It's the most promise for this present life
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.400]   and the life to come.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.940]   Let me just give you the first little point
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.980]   I want you guys to get tonight
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.480]   and that is that as a person who cares for yourself,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.740]   okay, it's okay, and we talked about this last week,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.500]   it's okay to eat right and to exercise, you should,
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.220]   but when you obsess about your physical appearance,
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.840]   it's because you're hurting.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.660]   When you take food that God has given you
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.020]   and you binge on it for comfort reasons,
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.420]   it's because you're hurting.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.740]   When you live to eat instead of eat to live,
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.500]   it's because you're hurting.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.300]   Life is more than food and clothing.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.160]   And God loves you and he wants you to enjoy food,
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.320]   but he doesn't want you to be ruled by food.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.700]   He doesn't want you to be ruled by exercise.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.500]   When you see somebody, this is just a warning,
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.340]   when you see somebody that is so sharp
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.460]   and so put together that it looks like
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.180]   they might be the most important thing in their world,
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.620]   chances are it's because they and their body
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.060]   is the most important thing in their world
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.340]   and they do not a good life mate make.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:29.140]   It's a fact that you should spend more time
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.800]   on your inside than your outside.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.820]   More time on your inside than your outside.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.780]   Now this is a lot easier to say than it is to do,
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.020]   but let me just say one of the things
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.780]   that I do to care for my soul
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.180]   is I have just regular daily Bible intake.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.780]   One of the things we did here a number of years ago
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.820]   is we decided to help people with that.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.800]   So we created this thing called Join the Journey.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.980]   Join this journey through God's word with us
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.360]   as we try and figure out more who this God is
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.120]   that loves us and isn't asking us to perform for him,
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.340]   but is asking us to understand his provision for us.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.040]   And so we created something called Join the Journey.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.260]   If you've never heard of it before,
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.940]   there's an app online, Join the Journey.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.300]   Just download that thing and every single day
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.660]   we will send you a short 300 word devotional.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.040]   We'll have a little scripture right there
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.880]   that is on the app.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.740]   Just hit the play button, you can listen to it as you drive.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.960]   Then you can go back and read it right there in the app.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.540]   There's a little devotional question right there,
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.420]   a central truth that takes away from the passage,
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.120]   and then just some application questions,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.960]   and then check this out.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.980]   If you're confused by something you read,
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.840]   you can go right there on the app and just type in
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.620]   and say, man, this confused me.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.800]   I don't understand what this means.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.760]   It wasn't really addressed in the 300 word devotional.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.840]   And people will respond personally to you.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.400]   I was in Join the Journey today, all right?
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.240]   And we're reading right now just in the book of Genesis.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.140]   And I was reading the story of Joseph.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.680]   Now, if you don't know much about the story of Joseph,
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.460]   Joseph is a historical figure,
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.080]   but he's what's called a type of Christ.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.000]   In other words, he anticipates the provision
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.040]   that God was later going to provide people
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.100]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.320]   He's a picture of that.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.920]   So let me tell you the story of Joseph.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.560]   Joseph is there, his brothers are jealous of him.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   He knows that God is using him in a unique way.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.480]   He knows that one day he will provide life
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.320]   for his brothers.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.920]   His brothers don't like hearing that,
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.920]   so they reject him and they leave him
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.720]   after they beat him for dead.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.320]   They think he's dead, but in fact, he's not dead.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.920]   And what they intended for evil,
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.680]   God is going to use for good.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.440]   And he puts Joseph ultimately in a place
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.360]   where he's ascended to the right hand
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.840]   of the most sovereign of all,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.400]   to where the brothers then come to their poverty and need.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.320]   They go to avail themselves, to ask for grace,
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   only to find out that the one that is there
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.760]   that they need grace from is the one
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.800]   that they betrayed and left for dead.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.600]   But what they intended for evil,
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.100]   God was going to use for good.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.520]   That story sound familiar?
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.640]   That he came into his own and his own received him not,
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.680]   and they beat him and left him for dead,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.660]   and they didn't know that he was God's provision,
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.280]   and even though he told them he was God's provision,
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.760]   they rejected that idea.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.160]   And then instead of being mad at those that beat him,
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.200]   he says, "Father, forgive them,
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.260]   "for they don't know what they're doing,
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.200]   "what they intended for evil, I'm going to use for good."
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.960]   What kind of God does that?
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.160]   Well, the God of Joseph.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.280]   God who is Jesus.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.640]   But this is what was so interesting,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.600]   when I was reading about this today,
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.520]   and in Genesis 39, verse six, it says this,
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   "So he," meaning the leader and Pharaoh,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.640]   "left everything he owned in Joseph's charge,
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.480]   "and with him, he did not concern himself
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.300]   "with anything except the food which he ate."
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.860]   And then it makes this observation, it says,
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.600]   "Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance."
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.160]   A little bit later, and actually,
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.000]   it's talking about Potiphar here,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.840]   not Pharaoh at this point in the story,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.980]   we find out that Potiphar's wife agreed with Moses
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.440]   when he wrote that Joseph was handsome
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.560]   in form and appearance,
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.120]   'cause she went after this bad boy, all right?
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.480]   Kept kind of throwing herself at him,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.160]   and eventually one day, when he was alone in the house,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.280]   and nobody else was there, she came at him,
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.220]   and when he just resisted, and he fled immorality,
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.720]   this good man, she grabbed his cloak,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.800]   and then when he left out, she was embarrassed and ashamed,
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.400]   and so she screamed rape.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.920]   And she held his coat and would not be consoled
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.360]   until her master, her husband, came home,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.920]   the scripture says, and she said,
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.320]   "That Hebrew slave that you have here in our house,
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.800]   "he tried to rape me, and Joseph was thrown in jail."
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.040]   But God was at work in the midst of all that,
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.160]   and you need to go read the story,
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.040]   'cause it's an amazing story.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.800]   But when God made Joseph, it says he made him this way.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.760]   Now what's so interesting is that when Jesus came,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.660]   this is the prophecy about who Jesus would be.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.560]   Isaiah chapter 53, verse two,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.560]   really verses two down through 13,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.900]   have the clearest picture of the work of the coming Messiah
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.480]   that Joseph is gonna be a picture of,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.120]   and this is what it says about this one that would come
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.440]   that would take away the sins of the people,
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.800]   it says, "He grew up before us like a tender shoot,
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.680]   "and like a root out of parched ground."
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.960]   In other words, not a really strong tree,
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.280]   really strong shoot, 'cause it comes out
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.480]   of not real rich soil.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.080]   He had no stately form or majesty
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.640]   that we should look upon him,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.140]   nor appearance that we should be attracted to him.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.400]   When this Messiah, the one who's gonna save the world,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.040]   comes, he will be despised and forsaken of men.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   He'll be a man of sorrows acquainted with grief,
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.840]   and like from one who men hide their face,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.480]   he's despised and people, someone we did not esteem.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.320]   This is amazing.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.580]   I want you to think about this for a second.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.060]   You're God, you can come on earth,
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.120]   and any way you want, you reveal yourself.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.860]   What kind of body are you gonna give yourself?
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.800]   What kind of look are you gonna have?
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.160]   'Cause it's so easy to tell people what matters
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.680]   is not the outside but the inside,
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.800]   but when you got a chance to go,
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.080]   okay, well, I'm gonna go down there and roll for 33 years,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.480]   and I'm gonna let 'em beat the crap out of me
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.920]   and nail me to a cross, so I may as well look good
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.820]   when I'm stripped naked hanging there.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:11.040]   I would go fair, all right, it's fair.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.840]   Throw Aquaman on the cross, that would make sense to me.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.040]   It's not what he did,
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.940]   because there was something else
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.280]   that allowed him to go to a cross,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.900]   and when people betrayed him and beat him,
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.940]   to say, "Father, forgive them,
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.640]   "for they know not what they did."
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.920]   This is so interesting, when God is talking to Samuel
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.720]   and telling Samuel to appoint a king,
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.320]   in 1 Samuel 16, seven, this is what he says.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.360]   He says, "But the Lord said to Samuel,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   "don't look at his appearance
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.480]   "or at the height of his stature,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.320]   "'cause I've rejected him."
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.480]   Right now, at that age, David, at this point,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.000]   wasn't this impressive individual.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.960]   We're gonna find out a little bit later,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.920]   David was an attractive man, but at this point,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.960]   he said, "Don't look for great stature.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.520]   "For God sees not as man sees.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.200]   "For a man looks at the outward appearance,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.520]   "but the Lord looks at the heart."
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.560]   Hey, it's okay to be pretty and handsome.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.040]   But you better make sure that what's inside is really right.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.120]   Man, charm is deceitful and beauty is vain.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.280]   Bodies deteriorate.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.400]   Persons develop.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.760]   One of the biggest mistakes that we make
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.800]   at the age many of us in this room are,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.920]   is that we go just totally swayed by the outward appearance
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.240]   and that outward appearance is gonna change.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.000]   Let me just tell you something, bodies deteriorate,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.840]   but persons develop.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.800]   And you wanna marry somebody that is committed
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.120]   to the outward appearance,
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.640]   you wanna marry somebody that is committed
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.800]   to becoming more beautiful as they age.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.120]   I don't care how much they nip and tuck,
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   mother nature will win.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.760]   But I'm gonna also encourage you when you go to the Father
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.880]   who loves us and seek Him,
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.560]   you become more beautiful every day.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.920]   Charm is deceitful, beauty is vain,
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.720]   but a person who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.160]   Let me just give you something.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.800]   It's so interesting, I'm just gonna walk you through
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.240]   just a couple of points here real quick
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.800]   and I'm gonna get to kind of the main heart
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.880]   of our message very quickly, but here's just a few things.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.720]   Right now, when we're kind of in our 20s,
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.960]   some of us aren't taking care of our physical body
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.120]   and you can get away with it.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.640]   I mean, my kids have said this to me.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   I now got kids that are in this room, all right?
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.480]   And I gotta tell you how many times they looked at me,
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.320]   go, "Oh man, when I'm your age, I guarantee you,
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.480]   "I'm still gonna be able to throw it down and dump."
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.120]   I go, "Uh-huh, all right, I'm writing that down right now."
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.040]   All right?
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.760]   And I just watch them, you know?
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.360]   When you're 18 to 26, I don't care if you just,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.080]   you know, if you think a Cheeto's a carrot
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.880]   and you eat it all day long,
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.360]   your metabolism is just chewing everything up
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.600]   and you just look good in the family photo
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.760]   with your shirt always off, right?
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.880]   But here's the thing.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.000]   You don't realize that you're developing patterns
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.880]   and you don't realize that that metabolism
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.780]   is not always gonna fire at that rate.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.520]   And it's just a fact that practicing disobedience
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.280]   in our life without immediate consequence,
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.160]   it's the fastest way to grow bolder in disobedience
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.760]   in the future when you won't have much margin for error
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.600]   later.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.080]   It's why you wanna discipline your body right now
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.640]   and not make it your master,
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.720]   but you wanna learn right now in your youth
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.320]   and in your strength to conduct yourself
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.720]   in a way that's gonna be a blessing your whole entire life.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.640]   But let me just say this.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.280]   Spiritually, this is true too.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.480]   Practicing disobedience right now in your spiritual life
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.160]   without immediate consequence is the fastest way
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.400]   to grow bolder in your disobedience in the future.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.320]   In other words, some of you guys are out there
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.840]   and you're like, hey man, I've not really been walking
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.240]   with God, not really seeking God,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   and it hasn't really messed with me too much yet,
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.760]   but let me just tell you what we say here all the time.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.960]   And that is that we don't find people who get married
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.160]   who really have marriage problems.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.800]   We find out that they got single people problems
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.640]   that they just dragged into marriage.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.360]   So many folks are still under the illusion, man,
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.560]   that pornography is a single man's problem.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.080]   So many people are still under the illusion
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.880]   that they can just flip a switch one day
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.840]   and stop thinking the way they do
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.940]   about the way that a man should conduct himself,
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.560]   a woman should conduct herself, and that flip doesn't switch.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.160]   That switch doesn't flip.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.880]   I say that backwards all the time.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.480]   I heard it.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.800]   That switch doesn't flip just quite as easily as we think.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.440]   The scripture says this in Ecclesiastes 8, verse 11.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.280]   Watch this.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.920]   Because the sentence against an evil deed
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.000]   is not executed quickly,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.960]   therefore the hearts of men and women among them
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.480]   are given fully to do evil.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.560]   Now here's what's crazy is that God comes up
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.920]   against men and women who are committed to do evil,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.800]   and he's trying to make himself known because he loves you.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.480]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.000]   God's not mad at you in your lack of self-care.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.520]   He sees you throbbing.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.040]   He sees you reaching after things that are no gods at all
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.400]   and trying to make them gods,
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.800]   and not seeing that they can be used properly
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.320]   when you see them for who God created,
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.920]   what God created them to be.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.600]   Instead, you're making them something that they're not,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.640]   and they're hurting you because you're misusing that gift,
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.000]   that chainsaw which would make your life easier.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   You're using his dental floss,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.420]   and you have the scars to prove it.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.720]   He's not mad at you, man.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.760]   He just loves you.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.200]   And he just says, you know, you like what you got,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.040]   then keep doing what you're doing.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.880]   But if you keep doing what you're doing,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.600]   you're not gonna like what you got.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.640]   Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.960]   Then come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.040]   and I'll give you rest.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.440]   God is committed to making himself known.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   This is what the scripture says
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.840]   in Revelations chapter three, verse 20.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.760]   Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.640]   This is encouraging to me.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.400]   God is more anxious to know me and to seek me
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.480]   than I will ever be to know, want to know him or seek him.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.580]   Is that not amazing?
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.120]   You don't gotta hire some sherpa
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.800]   and get some yak and find the right mountain
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.900]   in the Nepalese mountain range
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.920]   and make your way up a hill and find the right cave
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.560]   where some swami is gonna impart to you
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.340]   a little bit of information that might help you.
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.680]   God has come.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.680]   And he's told you he loves you, and he's made himself known.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.160]   And he's standing at the door and knocking,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.400]   and he says, if you hear my voice and open the door,
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.360]   I will come into them and dine with him and he with me.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.980]   God's committed to make himself known.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.640]   Those who seek him will know him.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.520]   Seek and you'll find.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.280]   I'm not hiding, I'm right here.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.360]   And those who know him will learn to live for him.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.520]   See, here's the thing.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.600]   I am not performing that God might accept me.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.520]   I see the way God accepts me and loves me,
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.680]   and I am trying to respond to that.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.800]   Why wouldn't I move towards the God who loves me so much
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   that in my forsaking him, he rescued me?
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.020]   The scripture says this in Romans 8.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.020]   It says, he who did not spare his own son,
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.660]   but delivered him up for us all,
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.900]   how will he not also give us everything else that we need?
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.020]   It's just the logic of, look, he left the comfort of heaven.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.540]   Though he was rich, for your sake he became poor,
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.020]   so that in your poverty you might become rich.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.500]   A God that will do that.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:09.380]   Do you think this is just some kind of setup?
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.400]   You think it's a shell game?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.000]   You think it's a bait and switch?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.080]   Hey, here's what we'll do.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.400]   We'll go die for them, and then when they love us,
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.480]   we'll jack with them.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.440]   It's not the program.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.320]   He's trying to bring you home in a way
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.160]   that doesn't in any way diminish his character,
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.000]   'cause make no mistake,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.140]   God will always not let the guilty go punished.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.720]   But so that you may not be among the guilty,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.780]   he has brought you out of judgment into life.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.100]   It's who God is.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.500]   And those who know him will begin to seek him.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.660]   And living for him means dying to yourself.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.020]   And dying to yourself is the hardest discipline.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.260]   It's the hardest discipline.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.300]   But spiritual disciplines,
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.740]   it's the way that you go about learning more of God.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.500]   Spiritual disciplines are what enable us to live for him.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.540]   To live in a way that will lead to blessing.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.480]   And what I wanna just spend some time talking to you about
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.680]   is what this idea of self-care is
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.200]   through what's called spiritual discipline.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.880]   Spiritual disciplines get a bad rap, right?
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.920]   We think spiritual disciplines are these things that we do,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.140]   and they're not so much things we do
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.280]   as they are things that do something to us.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.400]   What's the something?
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.220]   Think of this.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.800]   God is light and life and love.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.040]   And so when you discipline yourself to spend more time
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.940]   with a God who is light and life and love,
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.340]   you're going to get more light in your life,
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.160]   more love in your life,
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.360]   and less darkness and despair.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.600]   Spiritual disciplines are not.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.800]   Let me just walk you through this.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.000]   Because when you hear the word discipline,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.900]   we immediately kinda go, man, I don't like that.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.560]   I don't wanna discipline myself.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.280]   Well, you do, right?
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.480]   Because discipline is the heavy door that leads to freedom.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.480]   Spiritual disciplines are not a spiritual to-do list
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.320]   of activities that will make us love God more.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.380]   They don't make us love God more.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.200]   It's what we do because we see that God is love.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.040]   I do these things because I wanna move towards the God
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.460]   who gives grace and glory.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.760]   I wanna move towards the God
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.120]   who's got my best interests in mind.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.840]   I wanna move to the God
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.040]   who's gonna let sex be a blessing to me.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.640]   I wanna move toward the God
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.080]   who's gonna show me how to operate in this world
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.160]   and sanctify everything by the word of God
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.440]   and by intimacy with him,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.840]   'cause he's the divine creator.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.080]   Spiritual disciplines are not a spiritual to-do list
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.920]   of activities that make us love God more.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.480]   They're not a way to show our love for God.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.020]   We don't show God our love
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.240]   through the spiritual disciplines.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.520]   We show God our love by having been intimate with him,
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.760]   living the way that it delights to see,
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.080]   that he delights to see us live.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.380]   There is no greater joy
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.160]   than to watch your children walking in the truth,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.800]   not because I can be like some amazing parent
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.280]   in the eyes of everybody else,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.160]   but because I love it when my kids are blessed.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.000]   I love when my kids are doing things
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.900]   that don't destroy their life.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.480]   Spiritual disciplines, watch this,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.980]   are not an unrealistic activity
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.360]   designed only for the spiritually elite and well-educated.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.440]   That's not what they are.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:37.680]   You guys know the whole Peloton craze that's out there?
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.920]   The Peloton craze is,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.680]   what's crazy about the Peloton craze
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.120]   is just not how much it costs,
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.960]   but isn't that 40 bucks a month
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.040]   that you gotta just keep on giving and keep on giving?
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.020]   But have you ever looked at a Peloton ad?
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.560]   There was a great thing that literally just last month,
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.240]   somebody jumped on Twitter
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   and started to make some observations about Peloton ads,
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.600]   about people who use Peloton.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   And here's just a series of them.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.960]   They put these pictures up there,
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   and the guy just said this,
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.720]   hey, I had my carpenter build a $9,000 finished wood riser
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.800]   for my Peloton bike
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.180]   in my glass-enclosed Zen garden home gym.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.860]   Every time you see a Peloton ad,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.200]   it's always these supremely,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.240]   like these people who just won the CrossFit championships
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.960]   for four years in a row,
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.680]   living in some unbelievable spot.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.240]   Here's one, hey, a good place for you
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.200]   to ride your Peloton bike is between your kitchen,
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.000]   no, sorry, I put my Peloton bike in the center,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.480]   this is the one in New York,
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.920]   I put my Peloton bike in the center
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.600]   of a panoramic living room
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.800]   in my window in my New York penthouse.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.480]   I like this one, a good place for your Peloton bike
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.240]   is between your kitchen and your living room,
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.920]   facing the cactus garden
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.480]   so you can always remember your virtual spin class.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.240]   How about this one?
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.560]   I took my Peloton bike to Europe
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.960]   to use it on the balcony of our $2,000 a night aired B&B.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.440]   And honestly, I felt like I was flying over London,
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.380]   you should buy one.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.440]   This is my favorite right here, this one.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.960]   Sometimes I move the Peloton bike into our gallery
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.200]   so I can spend time with my metrosexual husband
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.000]   while he reads Architectural Digest wearing combat boots.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.760]   It's hilarious.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.000]   My bright and airy sunroom is a great place
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.840]   for the Peloton bike,
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.280]   I leave the Arcadia door ajar
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.480]   so I actually feel like I'm riding a bicycle.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.160]   My Peloton is in the living room
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.480]   because it's my favorite work of art
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.260]   aside from the turquoise marble peacock
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.720]   I keep in the fireplace.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.240]   In the mornings after my housekeeper
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.320]   meticulously makes my bed,
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.820]   I like to ride my Peloton bike
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.920]   in the window of my high rise
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   and literally look down my nose at people.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   So funny.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.960]   I'll skip to the last one here.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.120]   I put the Peloton bike in the kitchen of our loft
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.040]   so I can get a workout
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.120]   and also cook the vegan three bean tortilla soup
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.200]   I downloaded from Goop.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.960]   I just, these crack me up.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.200]   Sometimes when you look at these Peloton ads like this,
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.560]   it's like man, the Peloton is only for really beautiful,
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.520]   fit, rich people who can make like a $9,000,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   you know, handcrafted wood mount for their Peloton bike.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.280]   Sometimes I think we have this mindset
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.560]   that the spiritual disciplines are only for people
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   like with names like Spurgeon and Edwards.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.760]   And they're not.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.880]   That's not what they are.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.840]   They're the means of life for all of us.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.800]   They're not legalistic activities
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.000]   to make us feel guilty about what we're not doing.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.920]   Spiritual disciplines are not things we do
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.080]   so we can look spiritual to others.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.200]   This is so important.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.480]   We're not spiritual narcissists.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.560]   We don't become people who are conformed to the image of God
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.680]   so that people can go, wow, you're really godly.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.320]   No, what the Lord does for us is never just for us.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.240]   Remember what I said?
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.560]   The reason you care for yourself,
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.440]   the reason you want the blessing of God
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.640]   is so that you can be a blessing.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.760]   That was God's program from the beginning.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.480]   From the very first time he developed
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.800]   and pursued a relationship with a man.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.120]   He said, I'm gonna bless the world through you
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   because you've got a relationship with me.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   The goal is not that we do the spiritual disciplines
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.920]   or soul care.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.840]   The goal is that we have intimacy with God.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.720]   Why does God want us to have intimacy with him?
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.560]   Because he's the God who gives grace and glory
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.800]   and because he loves you.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.520]   He's not looking for you to read your Bible
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.360]   so you can read your Bible.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.520]   He's looking for you to read your Bible
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.320]   because that's where your loving heavenly father speaks.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:25.760]   And he wants to encourage you to walk in the paths of life.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.720]   The ancient path, where the good way is.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   This is what spiritual discipline is.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.120]   This is what soul care is.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.440]   It's a means of grace so that we can receive life
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.960]   from our loving father.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.200]   It's how we get near Jesus, right?
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.440]   If Jesus was alive, if I told you guys
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.360]   that you could spend time with Jesus, what would you do?
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.560]   You'd wanna go everywhere he goes.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.240]   You'd wanna listen to him speak.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.440]   And what's so amazing is that the priorities
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.240]   and the habits of a disciple today
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.120]   are the exact same as they were 2,000 years ago.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:02.840]   Except that we don't have to wait in line
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.560]   'cause it's not just one physical embodiment of God.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.880]   Now we've been brought near to him
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.560]   through the provision of Jesus Christ
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.000]   and we can have intimacy with our father
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.080]   and we can come boldly before the throne of grace
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.600]   and he's recorded the messages that Jesus gave
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.440]   and he lives and speaks to us in the context of prayer,
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.000]   rightly understood, promptings that the spirit will give us
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.680]   always as informed by scripture.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.320]   Jesus practiced the spiritual disciplines when he was here.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.160]   Why?
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.880]   Because when he came, he never denied the fact
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.660]   that he was God, he never stopped being God,
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.560]   but he didn't grasp onto that.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.720]   That's not the way he got through life.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.160]   He identified with you and me.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.880]   And so again and again, you'll see these things.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.800]   Like in Mark chapter one, verse 35,
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.240]   it says in the early morning, while it was still dark,
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.360]   Jesus would get up and he'd leave other people,
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.160]   he'd leave the house, he'd go to a secluded place
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.800]   and he would spend time with the father.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.140]   He would just say, Lord, remind me of your love for people.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:03.140]   Remind me, why I wanna maintain the identity with humanity
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.320]   and not just on my own start acting like God
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   but depend upon you to give me insight,
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.100]   to let the spirit of God use me to do amazing things.
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.280]   But what happens is so many of us,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.840]   we just try to live like Jesus wants us to live.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.240]   And we don't do the things to care for our spiritual heart
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.360]   and our spiritual center so we can't.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   There is a world of difference between trying and training.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.320]   Trying is a flawed strategy.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.820]   There's a huge difference between being wanting
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.240]   and being willing.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:41.200]   And I just wanna encourage you guys with this.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.880]   You're never gonna want to be closer to God
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.780]   than he's gonna wanna be close to you.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.760]   Let me ask you three questions, are you ready?
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.660]   Do you wanna be a godly man or a woman?
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.320]   I mean, just ask yourself that.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.980]   If you could be the glory that God intended humankind to be,
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.400]   do you wanna be that?
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   Second question, are you a godly man or woman?
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.760]   Right now, are you a godly man,
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.820]   are you a godly woman?
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:16.520]   Now, if the answer to their first question was yes,
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.800]   and the answer to your second question was no,
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.900]   it's because you answered the first question wrong.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.140]   Because here's the third question,
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.800]   does God want you to be a godly man or a godly woman?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.520]   You bet he does.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.800]   So if God wants you to, and you say you want to,
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.640]   why aren't you?
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.280]   And the answer is because so many of us say we want to
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.640]   and we try to, but we don't do the thing
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.280]   that will allow us to find the healing and the strength
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.960]   that God wants us to find.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.280]   This is Proverbs 13, verse four.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.480]   The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.160]   In other words, the soul of the sluggard
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.120]   wants everything that the soul of the diligent wants,
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.400]   but the soul of the diligent actually gets
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.120]   what the sluggard only wants.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.600]   Proverbs 13, four.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.640]   The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.260]   but the soul of the diligent is made fat.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.200]   Do you want to be a godly man?
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.040]   Yes, Todd.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.780]   Are you a godly person?
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.320]   Or second question would be,
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.800]   does God want you to be a godly person?
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.640]   Yes.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.460]   Are you a godly person?
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.300]   No.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.120]   And it's because you answered that first question wrong.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.280]   God is committed to conforming you into the image
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.240]   of his son, and the way that you're gonna get there
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.680]   is by spending time with him.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.160]   So many people talk about how hard
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.480]   the spiritual disciplines are,
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.560]   and the truth is that embracing the spiritual disciplines
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.440]   is freedom.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.180]   Freedom is the reward of discipline.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.280]   I had a good friend when I grew up,
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.720]   one of my best friends growing up,
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.880]   was a guy that when we were all out doing what 12 and 11
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.200]   and 13 year olds did, his mom would whistle him in,
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.720]   and he would always have to go and go and practice tennis.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.360]   A little bit later, my friend had the freedom
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.320]   to win Wimbledon.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.520]   My friend had the freedom to win a US Open.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.920]   My friend had the freedom to win the Australian Open.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.560]   My friend had the freedom to win the French Open.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.360]   My friend had a freedom to be the first American
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.240]   to win a gold medal in tennis,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.840]   because he disciplined himself
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.760]   to be an amazing tennis player.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.680]   I played tennis with him on the same high school team.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.480]   I just didn't play tennis all the time like he did.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.720]   I was a typical kid who kind of dabbled in it
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.760]   and went my way, and I didn't have the freedom
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.120]   to keep competing.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.360]   Freedom comes through discipline.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.440]   Discipline and self-care is the heavy practice
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.360]   of diligence that leads to what it is that we all want.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.000]   So how do we practice it?
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.760]   How are we supposed to practice these things?
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.880]   And I would just say this.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   You wanna do it patiently with yourself.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.120]   Be a little patient with yourself.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.080]   You don't grow spiritually mature overnight.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.840]   Most of us overestimate what we can do in a week.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.720]   But we underestimate what God can do in our life in a year.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.760]   And so I would encourage you just to start simply
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.960]   and simply start.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:09.120]   The way you practice the disciplines
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.400]   is just on a long, steady life of pursuit.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.720]   You don't grow up overnight.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   You can't will yourself to be more godly.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.080]   It just takes patience and endurance and steadfastness.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.160]   Start simply and simply start.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.400]   Secondly, not just patiently, but do it continually.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.760]   Just continually.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:34.560]   The spiritual disciplines are not separated
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.920]   from our daily lives.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.040]   It's not something we do for 30 minutes
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.400]   and then we just move on.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.880]   Jesus says, "Follow me."
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.200]   That's a continual action.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.680]   Jesus says, "Abide with me."
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.920]   That means remain in constant conversation with me.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.000]   Jesus says, "Don't just read the Bible,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.600]   "but meditate on it, memorize it.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.960]   "Make sure it doesn't depart from your mouth."
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.640]   Jesus says, "Get around other people
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.960]   "that will encourage you."
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.320]   We do it patiently and we do it continually.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.960]   It's a fact that if we sow a thought,
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.760]   we're gonna eventually reap an action.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.520]   If we sow an action, we're gonna eventually reap a habit.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.360]   If we sow a habit, we're gonna eventually reap a character.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.320]   If we sow a character,
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.160]   eventually we're gonna reap a destiny.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.760]   And so the thought that is in your mind day by day
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.160]   ought to be, "God is good and kind and gracious
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.680]   "and I don't wanna miss him."
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.080]   People think about the cost of discipleship being so heavy,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.320]   but we forget what the cost of non-discipleship is.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   Listen to this statement.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.160]   Here's the cost of not knowing the God
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.440]   who gives grace and glory.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.960]   Not knowing the God who makes you
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.320]   and restores the glory that he intended for you.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.600]   Non-discipleship costs abiding peace.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.920]   Anybody here struggle with anxiety?
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.200]   Non-discipleship creates a life
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.040]   penetrated throughout without love.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.400]   Without faith that sees everything in the light
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.000]   of God's overriding governance for good hopefulness
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.960]   that stands firm in the most discouraging of circumstances.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.320]   Power to do what is right
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.560]   and withstand the forces of evil.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.120]   Non-disciples don't have that.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.800]   In short, it costs exactly the same abundance of life
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.360]   that Jesus said he came to bring.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.680]   The cross-shaped yoke of Christ
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.120]   is after all an instrument of liberation.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.440]   And power to correct perspective
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   is to see following Christ
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.400]   not only as the necessity it is,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.040]   but the fulfillment of the highest human possibility
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.760]   and his life on the highest plane.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.200]   The cost of non-discipleship means
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   that you lose the freedom to lead yourself
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.840]   and eventually one day lead a family
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.600]   in a way that's gonna lead to blessing.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.120]   The cost of non-discipleship and self-care
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.280]   is the inability to resist temptation.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.440]   To use scripture in a way
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.640]   that would bring strength to your life
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.440]   and then grace to the life of others.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.120]   And God's saying, "Can I help you?"
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.760]   We do it patiently, we do it consistently,
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.080]   and we also don't do it alone.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.640]   We say here all the time
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.280]   that if you don't change your playground
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.880]   where you're kind of hanging around all the time
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.600]   and what is the activity of your life,
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.600]   it's not gonna go well with you.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.800]   So you gotta change your playground,
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.880]   you gotta change what you're sowing into your life
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.160]   in terms of what your thought is.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.360]   And you gotta pay attention
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.200]   to what God said is gonna be life-giving.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.640]   You can't go and eat,
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   we say this all the time, right?
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.680]   You don't just sit there and take a Cheeto and eat it
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.080]   and while you're saying,
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.760]   "God, would you please change the molecular structure
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.100]   "of this Cheeto into a carrot
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.760]   "as I take it down and swallow it?"
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.920]   That can be a fervent prayer,
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.400]   it's just not the way God works.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.000]   He's like, "No, put the Cheeto down and grab a carrot."
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.040]   Quit binge-watching Game of Thrones
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.440]   and approach the throne of grace.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:44.680]   When I was in my 20s, about your age,
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.160]   I'd played sports my whole life, I was an athlete.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.680]   I wasn't a guy that was such a non-athlete
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.920]   that my sport was just to run in a long straight line
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.140]   until everybody collapsed, okay?
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.600]   I would make fun of my friends that were runners.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.700]   But then this whole craze started sweeping the country
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.820]   and it was 10K races.
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.300]   I had no idea what 10K was.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.140]   I thought 10,000 steps, who can't run 10,000 steps?
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.100]   And so my friends go, "Wagner, you couldn't run a 10K
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.660]   "in any kind of time that was reasonable."
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.380]   I go, "Oh yes, I could."
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.540]   "How, what's a reasonable time?"
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.360]   They go, "I don't know,"
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.460]   and they kind of figured it out in their mind
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.980]   and they go, "Well, an eight-minute mile
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.940]   "is not a terrible mile,
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.720]   "but let's just say it's gonna be
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.380]   "ah, like a seven-minute mile."
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.860]   And so they just did the math real quick in their head
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.380]   and said, "I bet you cannot run a 10K
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.460]   "in under 45 minutes."
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.540]   Like, "Well, how far is a 10K, 10,000 steps?
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.580]   "5,280 steps is a mile, I can run two miles in 45."
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.220]   They go, "It's 6.2 miles."
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.060]   But I was young and stupid and foolish.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.940]   I had never run more than a mile for time
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.340]   in the sports that I played.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.060]   And they go, "I can do that!"
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.260]   And they go, "I'll bet you dinner anywhere in Dallas
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.380]   "on the other guy's dime."
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.300]   I go, "Done."
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.180]   That was Thursday.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.700]   Saturday was the first 10K I was ever gonna run.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.180]   All I had was basketball shoes.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.160]   I played that sport longer than any other.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.420]   I put my basketball shoes on and go,
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.940]   "Okay, I'm gonna go run 3.1 miles
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.540]   "just to kinda see if I can do that in roughly 20 minutes,
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.340]   "and that'll give me a chance to have a little extra time
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.420]   "to finish the other ones."
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.020]   So in a pair of basketball shoes on Thursday
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.260]   about three o'clock in the afternoon,
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.800]   I went and ran 3.1 miles, and it wasn't in 20 minutes.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.820]   And I got home and I go, "This is not gonna work."
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:15.660]   I went to Luke's Locker,
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.020]   I bought my first ever pair of running shoes that night
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.000]   'cause I realized running in basketball shoes
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.180]   was not the way to do it.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.720]   And I got a friend, and I said,
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.740]   "Hey, I need you to help me."
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.660]   This guy was a runner.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.980]   I said, "I need you to pace me."
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:29.980]   Have you seen this?
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.860]   There's today, they didn't have this when I was running,
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.500]   but if you go run in marathons or 10Ks,
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.380]   you'll have people like this.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.780]   And what they are are folks
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.280]   that will mark how you're running, right?
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.540]   So if you wanna run the 10K in under 50 minutes,
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.500]   you follow the person that's running the 830 mile.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.620]   If you wanna run it in 45 minutes,
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.460]   you follow somebody else
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.980]   who runs another mile and a certain distance.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.500]   And there's different paces there
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.820]   that you can figure out how fast
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.660]   you're gonna run to run the race.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:01.980]   Well, let me just say this to you
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:05.260]   before I give you this last little closing illustration.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.560]   Some of my friends in their 26 to 27, 28 years old,
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.060]   when they decided to run their first 10K
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.260]   because they ran long distances
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.420]   when they were in high school
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.140]   and competed at four and a half or five minute miles,
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.780]   for them, eight years later,
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.700]   to run a six minute mile was no big deal
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.100]   because they had conditioned themselves
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.460]   at a young age to run.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.740]   I hadn't.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.300]   Basketball's a lot of short bursts.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.520]   Football's a lot of short bursts.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.300]   You just gotta make your time for a mile
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.140]   and then you're good.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.300]   I had never run that way before.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.260]   And so for me, all of a sudden,
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:37.700]   to run a seven minute mile six times in a row
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.900]   was not going to be easy.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.060]   I had had, in a 10K vernacular,
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.820]   I had the wrong playmates.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.860]   And we could do a lot of other things,
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.940]   but we could not run the way that we were gonna run
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.240]   if we're gonna pop off about how we could run.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.700]   Some of you guys are doing the same thing.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.020]   And you're around some people
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.660]   that are gonna kinda hold up, you know,
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.600]   eight minute and 30 second miles
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.700]   and your life is filled with anxiety.
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.380]   You know, you're gonna be around people
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.980]   who run 10 minute miles and you're addicted.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.940]   That's where this heads.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.660]   I mean, if the goal is to run a four minute mile,
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.100]   that's world class, that's a glorious mile,
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.540]   I mean, that's like world class,
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.260]   then you can't be hanging out with people who go,
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.720]   we're just gonna kinda skip through life
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.460]   and be church goers.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.100]   More moral than most, I mean, we're not invalids,
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.100]   but we're not glorious either.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.620]   We're people that are struggling with, you know,
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.140]   divorce later in our life,
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.780]   'cause this is, you know, a whole lot better than most,
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:37.020]   but man, there's a whole lot better,
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.500]   people that are a whole lot better than most,
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.940]   whose marriages are not what they dreamed about.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.100]   Not bad, right?
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.580]   But not life.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:52.120]   One of the reasons that my life, now a little bit later,
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.160]   doesn't look like some of these words
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.380]   is because when I was your age,
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.820]   I wasn't running 10Ks,
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:03.380]   but I was disciplining myself to run with Jesus.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.580]   And I gotta tell you, running the four minute mile
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.860]   of being what I would say, by the grace of God,
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.660]   was somebody who didn't binge watch Game of Thrones
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.200]   or Seinfeld or whatever the show was in the '80s,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.340]   but I binged on Matthew and Mark and Philippians
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.900]   and Colossians and Proverbs and Psalms.
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:27.780]   As I've run a four minute mile now for about 30 years,
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.060]   I'm just gonna tell you, it's the good way.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:35.460]   And when just some dinner anywhere that I want,
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.860]   I sit around my dinner table with a wife of my youth
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.800]   and she loves me and my kids respect me.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.460]   By and large, I'm a source of grace to my community.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.020]   Don't give the devil your youth.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.180]   Right now is the time to start running.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:53.300]   Right now, because you want to the rest of your life,
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.180]   maybe as life gets a little bit busier,
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.140]   you're never gonna have more time
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:58.580]   to see God than you do right now.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.820]   It doesn't get easier.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.860]   Use your good mind and your strength of days
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.580]   to cement your relationship with Christ.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.500]   It's what you wanna do.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.140]   The one who gives grace and glory, run to him.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.300]   The one who no good thing does he withhold
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.180]   from those who love him, run with him.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.780]   The one who is in presence is the fullness of joy.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.440]   In his right hand are pleasures forever.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.140]   The one who, it's the blessing of him that makes rich
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.320]   and he has no sorrow to it.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.940]   The one when you are humble before him and fear him,
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.220]   it leads to riches, honor, and life.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.940]   Right now, folks, is when you want
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.540]   to start running with Jesus.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:40.660]   This is a young man's God because he wants you
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:44.180]   to have not just provision for the other life,
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.580]   but godliness has great gain for this life also.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:52.100]   And I'm just telling you as a guy that learned to run
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:55.280]   with other people who were running four minute miles
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:59.460]   in my 20s, it's been a blessing for 30 years.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:05.180]   Father, I pray that my friends in this room
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.620]   would run hard right now, they would take care
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.820]   of themselves now, they wouldn't go,
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:13.340]   ah, it's not a big deal that I can't train right now
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:17.020]   because I'm young and young people can do 10Ks
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.020]   in decent time, the scars aren't there yet,
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:21.780]   the plaque hasn't filled their life yet, but it's coming.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:26.060]   It's coming, so I pray that they would right now, Lord,
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.540]   that they would start caring for their bodies
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.860]   and realizing that the way they're training now
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.960]   to walk with you and to know you is gonna be a blessing
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.740]   for the marathon that is the game of life.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.260]   And I pray they'd be patient with themselves.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.340]   I pray they would do it continually
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.240]   and I pray they wouldn't do it alone,
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.060]   that they would find other people here and in other places
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.220]   that are committed to running hard with you,
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:51.700]   running with Jesus so that there can be
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:55.940]   a group of men and women here that others can draft with
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.220]   and learn from and that they can be a source
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.980]   of grace, of life indeed.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.600]   Would you convince us, Father, that you're the God
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.800]   who gives grace and glory and would you help us start to run
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.600]   where there is life, in Jesus' name?
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:20.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
