[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   All right, well let's go! Welcome everybody in the room!
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Everybody tuning in wherever you are joining us from.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And I want to welcome PortsLive, Fort Worth, Midland, Indy, Boise.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   We are kicking off a brand new series, Anti-Suppressants.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   What does that mean? I'll explain in a second.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Let me read the text that we're going to be in tonight and then give us a little bit of a recent event in my life
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   that will set us up for where we're going really in this series.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   This comes from Matthew chapter 18. It's a conversation between Jesus and his disciples.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And here's what happens. Verse 21.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how often should I forgive someone who sins against me?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Up to seven times?' 'No, not seven times,' Jesus replied, 'but seventy times seven.'
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   'Therefore,'" and he launches into a parable or a story or an analogy to explain what he means.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   "'The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   with servants who had borrowed money from him.'"
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So he's got a lender, gave out some money, time to settle those debts.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   "'In the process, one of the debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   He couldn't pay, so his master ordered that he be sold, along with his wife, his children,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   everything he owed, to pay the debt.'"
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   That's a bad day.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   "'But the man fell down before the master and begged him, 'Please be patient with me. I will pay it all.'
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Then the master was filled with pity for him, or mercy, and he released him, and he forgave his debt.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   But when the man left the king, he went and found a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment.'"
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You better Venmo me right now.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   "'And his fellow servant fell down before him, and he begged for a little more time,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and he says the same thing to this man who just had his debt crossed out.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   'Be patient with me. I'll pay you back.'
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   But his creditor wouldn't wait.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He had the man arrested, put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   When some of the other servants saw this, they were upset.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   They went to the king and told him everything that happened.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The king called in the man.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   He had forgiven and said, 'You evil servant, I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Shouldn't you have shown mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?'
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid all of his entire debt.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And that's what it will be like with my heavenly father for those of you who refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters from your heart.'"
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   About a year ago, I got given a cooler as kind of a Christmas gift at Watermark one time a year.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Leadership will bust out and give something.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And it was a cooler, and I didn't have a cooler, especially not like, you know, Yeti coolers.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And this is like the poor man's version of the Yeti cooler, and that's the Arctic.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's supposedly as good as the knockoffs, but dude, I didn't care.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I needed a cooler, and so this is great.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And so a little bit of time went by, and my family and I, we went on a trip and went out to this friend's lake house,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   and we brought the cooler, loaded it up with food.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Everything's going great, great trip, come back home, unpack, move on with life.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Three months later, we're going to go on another trip.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I go out to the garage to get the cooler, going to load it back up with food.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I open up the cooler, and I had left meat for not three days or three weeks, but three months in that cooler.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And it was a smell, and I've got like half of my smell anyways back from COVID,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and it was a smell that was overwhelming despite that, and I was like, oh, my goodness.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So I take the meat out, and my new cooler that I was so excited about, I begin to go into, you know, solution mode.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   How am I going to get rid of this smell?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So I'm looking up on, you know, Googling, how do you get rid of, somebody said you take magazines and rip them up and throw them in there.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   That doesn't work at all.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I tried other solutions, you know, baking soda in there, washed it out multiple times, and to this day, nothing has worked.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It is horrible smelling, and so, yeah, people are going to throw out their solutions.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   We can talk afterwards, but the point is I left in this container something from the past, something from an event, and it contaminated it.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   In other words, in just a little bit of time, something that was left over from a past event was left inside,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and it led to impacting the future use of this cooler and contaminated it.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Now, what does that have to do with what we're going to talk about?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Well, our heart in this series is that in a very similar way that someone can leave something in a cooler,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and without removing that or dealing with it, over time, you're going to see, experience the effects of it.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   In a similar way, all of us are on a journey called life, and in the midst of life, there are certain events that happen,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and they leave something inside of not a cooler but of our heart and of our soul,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   and if they're not dealt with, they're going to contaminate and impact the future.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So our series in this series is to not suppress those things.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Everyone's familiar with antidepressants and people who've experienced a battle depression,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   and this is not about that at all. It's about antisuppressants, which is God's design for healing,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and part of the antisuppressant, in other words, that you would not suppress some of those events,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   some of the deep pain that you've experienced in life, and in order to do that, you can't suppress it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You've got to address it, and that's what we're going to walk through inside of this series,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   and I think God is going to do something in some of your lives that you're going to look back for the next 40 years,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   and it will be you applying God's Word as we're going to examine it from the Scripture.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   That's going to change the trajectory of your future marriage, the future parenting,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   the future life that you're going to have because of what he's going to do in this series.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Candidly, a few weeks ago, we had a night where we had this moment of talking about shame
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and how in Christ, we're free from anything defining us other than Jesus.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   If you're a Christian, whatever your story is, whatever your past sin, present sin, future sin,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   we're no longer defined by those shames, and we just had all of us write out on different index cards,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and we threw them in these boxes saying, "That doesn't define me anymore."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And our team, I told you, was going to go through and just pray over and pray that God would give you the freedom
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   to believe that and release that.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And as we went through and read them and just prayed over, it was very abundantly clear.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   The amount of pain, trauma, hurt that is represented in all of our stories.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And nobody in life often teaches us how do we deal with that.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You go through school and you learn how to do algebra, but nobody teaches you how do you deal with the fact
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   that your dad wasn't ever around.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   How do you deal with the fact that you had people make comments about you at a young age,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   and that created an insecurity that led to an eating disorder for years?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   How do you deal with the fact that you never got the affirmation from a parental figure in life,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   and so you've been looking for it anywhere you can find it, only to come up empty?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   How do you deal with big and small hurts?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And so tonight I want to talk about the conversation of forgiveness, and let me just open it up.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   This is such a huge topic and has such life-changing, trajectory-changing importance
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   that we're going to cover two weeks.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It just was too much to cover a high-level understanding of why we forgive as Christians,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   what it even means to forgive, which is what we're going to cover tonight,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   and then very practically how we're going to forgive.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So if you leave tonight and you're like, "Man, I feel like I kind of left something on the table,"
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   that's because this is a message that is broken down into two parts,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   where we're going to look through what God says about forgiving.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   But this message and the idea of forgiveness and the ability to forgive is going to shape your future marriage.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Candidly, the reason why some of you are going to end up not making it in marriage
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   or the relationship will fall apart is because you will not have put into practice
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   the ability to get rid of bitterness, to deal with hurts.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And so we're going to walk through, again, a powerful, profound teaching that Jesus gives,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   and tonight we're going to cover why we forgive and look at three reasons the Bible commands as Christians.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   If you're not Christian, man, this doesn't apply to you. You're welcome.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   We're so glad that you're here.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   But I'm talking very specifically to Christians who have been called by God to practice the habit of forgiveness.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   So I'm going to walk through these three things again that we see in Matthew 18
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   as we look at what Jesus' radical teaching on forgiveness says.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And it starts with Peter coming up to Jesus and asking him a question.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Remember the question before he launches into the story?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He says, "Lord, how many times, if somebody wrongs me,"
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I don't want to mean names or name names. I'm talking about James, John, Bartholomew.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   "If they wrong me, how many times do I forgive them?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Like, where's the line? When do I begin to go, 'Nope, uh-uh, out of my life, forget you, I'm done' up to seven times?"
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Now, my hunch is that Peter is saying this thinking, like, I'm patting myself on the back,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   that I would be so generous to do seven. Why do I say that?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Because rabbinic teaching or the teaching of the time was up to three times.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And Peter says, "I'm not just doing three. I'm going to double it, plus one.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   How do you like them apples? What do they look at me now?"
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And Jesus says, "No, Peter, not seven times. Seventy times seven times."
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   As in translation, there's no end to the call to forgive.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   The first reason that you and I are to forgive, or reason why, is because God has commanded it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And now, let me unpack exactly why that's important before I explain what forgiveness is.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Because the reason people balk at, "Oh, God commanded it. That feels so invalidating,"
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   is because you think that forgiving is forgetting or pretending it didn't happen.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   That's not what forgiveness is. In a second, we're going to talk about what it is.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   But first, I want to establish, if you were a follower of Jesus, and I mean a Christian,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   you are commanded to forgive continuously, to forgive when people sin against you.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   What do I say if you're a Christian?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Candidly, there's a lot of people who have the title of Christian.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   You may say, "Man, I'm a Christian."
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   But if you don't live out the lifestyle of forgiving, it may be that you are not a Christian.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Jesus, all throughout his teaching, says, "Hey, this is what's going to mark my people."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   In fact, when he teaches on prayer, he's like, "Here's how you should pray."
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name."
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   He goes through the Lord's Prayer.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Inside of the prayer that he says, "Here's how you pray.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Forgive us our debts as we forgive other people."
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That it's at the heart of following Jesus, is I am continually called to forgive people in my life.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   The first idea and the first reason is why, because Jesus commands it.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   When do I forgive?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Every time someone sins against you.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Here's what that means.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Every person around you right now, every person you've ever met, is a sinner.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Myself, your mom, every person here, everyone you've ever met is someone that is going to sin.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Jesus says, "There's no end."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   When you ask the question, "How many times do I allow the person who cut me off in the road,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   or the person who posted that thing on Instagram that I disagreed with,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   or how many times do I forgive my sibling, or how many times do I forgive my parents?"
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   How many times did Jesus say, "You never stop forgiving, that you are called to forgive continually."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   He's not saying to take abuse.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And I'll explain why I say that, which people hear because they don't understand what the Bible means
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   when it says forgiveness.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   There's a lot of misunderstanding about that.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   But I just want to establish up top that he calls us continuously to forgive.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   The co-worker that offended you, the friend that betrayed you, this is why cancel culture,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   the world around us, somebody says the wrong thing, mentions, posts the wrong thing, makes a mistake,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   you're canceled.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   For Christians, it's sin.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Because we're called to love people, and love bears all things, hopes all things,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   believes all things, endures all things.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And for the world around, cancel the latest person or whoever that is, man,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   that's just them fulfilling their job description.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   This is what people who don't know Jesus do.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   But for people who do, you and I are to be continuously forgiving, gracious,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   when people intentionally or unintentionally hurt us.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It's pretty radical teaching.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And if you're sitting there going, but you don't know my story, and you don't know what he did, I don't.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   But God does.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And he's the one who's commanding that.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And he's doing so because he loves you.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And I'll explain why I say that here in a second.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   But the first idea is that you and I are to continually forgive people.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And why this is really hard is because there are some real deep wounds here.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Some of you guys had your purity taken from you.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And it wasn't your fault.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   But it's now part of your reality.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And God is not saying that's right or his desire.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   But he has called all of us to forgive.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Some of you guys, like you just had bad parents.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And it wasn't right.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And your mom's still to this day like she's passive aggressive and your dad's controlling and they just weren't good parents.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And God didn't want that or desire that for you.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   But here's what you've got to know.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   You've got to forgive them.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   It's a part of you healing.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   The person who introduced you, maybe like me, to pornography at a young age, and that played a huge -- I mean, that shaped the next decade of my life.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And part of you experiencing freedom from that involves forgiving.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   In my house, from time to time, you know, vacuum up and everyone's seen -- there's the big vacuums and then there's hand-held vacuums.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And when you've got little kids, you just bust these out because it's a lot more convenient when they're constantly dropping Cheerios all the time.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And I've noticed something about these small hand-held vacuums.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   This small nozzle, and particularly like I said, when you're dealing with Cheez-Its and Goldfish and all of that, something will get lodged inside of it.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And you know what happens whenever you get something lodged, clogging up part of the suction on it?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It decreases the efficiency of the vacuum.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   In other words, it makes it less able to do the thing it was created to do.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Less able to operate it, its full potential.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And not only that, when something gets clogged in there, it doesn't just decrease its efficiency,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   it makes it more likely that something else is going to get clogged in there too and get stopped, unless you deal with it.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And in words that I will fail to communicate, my heart for you, just as somebody a little further down the road, is that you would deal with it.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   There are things that are getting lodged in, and to use that example,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   it's not only decreasing your potential to be all who God called you to be,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   it's also increasing the likelihood of other things getting lodged in your heart.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   In other words, you're more sensitive, you're more quick to be offended,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   you have more things that are getting lodged in there, because you haven't practiced the habit of forgiveness.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Whenever I do somebody's marriage, and from time to time people will ask and say, "Will you do our wedding?"
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   A question I ask every time two couples or a couple is in front of me,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   "Is there anyone that either of you have not forgiven?"
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And almost always, it's either, "No, we have," or it's apparent.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And I say as lovingly as I can, "I cannot do your wedding unless you forgive them."
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Why? Well, first, because God commands it, but also because I'm going to be a part of a wedding ceremony
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   where you two are going to promise to love and sacrifice and serve one another,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   and you hold bitterness in your heart, which makes you more likely to hold bitterness when he hurts you,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   or when she hurts you, because you know it's going to happen, right?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   That's what marriage is. It's two sinners coming together.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   As Billy Graham famously once said, "What makes a good marriage? Two great forgivers."
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And so if you haven't worked through and you're holding on to bitterness,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   it's only going to continue to show up in your life.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And God who loves you wants you to experience freedom from that.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   The first reason why is because we're commanded.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And then Jesus launches into this story, and it's a pretty profound story, but I'll recap as a reminder of it.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   He basically says, "Peter, let me tell you a story. It's like the kingdom of heaven.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   We're talking God's kingdom, ready?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   There was a man, king, had a lot of cash, lent it out to a bunch of people.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   One guy owed millions and millions and millions of dollars."
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   In fact, other translations hold it that it would have been closer to a billion dollars that this man was in debt.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   This guy had hit Vegas way too many times, and he's in debt hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And he goes and the king says, "Hey, time to pay up? Bring me my money."
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   The guy says, "Man, I can't pay it."
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   The king says, "All right, well, we're going to sell him, sell his house, his wife, his kids, sell the cat, sell it all.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   We're going to get that money back."
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   The guy throws himself at his feet and says, "Please, give me some time, I'll pay it."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   There's no amount of time where this guy could have ever paid that back.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And the king says, "You know what? I forgive you. I am having mercy on you."
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And the guy has got to be ecstatic.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I mean, this is like, this is a better day than every student loan or car note in this room, boom, gone.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   He's ecstatic, and he runs home, and he runs out.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   On his way home, after being forgiven hundreds of millions of dollars, he sees, you know, an old boy that owes him a few thousand.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   He's like, "Hey, hey, where's my money? Give me my money, give me my money."
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Grabs him by the throat.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And the guy says, "Just give me a little time."
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Now, the guy could have paid that debt back.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   But he says, "No time has him taken away, put in prison."
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And Jesus is saying that the king calls him in and says, "After the enormous forgiveness of your debt that I gave to you, you would not forgive him?
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   That's how you respond?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Then you're going to spend, trapped in that debt for the rest of your life."
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Now, what's the point that Jesus is making?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Because then he says, "Hey, this is, all of my followers will not act like this man."
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   The second reason why we forgive is because God has forgiven us.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   The second reason why, as Christians, you and I are called to forgive, and this one is the hardest to wrap our minds around, is because of the enormous debt.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   That's the point Jesus is making.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   He's like, "Everybody that sinned in your life, no matter how painful it felt, and it was real, and it was painful.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   It pales in comparison to the infinite debt that you and I have, and have created against God."
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And God, through Jesus on the cross, said, "I'm covering all of it.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   It is paid for.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   It is finished.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And so for me to hold on to a grudge, or hold on to bitterness in my heart towards someone else, makes me like the servant."
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And Jesus says, "My people forgive because they've been forgiven.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   The forgiven forgive people."
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   The second reason why you and I are called, or why we forgive, is because of God's forgiveness in us.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And I'm going to unpack why that is so hard for us to understand, but why it's true.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   But first I want to explain really quick what forgiveness is, because this is where people get lost.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   They think, "Man, forgiving is forgetting.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Forgiving is pretending it didn't happen.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Forgiving is dismissing."
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And so let me cover first what forgiveness is.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Based on the story, it's a perfect example.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Because Jesus says, "Here's what forgiveness is.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   It is releasing the demand for payback."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   It is releasing not the feelings, not the fact that it happened.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It is declaring, "Oh, it's real and it happened.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   But I'm releasing my demand for payback to God.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I am trusting that God and His Word, which tells me that every sin and action and abuse and hurt, harm,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   will either be paid for by that person for all of eternity in hell,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   or was paid for by Jesus on the cross.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   And I'm releasing the demand for payback to God."
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   So forgiveness is releasing the debt, the demand for payback.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And next week, we're going to walk through really, really practically how do you do that.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   But first, I just want to establish, that's what forgiveness is.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Forgiveness is not excusing sin.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Forgiveness or sin is such a big deal that Jesus bled out on a cross for it.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   In other words, it's not pretending, "Oh, it just wasn't a big deal. Don't worry about it."
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It is a huge deal. Sin is such a big deal, Jesus died.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   So it's not pretending that it's not a big deal.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Forgiveness is not forgetting. In fact, it requires remembering.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Because in order for me to say, "You did this, it created a debt.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You took from me.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You took away years. I'm never going to get back.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   You took away my virginity, and then you cheated on me.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   You took away having a mom in the house.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And I'm not pretending it didn't happen.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   But I'm releasing the demand for payback to God.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   It's not forgetting. In fact, it requires remembering.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Because it's saying, "It happened."
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And I'm releasing and trusting God with that.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Forgiveness is also not denying your hurt or your anger.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   You should be hurt. You should be angry.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Sin makes God angry to see his children hurt.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Forgiveness is also not conditional.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   In other words, it doesn't require the other person asking for it.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Or to own their part, or even be present.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   In other words, the idea, and this is a really common belief,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   is like, "Man, I will forgive them as soon as they ask for it."
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   That's not a biblical idea.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   There's people in your life, they're never going to ask for it.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   There's people you don't even know that you're offended by,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   that cut you off at the airport yesterday, and you're like, "Unbelievable. How dare you?"
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And they're gone, and it still messed up the rest of your day,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   and put you in a bad mood.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And so it doesn't require the other person being involved.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   It requires you deciding, "I am releasing the demand for justice to God.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I'm going to trust him with that."
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   But this is Jesus' point. He's trying to make the motivation,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   the reason we forgive is because of the forgiveness God has given to us.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   That there's a far greater debt that we had that he canceled.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   He paid for.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And now, out of an overflow of that, we forgive others.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Paul would pick up this idea, and the New Testament picks it up,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   that we forgive following the example of Jesus towards us.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   This is what Ephesians 4, verse 32 says.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Colossians 3, verse 13 is even more savage. Here's what it says.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   "Make allowances" -- this is so frustrating and relevant.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   "Make allowances for each other's faults."
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   There's going to be people in your life, they're going to hurt you,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   they're going to offend you, going to frustrate you, going to let you down.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   "Make allowances for their faults," Paul said.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   "Forgiving anyone who offends you."
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   This culture is sick, and a number of things that are offensive to people.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And Paul says, "You are to be quick to forgive anyone who offends you."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Am I saying that being offended is invalid? No.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   I'm saying we live in a world that, especially coming out of the recent season,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   everyone is offended by everything, and as Christians, we've got to be able to say,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   "Hey, even when I'm offended, I'm choosing to forgive you."
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   "Forgiving anyone who offends you."
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   In other words, the motivation for forgiving someone
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   doesn't come from looking back at the past and how dare you,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   it comes from looking up at the God who forgave you and forgave me.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Now, the question is always,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   "How is our actions created an infinitely greater debt than what happened to me?"
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   This is a real, real trauma that has happened in the lives of people in this room.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And you're telling me that me looking at pornography,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   or me sleeping with my girlfriend, or me getting drunk a little bit too much
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   is a greater sin against God than some of the worst events
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   that I could have imagined happened to me at such a young age?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   How can that be true?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   The Bible tells us God is holy, perfect.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   A sin against Him is a sin against someone
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   who is of the highest and greatest authority and honor.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And even in our own society, we recognize that a sin against someone,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   the consequence for that sin or action,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   is directly related to the person sinned against.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   You come down front and you lie to me about where you went to school,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   and you're like, "Yeah, you know, I went to Harvard."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And you really went to like, you know, some technical--
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm going to insult somebody, but whatever I say there.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   You really went wherever you went.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And I find out, I'm like, "That's just weird.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Why would you--I mean, why would you lie to me?"
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   You look in the eyes of a federal judge and you lie to him?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   That's called perjury with a five-year prison sentence.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   We understand that the sin against someone,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   the consequence for that is directly related to the person sinned against.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   If you come after the reports tonight, you go to my house in my front yard,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   you trespass on my front yard, I'm going to just be, again, perplexed.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   First, you lie to me about the Harvard thing, and now we're doing the yard thing.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   And maybe frustrated, but if you trespass on the White House front lawn,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   you are going to have a sniper coming after you and face prison time
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   because we recognize the level of authority in the person being offended
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   as a direct correlation to the consequence there,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   and the same with the infinite, holy, perfect God,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   who every person in sinning doesn't just sin against another person.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   They sin against God, the Scripture tells us.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And God was so madly in love with you, despite the fact of all the enormous debt that you paid.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   He didn't just cancel the debt by waving a wand like the king in the story.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   He said, "I will cancel the debt by giving my own life for you on the cross
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   so that every enormous debt that you have would be paid for and canceled."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And now, as a follower of Jesus, we extend forgiveness to a world
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   because we've been forgiven from our God.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And the second reason, and the reason why you and I can forgive,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   is because of the forgiveness that we have received in Christ and have been given to Him.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Finally, he goes into, really, I think one of the more important reasons
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   why we have got to forgive, where it's going to shape the future of your life.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   In the story, we're told that the king comes and he grabs a man and he says,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   "You know what? If you're not going to forgive that debt, you're going to go and be imprisoned."
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And when you read the story, you're like, "What is the analogy? What is he trying to say?"
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   But when you think about it, it's a pretty perfect analogy.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   You know what holding bitterness inside of your heart begins to do?
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   When you're angry and you hold frustration, and it's real frustration and real hurt that happened.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   When you begin to hold that in your heart, it begins to put a prison on you.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   It begins to impact the fact that you can't forgive yourself.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And so the reason why you think that you're damaged goods
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and you could never end up dating somebody like that
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   is because you look at your decisions and your history,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   and when it comes to forgiveness, you haven't even forgiven.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   You can't forgive you.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And then someone comes along in life, and you dated this guy or you dated this girl,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and the way she treated you was wrong, and you got hurt.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   And in response to that hurt, you just begin to put up walls.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And all of a sudden now, "Man, I just don't trust men. I don't trust girls."
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And you've created all these different walls, and that bitterness that got lodged,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   it's impacting your ability to have healthy relationships.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Maybe it was a friend that came up, and they betrayed you.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Maybe it was a bad friend, and they really hurt you.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   And now you just kind of wall it off, and you're like, "Man, I'm not getting hurt like that anymore."
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And you holding on to that bitterness is holding you back from having real relationships and friendships.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Like somebody came along in your life, and there's just a million different things.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And if you want to experience healing, you've got to go, and you've got to decide,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   "I am going to forgive this."
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And you've got to walk through exactly how to do that.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   But you were made fun of when you were in middle school.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And that created an insecurity in you where you never felt enough,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   and you began to turn to pornography.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And maybe you're a girl, and you've never told anybody because you just think,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   "Man, girls don't struggle with that, or I can't be open," which is not true.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   But you can trace it all the way back to somebody made some comment about you
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and the way that you look, and you felt inadequate ever since.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I mean, there's a thousand of them.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Parents, your dad was always working, or your dad was never even there, or he hurts you,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   or you grew up and you were embarrassed about your home.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And somebody down the street, they made fun of the house that you lived in.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And you know what happened?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Something shifted, and you went, "I'm never going to be that again.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   I'm going to work, and now you work, and you work, and you're building your business,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and you're climbing that ladder, and you're doing it because some little
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   eight-year-old snot-nosed kid down the street made fun of your house?"
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And I'm not trying to invalidate any of that.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I'm just saying, how long are you going to live in the shadows of that hurt
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   and allow that to fuel who you're going to be, who you're going to become?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   And God is saying, "You have been invited to forgive and release that debt,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   and you can trust me with that."
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   The third reason why we forgive is because holding on will hold you back.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   This man is thrown in prison, which is such a perfect picture.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Like, hey, if you're not going to forgive, you're going to live in a prison of your own making,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   and it's going to shape your life.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And it's not hurting the person that hurt you.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   It's hurting you.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   It's been well said that bitterness is drinking poison
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   and hoping it hurts the person who hurt you,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   that it's a toxin that's invading,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and there's so many different ways that it is shaping who you are.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Somebody -- I mean, just trace -- there's so many analogies,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   there's so many examples of this.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And I'm not trying to be insensitive, and I'm not trying to invalidate it,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and I've had to go through and still am working through
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   and I have to work through my own hurt.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   And God says, "If you want to experience healing, it's going to involve forgiving."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   A friend of mine hunts -- or lived on a farm growing up,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   and he was out in the country, and they would have these raccoons that would come in,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and they'd just eat crops that they would have.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And so they figured out a way to trap raccoons,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   and the way they would do it is they'd hollow out a log,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and then they'd drill a hole in that log.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   And they would place a shiny object inside of the log,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   and a raccoon would come up, and they would reach their hand in that hole,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   seeing the shiny object, and they would grab it.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Only problem was the hole was only big enough to get the hand through, not to get it out.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And the next day, my friend would show up,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and the raccoon is still holding onto that, and he can't let it go.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   He can't get out.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   If he was just willing to let it go, he'd be free.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   But he doesn't understand that.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And so holding onto it is what's holding him back.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And the same is true with hurt and bitterness,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and the things that you've walked through, and they were real.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And God is inviting you, and our hope in this series is don't suppress it.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Begin to address it, and maybe the biggest, most courageous thing you can decide tonight
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   is I don't know how to do that, which we'll cover next week.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   God, I don't even want to do that.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And maybe you decide, I'm just going to pray, God,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   will you give me the desire to give them what they don't deserve, which is forgiveness?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Because you gave it to me.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Will you give me the desire, God?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Because I don't have that. I don't want that.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   But I don't want holding onto this to hold me back.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Another reason demanding payback is impossible is it's impossible.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Here's what I mean.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   How does someone pay you back for being an alcoholic father
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   who hurts your mom in front of you and your siblings?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   How do you pay that back?
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   How does someone pay you back for the fact that when you were eight,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   you went down and you slept over at a friend's house, and his cousin was there,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   and in the middle of the night, he came in and you were abused, and it was wrong,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   and it began to impact and shape your life?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   How does someone pay that back?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   How does someone pay back the fact that you guys slept together
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and you got pregnant or she got pregnant, and one of you decided,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   man, I think we should get an abortion, and you just felt all kinds of pressure.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And now every year around what would have been the birthday, you think about that,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and you've thought about it for six years, and you carry shame.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   How does someone pay you back for that?
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   God is saying, "They can't, but you can release that to me
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   and know that every sin will either be paid for for all of eternity
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   or it will be paid for on the cross."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   And it wasn't right, and God's heart breaks more than any person
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   and any parent in this room breaks.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   But what I want for you more than anything is you to experience freedom.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And why we forgive is because it's commanded.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   It's because God has forgiven us of a far greater debt
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   and because holding on to that is only going to hold us back.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Like, throughout life, we go through life,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   and so much of our soul gets impacted, and somebody offends us,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and we decide, man, I'm going to hold on to that,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   and I cannot believe that they would say that.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And my best friend in high school all of a sudden betrayed me,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   and I just begin to hold that, and I'm beginning to carry that weight,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   and then life continues to go on, and something else happens.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I decide, you know what? I'm not dealing with this anymore.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   My dad wasn't around. I'm not going to do that.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And you begin to carry weights.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   No one can see them on the outside, but they're weighing your life down,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   and they're going to impact the future of who you are and who you're going to be.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And then you go through more, and you get into college,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   and there's all kinds of things that showed up at college,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   where all of a sudden that girl you were dating and the friend that you had,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and piece by piece you begin to pile on and carry and carry.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And you know what?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Scripture teaches it's too heavy for you to carry, and you weren't meant to.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   And God has gone to great lengths to give you freedom.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   In our world, there's so little training in talking about what it looks like to forgive.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   If anything, we encourage it, and we validate it.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And what my heart for you in this series is that maybe you just begin to go,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   "God, I'm not going to live like everybody else, and I want to be free.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And I don't want to carry this into the next relationship.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   I don't want to just shape the future that I'm going to have.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I don't want to shape the parenting that I'm going to be.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I don't want to shape the life and the woman and the man that I'm going to be."
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And the most courageous thing maybe you can do, because maybe you're not tonight ready to say,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   "Man, I am choosing to forgive.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   They took that from me, and they don't owe me anymore."
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Is to say, "God, I want to want to forgive.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Will you help me?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Will you, by your Spirit, will you help me?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   God, I want to want to forgive, but if I'm honest, the pain is so real.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   I don't know that I can, and it won't be easy, and it won't be a moment.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   If anything, it's going to be a process, but freedom is possible.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   You can just keep carrying it, and no one will see it on the outside.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   But just like something left over from the past isn't going away, it's not going away.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Let me pray.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Father, I pray for friends in the room who have been so hurt by people in authority
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   who are supposed to provide and protect them,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   had events happen to them that they wouldn't have chose,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and it has shaped so much of their life.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   And it wasn't fair, and it wasn't right.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   I pray that you would stir their heart, that maybe they would just say,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   "God, I don't know that I can, but I want to be able to forgive.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   I want to have the desire to want to forgive.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   And so will you help me?"
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And I pray that your Spirit would work in a mighty, powerful way.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Would you set free, which is what you say you do.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   You say, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And so there's places in all of our hearts of people who have offended us
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and hurt us big and small in ways that have impacted us.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Would you allow your Spirit to bring freedom and healing to some of the darkest crevices,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   to some of the things that we never told anybody about?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And I pray for anyone who is at that place of going,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   "Because of what you did for me, Jesus, and you paid for my debt,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   I am choosing not to hold what they did, their sin, against them."
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   It was paid for, that you would give them the strength to release that.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And when those thoughts and feelings pop up again,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   you would give them the strength to release that and to entrust that with you.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   It's far too heavy a thing for us to carry.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   We worship you now in song.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And we may groom and invite you into our hearts and into our lives.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Would you have your way, God?
