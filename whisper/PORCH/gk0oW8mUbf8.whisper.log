[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   [dramatic music]
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:28.660]   Let's go, welcome everybody in the room.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.520]   [audience cheering]

[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.060]   Welcome in all the other locations.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.280]   Everybody tuning in just online.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.240]   We are continuing the series, "Scandals,"
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.900]   looking at some of the sinners
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.200]   that were a part of the family tree
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.600]   that led to Jesus being on the planet.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.560]   And let me start with a story
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.320]   that'll give us some traction.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.540]   I, for most of my life,
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.980]   had no idea who my great-grandparents were.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.700]   And I don't mean I never met them.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.400]   I mean, I didn't know who they were.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.220]   And why?
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.660]   Because my grandfather was adopted.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.000]   And he was adopted in like stork fashion.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700]   Basically, 100 years ago,
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.840]   if you got pregnant and you weren't gonna have the baby,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.400]   you would just leave it on the doorstep
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.920]   of someone in town or a doctor.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.400]   And this was small town Kansas.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.360]   And that's how my grandfather basically got adopted,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   is he was dropped off on a doctor's doorstep.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.840]   So for most of his life,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.840]   and for most of my life and just our family's life,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.120]   we had no idea who were we really related to.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.880]   Until my uncle Randy,
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.600]   and Uncle Randy is probably the person,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.720]   I feel like this person's kind of in everyone's family.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.760]   He's like the most like Kramer from Seinfeld person
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.280]   I've ever met in my life.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.880]   He's an artist for a living
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.120]   and makes most of his art with recyclables.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.380]   So basically, my aunt is his sugar mama.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.960]   And Uncle Randy was like,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.760]   "I'm gonna track down and figure out who this person is."
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.860]   And he doesn't use ancestry.com.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.240]   He's out there, man.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.360]   So you go into his house
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.920]   and he's got like a spider web of pictures on the wall
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.040]   with different connections where he was gonna track down
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.960]   and figure out who dropped off
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.520]   and who were the actual biological parents of my grandfather.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.280]   And he tracked people down and he,
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.320]   you can throw that up there.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.000]   He tracked people down.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.820]   He did interviews, he called people,
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.520]   he put eBay alerts for any postage stamp
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.160]   that was out there that used their zip code.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.320]   I mean, Randy clearly had way too much time on his hand.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.600]   But he eventually found it and he found a picture
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.680]   and he found out who our biological great-grandparents were.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.000]   And this is Rex and Faye.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.280]   And he tracked down that basically
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.000]   this was a high school pregnancy in small town Kansas
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.640]   in the early 19 teens, think like World War I.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.460]   And what happened when someone would get pregnant
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.160]   at that time, either they would immediately get married
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   or they would give the child up for adoption
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.020]   and basically kind of well-to-do family
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.100]   or like the local town mayor decided who was his father,
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.620]   or Rex's father, said,
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.520]   "We're gonna give this child up for adoption."
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.860]   And so my grandfather went through his entire life
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.400]   not knowing who he was related to
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.460]   because even still to this day,
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.820]   that side of the family, they ended up not getting married
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.420]   and married other people.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.920]   They never connected with their son.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   And what is that a reflection of?
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360]   It's just kind of human nature that generally speaking,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.740]   we're not quick to move to the forefront
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.420]   of their scandals in the family tree
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.540]   unless you're Matthew writing about Jesus.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.580]   In other words, when we look through the lineage of Jesus,
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.320]   unlike today where people would have a scandal
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.440]   or young teen pregnancy and they'd kind of cover it up
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.900]   and you don't really hear much about that,
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.780]   Matthew sets out and begins to write the lineage of Jesus,
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.020]   the savior of the world.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.220]   And the people that he talks about,
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.260]   it's astounding that God included them
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.180]   in the family line of Jesus.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.080]   But it's also astounding that Matthew highlights them
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.660]   in the family line of Jesus.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.120]   And so we're walking week by week
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.660]   and looking at some of the scandals that were involved.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.620]   Last week, JD set us up and we talked through a sex scandal
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.940]   that involves Judah and Tamar,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.180]   basically a father-in-law sleeping with his daughter-in-law.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.620]   Yeah, that's in the Bible.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.260]   We'll make "Game of Thrones" blush.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.760]   And this week, we're gonna look at another person
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.100]   that has a story, that has a past, that had a profession
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.980]   that was among the lowest of low in her society.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.740]   And so I'm gonna read through in Matthew chapter one,
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.100]   which is where the lineage of Jesus,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.980]   it's the part that generally people skip over
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.700]   when they go right into the gospels.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.540]   We're gonna look at another name and then read her story.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.260]   Because this woman would be the great, great, great,
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.220]   great, great, great, great, great grandmother of Jesus.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.860]   She was in the bloodline.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.940]   So I'm gonna be in Matthew chapter one,
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.940]   I'm gonna read these verses and then go
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.180]   and move over to this woman's story.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.220]   Because last week, we talked about how our past
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.220]   is not a problem for God.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.820]   But this woman had a present.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.540]   And we see how God pursued, related to,
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.900]   interacted with this woman in the midst of her sin
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.260]   and circumstances.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.940]   So Matthew chapter one, verse one says,
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.860]   "This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah,
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.840]   "son of David, son of Abraham.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.080]   "Abraham was the father of Isaac,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.700]   "Isaac, the father of Jacob,
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.780]   "Jake, the father of Judah and his brothers,
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.520]   "Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.320]   "whose mother was Tamar."
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   So you can check that out, message we did last week.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.060]   "Perez was the father of Hezron.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.340]   "Hezron was the father of Ram."
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.500]   Probably the greatest guy, that is like a nose tackle name,
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.620]   Ram, it's amazing.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.620]   "Ram was the father of Ammonadab."
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.880]   It's not a nose tackle name.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.340]   "Ammonadab was the father of Nashon.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.740]   "Nashon was the father of Salmon."
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.940]   It's not salmon, people, it's not.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.540]   I know you think it's salmon, it's not.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.440]   Don't do that.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.560]   Somebody over here, you're like, oh, Salmon,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.640]   he thinks Salmon.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.960]   It's trout too and tilapia.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.620]   Nope, it is Salmon,
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.280]   who is the father of Boaz,
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.900]   whose mother was Rahab.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.420]   Now, if you grew up in church,
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.540]   you're familiar with Rahab, or you may be,
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.140]   but Rahab had not just a past, she had a present.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.800]   She carried a label.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.320]   We're gonna look and walk through her story.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.400]   It's in Joshua chapter two.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.240]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.420]   you can flip over to Joshua chapter two
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.660]   and let me set up what's going on.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.420]   So the nation of Israel was in slavery
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.300]   for 400 years in Egypt.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.020]   And God shows up and you probably saw the movie,
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.100]   "The Prince of Egypt," greatest song track of all time.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.660]   And God goes to Pharaoh, says, "Let my people go."
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.300]   Eventually, after 10 plagues, he lets them go.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.060]   They wander around with Moses leading them
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.860]   in the desert for 40 years, and Moses passes away.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.620]   And God says, "Joshua is gonna take over."
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.980]   This would have been like George Washington passing away
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.940]   and John Adams or whoever came after next takes over,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.300]   and that's Joshua.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.700]   And God says, "Joshua, you are gonna lead my people
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.760]   "into the promised land, the land that I've said,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.960]   "this is where you are going to live."
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.020]   It's where the nation of Israel is today.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.020]   But in order for that to happen,
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.740]   they had to go in and basically conquer
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.540]   all these evil tribes of people that were there,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.620]   namely a group called the Canaanites.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.580]   And the Canaanites had this one city
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.360]   that was one of the wonders of the ancient world.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.600]   It was a city called Jericho.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.840]   Jericho was known for these enormous walls
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.920]   that were 10 feet wide and 27 feet tall.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.220]   It was a fortified city that people would travel
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.060]   just to come see because it was such a spectacular thing.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.660]   And Joshua is told that you guys are going
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.060]   to take out the city of Jericho.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.780]   And so Joshua decides, "Man, we gotta send out some spies
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.700]   "in order to kind of scout out and see what's happening."
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.140]   And those spies go, and here's where the story picks up.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.900]   So Joshua secretly sent out two spies
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.020]   from the Israel camp at Acacia Grove.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.400]   He instructed them, "Scout out the land
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.540]   "on the other side of the Jordan River,
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.420]   "especially around Jericho."
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.980]   So the two men set out, and they came to the house
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.740]   of a prostitute named Rahab.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.180]   And they stayed there that night.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.500]   But someone told the king of Jericho,
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.180]   "Some Israelites have come here tonight
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.440]   "to spy out the land."
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.000]   So the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.680]   "Bring out the men who've come into your house,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.740]   "for they've come here to spy out the whole land."
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.840]   Now if you read that and you wonder,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.080]   why wouldn't the king just have somebody
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.480]   bust down the door and go in there?
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.880]   Well, Rahab is a prostitute.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.800]   And one thing you never know about prostitutes
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.880]   is who else is in that room that you may be busting in.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.640]   So they don't bust in, they knock on the door,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.840]   say, "Hey, we think that there's two spies that are in here."
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.080]   And Rahab says,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.800]   "Yes, the men were here earlier," verse four,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.320]   "but I didn't know where they were from.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.660]   "They left town at dusk as the gates were about to close.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.600]   "I don't know where they went.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.240]   "If you hurry, you can probably catch up with them.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.080]   "Actually, she had taken them up to the roof
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.800]   "and hidden them beneath bundles of flax,"
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.560]   basically these cloth or fabrics that had been laid out.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.160]   "So the king's men went looking for the spies
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.240]   "along the road leading to the shallow crossings
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.080]   "of the Jordan River.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.840]   "As soon as the king's men had left the gate,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.920]   "the gate of Jericho was shut."
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.260]   So she, basically she lies to the king and says,
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.480]   "Yeah, they were here,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.800]   "but they went somewhere that direction.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.400]   "If you really hurry, I bet you can go catch 'em."
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.880]   And then she goes back up to where she had hidden them
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.600]   on the roof and covered them with fabric.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.660]   She says this,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:48.000]   "I know that the Lord," verse eight,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.700]   "has given you this land.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.820]   "We are all afraid of you.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.680]   "Everyone in Jericho is living in terror.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   "For we have heard how the Lord made a dry path for you
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   "through the Red Sea when you left Egypt.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.020]   "And we know what you did to Sihon and Og,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.940]   "the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River."
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.260]   She references a battle or battles
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.400]   that had just happened earlier.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.460]   "Whose people you left completely destroyed.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.100]   "No wonder our hearts have melted in fear.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:26.800]   "No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.080]   "For the Lord, your God,
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.080]   "is the supreme God of heavens above and earth below."
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.480]   How did she know all of this?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.240]   Well, if you're a prostitute
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.360]   and you have men constantly coming through your brothel,
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.120]   there's gonna come times where just in the midst
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.480]   of after servicing men, selling your body for sex,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.920]   you make casual conversations.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.240]   She probably knew as much information
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.000]   as anybody that wasn't in the army.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.640]   And she had heard about what God had done
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.700]   and she's asking these soldiers, like, "Were you there?
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.440]   "God parted the Red Sea?
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.160]   "Were you there?
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.760]   "Did it really happen that you came in
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.200]   "and you guys just destroyed these other kingdoms?"
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.140]   And the men are saying, "It's true."
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.460]   And she says, "Everyone here is in terror of you."
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.280]   And she believed and expresses her faith that your God,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.800]   and this time everybody had different gods.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   Canaanites had their own gods.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.120]   And she says, "Your God is the one true God."
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.680]   And then she asked them for a favor.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.040]   "Swear to me by the Lord,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.940]   "you will be kind to me and my family
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.240]   "since I have helped you.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.140]   "Give me some guarantee that when Jericho is conquered,
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.480]   "you will let me live along with my father and my mother
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.280]   "and brothers and sisters and their families.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.920]   "We offer our own lives as a guarantee for your safety."
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.280]   The men agreed.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.080]   "If you don't betray us, we will keep our promise
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.160]   "and be kind to you when the Lord gives us the land."
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.960]   So she agrees, she basically sends them on their way
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.120]   and puts down a rope for them to go escape.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.800]   And it says, verse 17, "Before they left,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.240]   "the men told her, 'We bound ourselves
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.740]   "'to the oath we have taken.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.740]   "'Only if you follow these instructions.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.740]   "'When we come into the land, into Jericho,
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.720]   "'we must leave the scar, or you must leave
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.100]   "'the scarlet rope, this red rope,
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:24.740]   "'hanging from the window through which you let us down.
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.160]   "'All of your family members, your father, mother,
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.300]   "'brothers, and all of your relatives
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.900]   "'must be inside the house.'"
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.740]   They're outside of the house,
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.100]   basically we can't guarantee their protection,
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.140]   but put this red rope in the window
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.940]   so we will know this house uniquely will be protected
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.740]   and everybody that's inside of it.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.060]   She agreed to their terms, the men went off,
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.800]   they went back to Joshua and they said,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.860]   "Everyone in the city is terrified
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.400]   "because God, they know, has given us the land."
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.260]   Oh, it's an amazing story,
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.620]   it's kind of a fascinating and bizarre story.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.620]   Why would that be so important and relevant
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.260]   that Matthew would say, "I have to include Rahab
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.360]   "in the lineage of Jesus, I'm gonna highlight her
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.020]   "in the lineage of Jesus."
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.860]   Well, I think there's several things
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.980]   that we learn about God in Rahab's story.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.060]   In fact, we learn about God and we learn about our story
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.500]   'cause there's parallels to ways in which Rahab's story
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.460]   is you and I's story.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.420]   And I wanna walk through three observations
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.440]   as it relates to this story.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   The first one is that God runs after people with labels.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:36.040]   God runs after people with labels, with reputations.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.360]   Like Rahab had a label,
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.520]   a label that followed her all throughout the Bible.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.360]   Almost every single time that she's mentioned except one,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.800]   it says, "Rahab the prostitute."
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.860]   "Rahab the prostitute."
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.080]   Rahab had a label that carried around
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.960]   and it was reflective of her profession, of her sin.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   She had, in the midst of a culture,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.200]   the Canaanite culture, can only makes ISIS look tame.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.560]   I mean, this child sacrificed the evil and atrocities
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.280]   and inside of that culture, she had chosen the profession
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.420]   for whatever reason of being a prostitute.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.640]   I don't know why and it doesn't tell us why.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.420]   My guess is she didn't grow up as a little girl
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.980]   dreaming of being a prostitute.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.720]   But she had to find a way to make ends meet
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.800]   and to pay for things.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.880]   And so she began selling her body for sex.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.680]   And that label was attached to her, Rahab the prostitute.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.780]   And God sends two men into that city.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.000]   They didn't know they were gonna bump into her,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   but God did because God seeks after people with labels.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.520]   The reason this is so important is in some ways,
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.740]   all of us have a label.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.480]   You came in and you may not think about it that way,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.760]   but there's ways in which there's sin in your life
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.160]   that reflects a label.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.840]   Maybe of a past decision you made,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.800]   something you've never told anybody about.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.300]   And if you were honest, you feel like, man,
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.280]   there's just some labels that I carry around
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   that are attached to me.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.520]   Decisions that I made in college,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.320]   dating relationships I used to have,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.900]   addictions that I can't break.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:13.620]   And Rahab's story showcases the true God who is there,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.700]   chases after and pursues people with labels.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.060]   My girl on my team has this machine,
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.560]   it's called a label maker.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.680]   It's actually pretty amazing.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.500]   I personally have never used one before,
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.020]   but organized people, this is your thing.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.220]   And you can create labels that allow you to put on
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.660]   whatever papers or documents or anything you want,
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.100]   different labels.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.060]   And there's labels that I think if we were honest,
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.880]   some of us carry around and it feels like they define us.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.140]   And Rahab's story shows us there's a God
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.900]   who seeks, pursues, and replaces labels.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.740]   What do I mean by labels?
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.100]   I mean things like, I'm Alex the bulimic.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:16:00.820]   And nobody knows, but it's a label you carry,
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.100]   and you have carried, and you kind of think
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.000]   you're gonna carry it your whole life.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.260]   Maybe it's a label like Andrew the unwanted.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.060]   Just relationship after relationship,
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.700]   if it's taught me anything, it's that I am not wanted.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.000]   Damaged goods, no one wants to be with me.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.020]   And there's a label that you've embraced or that's attached.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.460]   Maybe it's Sam the alcoholic.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.020]   And it went from man, I was just partying,
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.540]   and I was a fraternity brother,
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.160]   and now I can't go more than a couple days.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.880]   I'm drinking all the time just to numb some of the pain.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.020]   Maybe it's Susie the one night stand.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.980]   You would never say it like that,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.400]   but somewhere in your heart, you think,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.580]   nobody wants a relationship with me.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.780]   Closest I can get is giving my body away.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.780]   It's a label.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:08.820]   Maybe it's Kristen the abused.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.100]   Something happened and it wasn't your fault,
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.420]   and you still carry pain and scars.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.740]   Maybe you even believe lies,
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.280]   and that label you feel like is so attached.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.360]   Maybe it's the label of, man, I'm just depressed.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.820]   I can't get out of this season.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.020]   I don't know if I'll ever get out of it.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.780]   Maybe it's a porn addiction that,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.620]   man, I just need to get married
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.100]   because I'll never be able to conquer this.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.760]   And you have bought into this idea of labels.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.500]   And Rahab's story, as we enter into it,
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.940]   I wanna showcase is that God pursues people with labels.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.340]   He could have chose anybody to be
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.580]   the great, great, great grandmother of Jesus.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.300]   And he chooses a woman with as clear of a label
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.180]   as anybody in the Bible.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.020]   Now it begs the question,
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.620]   why would Matthew go out of his way to highlight this?
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:08.140]   Well, if you remember, Matthew had a label.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.980]   You remember it?
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.940]   Matthew the tax collector.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.460]   Matthew was an outcast of society.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.100]   Matthew's the one right in the lineage of Jesus.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.020]   And he was, by an outcast, I mean,
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.700]   tax collectors were seen as people
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.540]   who God had totally given up on.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.060]   They were not welcome to go to church.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.580]   They were not welcome to meet with a rabbi.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.220]   They weren't welcome in society.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.780]   They betrayed their own people
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.460]   in order to tax them and make money off of them.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.260]   They were seen as people who clearly didn't believe in God
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.340]   'cause of the lifestyle they lived.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.340]   And Matthew lived, and he was Matthew the tax collector,
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.240]   until one day he meets Jesus.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.660]   And Jesus walks up to him,
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.940]   and he'd never talked to a rabbi before.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.300]   Rabbis didn't talk to tax collectors, but this one did.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.860]   And he walks up in Matthew chapter nine,
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.620]   and we're told he walks up to the booth
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.140]   or to the desk that Matthew is taxing his fellow country,
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.900]   fellow countrymen.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.100]   And he says, "Matthew, come follow me.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.820]   "I want you to be my disciple."
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.420]   Matthew had never had anybody want him to be around.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.540]   And so we're told that he gets up in Matthew chapter nine.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.380]   They went on from there.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.200]   He saw a man named Matthew.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.040]   He said, "Follow me."
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.900]   And Matthew got up, and he followed him.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.300]   It makes all the sense in the world
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.400]   that Matthew, as he's writing the story,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.260]   includes this woman who had a label
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.940]   because Matthew had a label.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:32.480]   And she wasn't just the part of the story.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.740]   She was the point of the story
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.640]   that he was about to write for the next 27 chapters
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.860]   in the book of Matthew,
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.440]   that our God seeks and runs after people who have labels,
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.780]   who have pasts, who have present sin that mark them.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:54.900]   My friend, his name is Shane,
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.860]   and eight years ago, when we were looking to buy a house,
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.100]   he was telling us just basically his advice.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.460]   I'm about to tell it to you right now.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.940]   My wife and I were looking to buy a house,
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.620]   and he was like, "Bro, here's what you need to do, okay?
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.940]   "If you're balling on a budget, I'm gonna help you out.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.820]   "You wanna find the house that nobody wants."
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.980]   He said, "I only buy foreclosures.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.060]   "I go to the bank, I find the foreclosures,
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.780]   "and the house that you want is the house
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.520]   "that makes everybody else be like, nope, her past.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.140]   "The house that has foundation problems.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.800]   "The house, if it's got mold, how much mold?
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.860]   "You want the mold.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.940]   "You want a house that's so dysfunctional,
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.380]   "it scares everybody away so that you can get it
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.020]   "for a price that's like, oh, 75 cents, sold.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.940]   "That's the house that you're looking for.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.880]   "The house that everyone else says, oh, no, no way,
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.840]   "there's dead people or they died in here.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.780]   "That's what you're looking for, bro."
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.620]   And I was thinking about that this week,
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.660]   and in some ways, that's a reflection
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.500]   of the God in the Bible.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.260]   He's looking for the people that society, that the world,
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.340]   that if you feel like you're too far gone
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.740]   and too broken and too messed up,
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.380]   that makes you the perfect candidate for the grace of God.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.260]   The great-great-grandmother of Jesus
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.060]   is selling her body for sex.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.260]   And God says, she's in the family line.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:18.020]   That's exactly the type of person he's looking for.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.060]   In fact, it makes you a better candidate
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.780]   'cause a lot of people think the labels they carry
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.180]   is I'm Barry the Bible reader, I'm Barry the good guy,
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.180]   or I'm the type of person that God
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.300]   does want a relationship with
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.060]   'cause I've done everything right.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.820]   And the mindset of a person
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.660]   that will be able to have a relationship with God,
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.940]   somebody that understands, I carry labels
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.940]   whether I want to or realize it,
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.420]   but God seeks after those who are labeled or have labels.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.820]   And not just that, he does something else.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.760]   Verse 20.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.860]   So after the city falls, in other words,
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.100]   they go back to Joshua and God says,
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.940]   "Hey, here's the plan.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.180]   "You're gonna walk around the city."
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.380]   It's a really unconventional plan
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.460]   we don't have time to go into fully,
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.700]   but it says, "For seven days,
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.800]   "you're gonna get the marching band.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.900]   "You guys are gonna walk around
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.460]   "the city of Jericho seven times.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.780]   "And then on the seventh day,
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.020]   "you're gonna walk around it seven times.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.180]   "And at the seventh time, you're gonna yell,
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.600]   "play the trumpets, get the trombone going,
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.620]   "and the walls are gonna fall."
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.860]   And it happens.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.380]   Verse 20.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.200]   When the people heard the sound of the rams and the horns,
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.360]   they shouted as loud as they could.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.420]   Suddenly, the walls of Jericho collapsed.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.740]   And we're told by archeology,
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.480]   the walls actually fell outward.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.320]   Why is that significant?
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.820]   Because walls, if something imploded, it would fall inward.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.180]   They fell outward.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.620]   As though it was an act of God,
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.740]   creating ramps for the Israelite army to run up into.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.900]   Israelites charged into town and captured it.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.940]   They completely destroyed everything in it
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.820]   with their swords, men and women, young and old,
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.260]   cattle and sheep, goats and donkeys.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.020]   And Joshua said to the spies,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.560]   "Keep your promise.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.440]   "Go to the prostitute's house
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.620]   "and bring her out along with all of her family."
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.060]   The men who had been spies went in
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.180]   and they brought out Rahab, her mother, father,
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.780]   all of her family.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.420]   And they moved her whole family to a safe place
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.540]   near the camp of Israel.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.180]   So all the walls just fell down except one house.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.540]   This one part of this huge wall,
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.140]   'cause remember, Rahab lived in the wall,
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.260]   and there's one house with a window
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.380]   that has a red rope, scarlet rope, hanging in it.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.360]   And Rahab, in the midst of all the chaos,
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.380]   somebody comes, knocks on the door and says,
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.580]   "We're moving you into the family of God."
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.120]   The second idea we see from the text
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.980]   is that God rescues people with labels.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.840]   He rescues people with labels.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.480]   Rahab was rescued and saved by grace,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.860]   not 'cause she deserved it,
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.280]   but because of the undeserved favor of God on her life.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.840]   In other words, if God was gonna destroy Dallas,
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.320]   like you heard, hey, he's gonna take out Dallas.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.700]   He's gonna save one person.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.660]   Who do you think he would save?
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.080]   Like we'd probably go through our list and be like,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.920]   man, he probably, you know,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.540]   there's probably a really nice grandma somewhere
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.640]   he's gonna save, or like, you know,
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.260]   a really high priest or pastor out there,
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.320]   or somebody high in philanthropy
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.820]   that has given a lot of money.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.260]   Would you choose a prostitute?
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.460]   'Cause that's who God chose.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.580]   And he rescues Rahab by grace,
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.300]   the same way that he still rescues people today,
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.460]   'cause God rescues people with labels.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.380]   And then he moves them to the family of God
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.700]   and he changes their labels.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.620]   But she was saved by grace.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.300]   Grace is a word Christians throw out.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.980]   It's just a word that means undeserved favor.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.060]   Mercy is not getting the punishment you deserve.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.660]   Grace is not getting the punishment you deserve
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.040]   and getting something better that you don't deserve.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.660]   I've said it before, my son, Crew, when he was four,
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.660]   I took him to his room.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.300]   He basically had hit his sister and was like,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.140]   you're getting a spanking.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.660]   We sat down and I decided,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.380]   I'm gonna make this an object lesson for grace.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.740]   I'm gonna teach you son right now, father of the year.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.960]   So I walk him through and explain,
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.940]   you know what, I'm gonna give you grace.
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.140]   Do you know what that means?
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.620]   It means I'm gonna hit myself
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.340]   and I hit myself as hard as I could or hard,
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.040]   and I'm gonna give you candy.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.100]   That's grace.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.580]   You don't get the punishment you deserve
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.500]   and you get something amazing you don't deserve.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.380]   Which kind of backfired because ever since that moment,
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.180]   every time he gets in trouble, he's like,
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.380]   please, please, I want grace.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.200]   I want grace.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.040]   I want grace this time to mommy.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:18.880]   Hit mommy.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.960]   I'm like, whoa, okay.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.480]   Not exactly how grace works.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.820]   But it reflects that, hey,
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.060]   that is what Christians believe.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.260]   They have never believed.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.300]   And you may have been taught this,
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.140]   or you may have been raised,
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.360]   and we went to confirmation,
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.500]   or you went and were taught that Christians
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.580]   have a relationship with God because they deserve it,
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.100]   or they earn it, or they maintain it
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.540]   because they do enough good things.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.380]   That is a lie.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.540]   That's not a Bible idea.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.580]   That is a worldly idea.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.940]   The belief of Christians is that
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.180]   only by undeserved favor, aka the grace of God,
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.720]   by grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.900]   And this is not of yourself so that no one can vote.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.840]   The only way anybody gets a relationship
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.580]   is the God who rescues people with labels
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.580]   by grace through faith.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.420]   What's faith?
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.000]   Faith is believing God, trusting in him,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.660]   trusting in our sins and what Jesus did on the cross
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.420]   as payment for your sin.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.840]   That's what Christians believe.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.140]   The way you become a Christian is I believe
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.640]   Jesus paid for my sin on the cross,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.780]   and he rose from the dead as proof for that payment.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.620]   Boom.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.540]   And Rahab, 1,500 years before Jesus would live,
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.980]   expressed I believe your God.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.100]   You guys, they're out wandering in the forest.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.640]   She's sitting in the most walled,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.580]   protected city in the world, and she says,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.080]   "I know your God is the one true God, and I believe.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.420]   "And so I'm gonna hide you because I believe
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.580]   "that your God is gonna do what he has promised to do."
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.960]   And that was a faith that saved her.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.540]   So much so that multiple times,
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.720]   Rahab is pointed to in the New Testament
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.840]   by New Testament writers.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.520]   It's pretty astonishing when you think about it.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.320]   They point to Rahab as much as they do
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.440]   so many other characters in the New Testament,
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.280]   where they pull back.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.160]   In James chapter two, the brother of Jesus,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.000]   he says, "I'm gonna give you two examples of faith."
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.820]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.660]   James, the little brother of Jesus,
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.160]   wrote the book of James, and he pulls out,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.820]   and he's like, "Let's talk about faith.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.840]   "Two people I wanna talk about.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   "Father Abraham had many sons, the father of our faith."
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.400]   In James two, he talks about Abraham.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.340]   And then he says, "I'm gonna give you another example."
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.420]   You would think he would go, I don't know,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.580]   David or Noah or Isaac or Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.580]   There's a lot of people.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.480]   Who does he pull?
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.080]   James chapter two, verse 25.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.120]   "In the same way, was not Rahab the prostitute
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.280]   "considered righteous for what she did
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.300]   "when she gave lodging to the spies
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.180]   "and sent them off in a different direction,
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.600]   "but she believed, and it changed her."
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.880]   And then, I think one of my favorite ones,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.440]   the hall of faith.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.440]   Hebrews chapter 11 is called the hall of faith.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.280]   Why?
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.100]   Because they go through,
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:55.940]   and it's basically like the hall of fame,
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.840]   only for the faith men and women in our nations,
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.680]   or in the family of God's history.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.420]   And they go through, and they name people you'd think.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.500]   They got Moses.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.820]   Yeah, of course, you don't let my people go.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.120]   They got Abraham, the founder of the faith.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.800]   They got Isaac and Jacob, of course.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.340]   And then they bring up Rahab.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.940]   And he says this.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.600]   "By faith, the prostitute Rahab,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.960]   "because she welcomed the spies,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.960]   "was not killed with those who were disobedient."
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.720]   Look at the next sentence.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.240]   He's going through, and he's listed all these people out,
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.680]   and he's like, oh, so Rahab,
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.520]   that incredible faith that Rahab had.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.560]   And then he says, "And what more shall I say?
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.980]   "I do not have time to talk about Gideon,
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.300]   "Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.880]   "and the prophets."
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.520]   You got time to talk about Rahab, the prostitute,
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.020]   who wasn't even Jewish?
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.680]   You ain't got time to talk about David,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.620]   the greatest king in Israel, man after God's own heart,
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.320]   defeated Goliath, one of the heroes.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.720]   Jesus is called the son of David.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.800]   But you got time to talk about Rahab?
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:09.760]   That God pursues and rescues by grace, through faith,
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.160]   by grace, through faith, and Rahab is seen as somebody
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.020]   that God comes in despite her label
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.020]   and uses in mighty ways.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.800]   Finally, we get to, I think,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.540]   what is the best part of the story,
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.340]   and the romantic part of the story, if you will.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.420]   It says this.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.540]   "So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute,
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:39.660]   "and her relatives who were with her in that house,
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.560]   "because she had hidden the spies Joshua sent to Jericho.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.560]   "And she lives among the Israelites to this day."
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.740]   And she lives among the Israelites,
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.080]   the Jewish people, to this day.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.240]   When they wrote the book of Joshua,
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.580]   Rahab was still alive, you could go see her.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.500]   It said, man, there's Rahab, down the street,
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.280]   lives in a different house, no longer a prostitute.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.180]   Why do I say that?
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.540]   Because we're told that eventually,
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.780]   Rahab bumps into somebody named Salmon.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.000]   And Salmon, not salmon, you're gonna meet him someday
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.220]   if you were a Christian in heaven,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.980]   he's gonna be like, well, I ain't a fish, man, I'm a man.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.180]   And Salmon bumps into Rahab, and he's like,
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.700]   ooh, girl, man, you wanna go to lunch?
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.300]   They meet on jewishmingle.com or wherever,
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.500]   and they hit it off, they go to lunch.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.300]   And then he's like, man, I really enjoyed that.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.140]   I'd like to go to lunch.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.580]   They go to dinner, and eventually,
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.020]   first comes love, then comes marriage,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.820]   then comes Boaz and a baby carriage.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.900]   And they have a baby boy.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.300]   And Salmon did what would've been unthinkable.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.220]   He didn't marry prostitutes in that day and age.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.940]   But Salmon was a godly man, and he did what godly men do.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.580]   And this is really important, it's a side note,
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.580]   but it's relevant to the story,
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.700]   and maybe relevant to your story.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.940]   I hear all the time of people saying,
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.660]   you know, I just, I feel like I've got too much baggage,
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.920]   too much junk in my past.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.620]   A godly guy or a godly girl
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.620]   doesn't want anything to do with me.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.720]   A godly guy or a godly girl
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.880]   will see you like God does.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.620]   In other words, if they're a godly guy,
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.340]   they don't go, oh man, hey, this is all the things
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.180]   that's wrong with you.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.180]   That's not a godly person.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.300]   That's a spiritually immature person.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.260]   A godly guy sees like God does.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.420]   A godly girl sees like God does.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.500]   How does God see?
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.660]   In 1 Samuel chapter 16, verse eight, it says,
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.100]   I, the Lord, do not look at outward appearances.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.760]   I look at the heart.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.980]   And so if you are somebody who is walking with Jesus,
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.380]   you're buying a lie if you think that, man,
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.960]   a godly guy would never have interest in someone like me.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.980]   A ungodly guy may hold that against you,
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.720]   but a godly man or godly woman sees like God does.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.260]   And Solomon saw like God does,
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.780]   and he saw this woman who, despite her past
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.500]   and her brokenness, had by faith come to be a part
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.580]   of the family of God.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.260]   And he asked her out, and eventually they get married.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.420]   And she becomes a part of the royal bloodline of God.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.460]   Why do I say that?
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:14.320]   Because we're told that in Matthew chapter one, verse five,
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.020]   Solomon was the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.180]   Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.760]   Obed was the father of Jesse.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.020]   And Jesse was the father of King David.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:36.300]   And she goes from prostitute to princess
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.240]   in the royal family of God.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.040]   In other words, if you have judgment,
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.560]   you think of Rahab, the prostitute,
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.960]   and go, man, that's so jacked up.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.120]   You are talking about Jesus' great, great, great grandmother
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.920]   or King David's great grandmother.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.880]   Like whatever the equivalent in that day and age.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.520]   Like I don't know if back then they did what we do today,
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.880]   where it's like, this is my mema, my papa,
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.200]   and we just make up these weird names.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.880]   It's like, and then my hee-haw, and this is my.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.960]   And whatever that was for David,
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.400]   if you're throwing shade at Rahab, he's like,
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.160]   dude, that's my great mema.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.320]   That's who she was.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.360]   And Jesus, think about this.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.780]   The savior of the world went to the cross
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.860]   with the blood of a prostitute running through his veins.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.100]   Running through his veins.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.860]   To die for broken people.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.500]   Because everyone is broken.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   And the showcase of Rahab and her story
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.660]   is that Jesus didn't just come for sinners.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.500]   He came from sinners, 'cause that's all there is.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.660]   And inside of the story, we see that he's a God
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.980]   who seeks after people with labels.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.580]   He saves people with labels.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.140]   And finally, he rewrites people's labels.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.580]   And just like he took Rahab and took her from,
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.820]   hey, you were Rahab, the prostitute,
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.580]   and now you are Rahab, the princess of the family of God.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.820]   And the royal lineage.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.300]   He could do that the same to you and to me,
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.740]   and take porn addicts like me, and say,
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.860]   I'm gonna take you.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.460]   And by surrendering, which is what she did,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.940]   she decided, I'm gonna surrender.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.860]   I'm gonna go not with the people inside of the wall,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.060]   I'm gonna do what's uncomfortable,
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.500]   and I'm gonna go after the family of God.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.900]   I'm gonna surrender to God's way,
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.780]   even if it costs me, even if I'm afraid.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.180]   I'm gonna surrender my story.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:22.820]   Which he did, God began to rewrite it.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.380]   And he can do the same for you, same for me.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.500]   Like I said with me, that he has taken somebody
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.820]   that for years and years spent looking at pornography,
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.860]   and he changes the label and says, I will make you pure.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.540]   He can take you as someone who is depressed,
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.300]   and say, I will bring about and restore
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.940]   the joy of salvation in your life.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.220]   That's what I do.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:47.460]   If you surrender to me, I am a label changer.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.500]   I am a God who takes things,
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.940]   and he takes people that were abused,
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.380]   and he makes them whole.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.460]   He takes those who felt unwanted,
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.460]   or one night stands, and makes them valued.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.060]   Those who were bulimic, and makes them healed.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.660]   Alcoholic, and makes them free.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.740]   Those who felt unwanted,
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.060]   and he changes them and makes them desired.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.380]   It's what he does.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.820]   But it happens when you and I step into the family of God
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.100]   and allow Jesus and our relationship to him
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.740]   to be the thing that covers us.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.820]   And just like with Rahab, whatever part of your story,
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.580]   your past, he takes labels that the world says define you,
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.100]   and he says, I've covered those,
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.180]   and I'm redefining the future that you have.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.260]   I'm redefining the life.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.420]   I'm redefining who you are,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.020]   and those labels no longer define you,
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.460]   because what I did on the cross now defines you.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.340]   And Rahab would no longer be known as Rahab the prostitute.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.620]   And I love this, and I'm about to land the plane.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.620]   There's one time in all of the Bible
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.820]   when Rahab is mentioned,
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.860]   and her label is not.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.380]   It's only one.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.500]   Every other time, it's Rahab the prostitute,
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.020]   Rahab the prostitute, Rahab the prostitute.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.900]   Except in Matthew chapter one,
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.500]   when Matthew writes the genealogy of Jesus.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.340]   And we've read it.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.700]   I'm gonna read it again.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.620]   "Salmon was the father of Boaz,
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.700]   "whose mother was Rahab."
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:27.300]   Not Rahab the prostitute, just Rahab.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.620]   Isn't it fitting that Matthew,
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:36.780]   who lived so much of his life with a label
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.660]   until he met Jesus and went from Matthew the tax collector
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.740]   to Matthew the disciple, the author of the Bible,
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.940]   or one of the books of the Bible,
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.940]   that he would write out,
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.220]   and he's gonna write out the lineage,
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.700]   and if anybody knew labels, it was him.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.420]   And he writes out, and he says,
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.420]   "His mother was Rahab."
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.980]   That's it.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.180]   Because her connection to Jesus
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.780]   overshadowed the label that she carried.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.060]   She's written, and that's the line of Jesus.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.340]   Eventually, four verses later,
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.540]   it talks about Jesus, the Messiah.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.580]   It's tracing up.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.820]   And in so, her connection overshadowed,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.700]   her relationship with Jesus overshadowed
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.700]   the labels she had carried from her past,
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.100]   from her present, from her sin.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.420]   And Matthew distinctly knew,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.620]   when you step in a relationship with Jesus,
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.460]   everything in your past, everything in your present,
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.340]   every sin in your life, it is overshadowed by Jesus,
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.940]   and redefined, and covered by him.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.540]   And that is the most significant thing about you,
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.740]   if you're in this room, and you've trusted in Christ.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.940]   No matter what's in your future, your past,
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.100]   if you're in Christ, you're a part of the family of God.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.580]   And those labels don't define you.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.260]   Your relationship with him does.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.900]   We're told that, in the story,
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.980]   the way that she was saved
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.700]   is through a scarlet rope.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.860]   They said, the only way we will know it's your house
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.460]   is if this scarlet rope runs outside of it.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   And anyone who is inside of the house that is marked
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.140]   by this red rope, scarlet rope on the outside,
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.900]   anyone inside of that will be saved.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.500]   Everyone outside of that, anyone that is not in a house
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.980]   that is marked by a scarlet rope, will perish, will die.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.580]   So make sure that the scarlet rope hangs outside.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.060]   Clearly a foreshadowing of Jesus.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.300]   Just like in the Passover,
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.980]   where the blood was covering the house.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.740]   So in this scenario, where a scarlet rope,
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.260]   a scarlet thread, representing the blood of Christ,
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.860]   that anyone who has this marking their life by faith
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   in Jesus will not perish, but have eternal life,
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.700]   will be saved.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.020]   And anyone who does not have that marking,
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.420]   in other words, the work of what Jesus did,
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.700]   pouring his blood out for you on the cross,
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.260]   marking your life by accepting it,
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.260]   his payment by faith, I believe, will perish.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.220]   And that same gift has been extended
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.940]   to anyone who will accept it by faith.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.200]   God has given his life and extended the covering for you.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.260]   You've got to accept it, that I'll never be enough.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.100]   And I can face the battle, and I can face the war,
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.900]   and I can face all that life is gonna throw at me,
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.320]   but I'll never earn a relationship with God.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.220]   But I don't have to, but I do have to accept it.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.940]   And let the scarlet blood of Christ cover me
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.600]   like the scarlet rope covered her.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.980]   Let me pray.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.260]   Father, I pray that anyone who has never had a moment
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.140]   in their life where they make the decision
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.180]   to trust in what you did on the cross,
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.040]   paying for their sin, paying for past abortions,
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.980]   current addictions, current messed up relationships,
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.520]   abusive behavior, today would be the day
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.620]   that they would stop attempting to earn their way to you
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.140]   and just say, God, I accept it.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:11.060]   I accept that you died for me on that cross,
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.480]   and that you would seek after and rewrite their story.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.860]   I pray for people who, candidly, no matter how hard
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.380]   I try to plead with them to not buy the lie
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.780]   that the God who's there rewrites stories
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.700]   and takes broken things and ashes
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.900]   and makes beauty out of them,
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.020]   that now your spirit would pierce through their heart
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.500]   and they would believe, no matter how far they've run,
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.820]   no matter how far they've fallen,
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.660]   it is not too far for the grace and goodness of God.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.780]   And they would experience and encounter you,
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.400]   and you would, through their surrender,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.960]   write beautiful marriages, restore families back together,
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:52.020]   bring healing, peace, and joy.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.740]   It's what you do, it's what you've always done,
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.660]   and the story of Rahab showcases
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.440]   you came for sinners like all of us.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.900]   You're greater than the labels that define us in the past.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.460]   You're greater than the ones that define us right now.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.900]   You're greater than it all,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.140]   and we worship you now in song, amen.
