 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hey, it's so good to see you.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,280
 I hope that all is well.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,400
 If this is your first time ever with us,

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,240
 thank you so much for trusting us with your Tuesday night.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,800
 My name is Timothy Atik.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,640
 I'm one of the teaching pastors here at the porch,

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,960
 as well as on Sunday mornings at Watermark.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,640
 And I'm so glad you made it.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,840
 I want to give a big shout out to all of our Porch Live

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,560
 locations that are joining us tonight

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,160
 in different parts of the nation.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hope all is well with you.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,040
 And I'm so glad that you are worshiping with us.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,840
 Tonight, it's a sweet moment for me,

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,060
 because I get to introduce you to one

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,400
 of my very close friends.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,560
 And you're going to have the opportunity

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,400
 to hear from him tonight.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,520
 My good friend, Kylan Perry, is here

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,000
 to communicate the word of God.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,200
 And he's here from Houston, Texas,

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,880
 if there's any Houston people here.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,200
 What you need to know about Kylan

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,600
 is that he went to Texas A&M University, which

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
 is kind of important.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
 But the way Kylan and I know each other

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
 is that we served together at Breakaway Ministries

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,800
 for over three years.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,280
 And what I really loved about Kylan

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,560
 is that he gave his 20s to Jesus.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,320
 And now as he steps into his 30s, nothing has changed.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,120
 And so when I think about young adults in my world

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,200
 that are leveraging their lives for the sake of the gospel,

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,840
 Kylan is the one that comes to mind.

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,280
 And what I love about Kylan is that now he

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,680
 is the director of Houston Metro, which

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,800
 is a Bible study that meets on Tuesday nights.

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,160
 So just like we are gathering here tonight,

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,040
 there is a group of young adults meeting at Houston's First

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,480
 Baptist Church in Houston right now.

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,600
 And they are lifting up the name of Jesus together.

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
 And I'm so glad that Kylan is here

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,400
 to do that with us tonight.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,680
 So in just a moment, he's going to come up.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,600
 But before he does, I just want to pray.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
 And I want to give you an opportunity

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
 to prepare your heart to hear the word of God taught.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
 And so would you just take a second and pray for yourself

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,120
 and just say, God, would you speak to me tonight?

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:52,520
 [SILENCE]

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,000
 And then would you take a second and pray for Kylan

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,880
 and just say, God, would you speak mightily

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,000
 through Kylan tonight?

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,240
 Lord Jesus, you know how much I enjoy hearing

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,720
 Kylan teach the word of God.

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,000
 And I think he is just one of the most gifted, authentic

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
 communicators of truth.

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,760
 And so I'm so glad that these friends

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,600
 get to hear him tonight.

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,280
 But more than anything, more than they

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,440
 get to hear from Kylan, I pray that they would just

63
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,840
 hear from you, that you would speak through Kylan

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,800
 to your people.

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,000
 Would you use him for your glory?

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
 But would you speak directly to our hearts?

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,760
 May we hear from you.

68
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,320
 We thank you that you've given us your word

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,680
 so that we might hear from you.

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,960
 We love you in Jesus' name.

71
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,440
 Amen.

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,920
 Would you guys welcome Kylan Perry?

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,680
 [APPLAUSE]

74
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
 What's up, porch?

75
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,720
 So good to be with you this Tuesday night.

76
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,360
 TA just introduced me, but I'll do it just for the sake

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,720
 of making friends with the room.

78
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,480
 I'm Kylan, a young adult pastor in Houston, Texas.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,600
 I heard some friends from Houston are in the room.

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,040
 [CHEERING]

81
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,560
 It's good.

82
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
 Glad you guys made it.

83
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
 It's also so fun to be in Dallas.

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
 And I'm not just saying that because I

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,640
 need to make alliances with y'all real fast in order

86
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,840
 for you to like me.

87
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,200
 I'm saying that because I have a lot of love for the city

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,720
 because the city has meant so much to me.

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,760
 First and foremost, my wife is from Dallas,

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,600
 and I get to carry a piece of this town with me 24/7.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,960
 So I love the chance to know that.

92
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,120
 And then I have a lot of love for Dallas

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,320
 because the ministry that I lead is from here.

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,040
 Like we are in Houston, and yet we were a porch live location.

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
 And then as we just started to see God doing something really

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
 unique in our city, similar to what he's doing here,

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
 we just started processing with a team, with Josiah.

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,120
 And we just started talking about, man, God,

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,720
 would you do something like what you're

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
 doing in Dallas and Houston?

101
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,080
 And so we set off.

102
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,600
 They commissioned us well, and we're seeing God do it.

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,040
 He's doing something really unique in our generation.

104
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,480
 And then I'll say this.

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,360
 I have so much love for Dallas because I

106
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
 have a lot of love for TA.

107
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,520
 TA has-- and I'm not just paying empty compliments.

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,560
 I was really judicious about thinking through this

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,240
 before walking up here and paying this.

110
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
 He has single-handedly marked my leadership more than anybody

111
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
 else that I know of.

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,640
 And he is quite possibly one of the most faithful people I know.

113
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,240
 And so, Porch, you're in really good hands.

114
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,720
 And I'm grateful to see what God does over the course of his

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,960
 time here with all of you.

116
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
 I'm excited to dump into the word with you,

117
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,000
 but before we do that, can I tell you a story?

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,800
 So a few years ago, Halloween was rolling around,

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,560
 and I had a group of friends that they

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
 were wanting to throw a murder mystery party.

121
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,640
 Anybody been to a murder mystery party before in here?

122
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,560
 So they've got a murder mystery party going on.

123
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
 And I'm not going to lie.

124
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
 I'm pretty skeptical about it.

125
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,560
 I don't really know.

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
 OK, we're going to dress up, put on costumes,

127
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,240
 and get some sort of identity that we're

128
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,360
 supposed to act out over the course of the evening.

129
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,680
 Like, I'm not a thespian, so I'm not

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
 real sure how this evening is going to go.

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,520
 And yet, I show up, and people were all in, like mobsters,

132
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,000
 flappers.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
 It's 1920s themed.

134
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,320
 And so everybody is acting the part to the full.

135
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,920
 And they're not just looking the part.

136
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,400
 Like, they're genuinely acting it.

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,840
 With every single person came an envelope

138
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,760
 that gave a unique identity.

139
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
 And in that envelope, as you read

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,120
 through the characteristics of your unique identity, what

141
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
 you found is it carried with it things that would

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,320
 be typical of your normal life.

143
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,520
 It would tell you about who your alliances are,

144
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,920
 and who your enemies are, and what your job struggles have

145
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,080
 been.

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,280
 It was all the regular details of normal life.

147
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,320
 And so everybody in the room, they are dressed to the nines.

148
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,800
 They have envelopes with information

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,760
 about who they're supposed to be that evening.

150
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,360
 And everybody is full tilt. They are all the way

151
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,080
 in, wanting to play this game as well as possible.

152
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,680
 And so I walked in skeptical, but man,

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,920
 I don't play to participate.

154
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
 I'm here to win.

155
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,040
 And so they flash the lights, guy falls out,

156
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
 and next thing you know, the murder's happened.

157
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,360
 And I'm a police chief.

158
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,920
 Like, that was my role the night of.

159
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,080
 And so I'm out there doing my due diligence.

160
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,040
 I'm collecting evidence.

161
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
 I'm conducting interviews.

162
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
 I'm making sure that I'm going to get

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,280
 to the bottom of whoever this murderer is.

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,920
 I am going to win the evening.

165
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,840
 And then intermission happens.

166
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,600
 We make it a couple hours into the game,

167
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,800
 and the lights come back up, and everybody

168
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,040
 breaks character for a moment and gets a sip of water.

169
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,280
 And what we find out is that there's more information

170
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
 for us to learn.

171
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,840
 And so I get a new envelope, which

172
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,560
 contains four very important words that

173
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,600
 changed the entire course of my evening.

174
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,800
 You are the murderer.

175
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,320
 [LAUGHTER]

176
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,200
 Exactly.

177
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,560
 So you can imagine what happened to me in this moment.

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
 Literally, the entire time that I've been playing this game,

179
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,640
 I have been angling in one direction.

180
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,240
 But in this moment, everything changed for me.

181
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,320
 Like, I had to absolutely adapt to the fact

182
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,520
 that I could not be who I had been.

183
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,480
 Like, I knew in that instance, I had

184
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,400
 to be different things to different people.

185
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,320
 I had demands that I had to satisfy,

186
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,600
 because I wasn't safe with anyone.

187
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,040
 If people found out who I was and I was exposed,

188
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,440
 it would mean the end of my night.

189
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
 And why do I tell you that?

190
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,320
 For a couple of reasons.

191
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,200
 Number one, to brag about the fact that I never got caught.

192
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,120
 [LAUGHTER]

193
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
 And number two, to demonstrate how similar this

194
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,320
 is to the way so many of us live,

195
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,400
 except we're not in a game.

196
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,880
 So many of us feel like we have to be different things

197
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,280
 for different people because we're not safe being

198
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,920
 the real us with anyone.

199
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,360
 Like, the world is propagating this message.

200
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,280
 Like, hey, you do you, bro.

201
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,560
 And yet, too often, we realize, like, me being me

202
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,960
 isn't quite enough.

203
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,960
 And so we start contorting ourselves.

204
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,880
 We contort ourselves professionally, and socially,

205
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,520
 and romantically, and even spiritually,

206
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,920
 because we're just trying to be enough for everybody

207
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,120
 out there, and to the point that we've contorted ourselves

208
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,240
 so much that we don't even recognize ourselves anymore.

209
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,040
 Does this sound like you?

210
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
 This is my story.

211
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,600
 And the reason why I wanted to unpack this scripture tonight

212
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,680
 that we're going to be walking through

213
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
 is because this is the greatest lesson God has taught me

214
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
 in the last three years, 2 and 1/2 years,

215
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
 that I've been in the city of Houston.

216
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,080
 And so I want you to learn from my experience.

217
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
 And it's not only a story that's personal to me.

218
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,360
 It's a story personal to the guy that we're actually

219
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,160
 going to be looking at together tonight.

220
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,640
 We sang about him tonight, the God of Jacob.

221
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,520
 We're going to look at Jacob's life.

222
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,640
 And so if you have a Bible, you can turn with me

223
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
 to the book of Genesis.

224
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
 That's book number one, so you won't have to work hard

225
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,160
 to find it.

226
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,200
 But what you'll find is that as we come to meet this guy named

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,480
 Jacob, he is one of the patriarchs in the Bible.

228
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,880
 He is a hero of the faith.

229
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,320
 And he is absolutely a scoundrel.

230
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,840
 Like, the guy is a con artist, man.

231
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,200
 Like his name, Yaakov, say Yaakov with me, Yaakov.

232
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
 Congrats, he just spoke Hebrew.

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,000
 Yaakov means usurper or supplanter.

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,520
 Like his identity is one that says, man,

235
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,440
 I am going to swindle my way into getting whatever it is

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
 that I want.

237
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,840
 And as you read over the course of his life,

238
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,160
 which we're not going to do together tonight,

239
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
 but you can take my word for it.

240
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,600
 As you read his story, you find that's exactly what he does.

241
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,360
 Like he finesses his way into getting everything

242
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,200
 that he wants.

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
 He becomes whatever he needs to become to achieve whatever

244
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,280
 he wants to achieve.

245
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,340
 Because he's really just not happy with the way

246
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,240
 that God made him.

247
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,200
 And so we're going to look at his story tonight.

248
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,600
 And what we find as we read along is that he's in a moment

249
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,080
 where all of his identity issues are about to be confronted

250
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,720
 because God shows up.

251
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,860
 And so it's in Genesis chapter 32,

252
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,120
 as all of you turn there,

253
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,520
 that we read these words,

254
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,200
 verses 22 through 24.

255
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,840
 It says this, and you can catch it on the screens as well.

256
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,760
 "The same night he arose and he took his two wives,

257
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,880
 his two female servants and his 11 children.

258
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,840
 And he crossed the Ford of the Jabbok.

259
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,880
 He took them and sent them across the stream

260
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,640
 and everything else that he had.

261
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,300
 And Jacob was left all alone."

262
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,360
 So we can't see it in these verses

263
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
 because we were really catching this movie

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400
 in the middle of its showing.

265
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,480
 And yet what we need to know is that the context

266
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,080
 around this story, it is critical in order for us

267
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,920
 to understand what exactly is going to happen.

268
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,840
 How is God going to confront all of Jacob's

269
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,000
 identity problems?

270
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,920
 What's he going to do?

271
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,560
 Well, we have to understand the context here

272
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,360
 is that Jacob is really in a moment where he's trying

273
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,080
 to preserve his life.

274
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,680
 He's doing what Jacob does.

275
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,520
 He's angling and maneuvering,

276
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,760
 and he's trying to make sure that he can keep everything

277
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,440
 that he's worked so hard to accumulate.

278
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,880
 Because his brother Esau is on his way to meet him,

279
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
 which sounds like a nice family reunion.

280
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,840
 And yet the truth of the matter is that's not exactly

281
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,760
 what's going to happen.

282
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
 Jacob is the brother that he swindled out of all

283
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,640
 of his inheritance.

284
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,480
 He was the firstborn, Esau,

285
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,400
 and yet Jacob convinced his father to give him

286
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,120
 the blessing instead.

287
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,040
 He deceived him.

288
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,160
 He lived up to his name.

289
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,200
 And what we know is because of that,

290
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,280
 Jacob has inherited all sorts of wealth and property

291
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,560
 and just prominence in the region

292
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,920
 that deservedly belonged to Esau.

293
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,640
 And so Esau's on his way to meet his brother.

294
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,080
 They haven't talked since Jacob stole everything

295
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,440
 and snuck out the back door.

296
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
 And Esau's on his way, not by himself,

297
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,840
 but with 400 armed men.

298
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,800
 What do you think is playing through Jacob's mind right now?

299
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,160
 Payback, like this guy is about to come get

300
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600
 his pound of flesh.

301
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,400
 Like he wants to take me out and take everything

302
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,600
 that I took from him.

303
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,440
 And so what does he do?

304
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,440
 It says he starts trying to buy his brother off.

305
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,840
 He sends over all of his possessions,

306
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,560
 all of his property, even his own family,

307
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,920
 until he's at a point where he is totally left by himself.

308
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,980
 He is all alone.

309
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,440
 And then that's when God shows up.

310
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,080
 Like it's not coincidental that God will only confront

311
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,080
 Jacob's identity issues when Jacob is at last alone.

312
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,480
 And the same is true for you and I.

313
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,840
 That if you want to get to the bottom

314
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,700
 of your identity crisis, your problem, your issues,

315
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,960
 then the first thing you need to know

316
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,560
 is that you have to stop hiding behind other things.

317
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,280
 You have to stop hiding behind other things.

318
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,520
 This is the way that God will work in our lives

319
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840
 as he tries to establish and affirm

320
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,860
 his God-given identity to us.

321
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,280
 It isn't until we're truly alone with God

322
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,440
 that we're truly available to God.

323
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,400
 Then until we separate ourselves from the various things

324
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,600
 that we find our identity,

325
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,680
 and I don't know what it is for you,

326
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,760
 but I know for myself, like before I worked in ministry,

327
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 I found my identity in my job and in my relationship status

328
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,000
 and how much money I was making

329
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,560
 and what my friends thought of me.

330
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,820
 Every one of us is identifying with something other

331
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,680
 than God himself to find some sense of security

332
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,660
 in this life.

333
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,700
 So what's it for you?

334
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,280
 But it's only after all of those things

335
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,800
 are rid from your presence,

336
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,560
 when everything is removed from you,

337
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,400
 that you become available for God to actually fix.

338
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,320
 You see, you have to be vulnerable to become fixable.

339
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,440
 Anybody work in the medical field here?

340
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,160
 Yeah, they're quiet.

341
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
 They don't speak up.

342
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,880
 What they would tell you is that you have to,

343
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,640
 in order to properly clean a wound, to dress a wound,

344
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,160
 you have to properly expose the wound.

345
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,840
 I remember I was 14 years old,

346
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,680
 hooping in the driveway with my best friend.

347
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,920
 We're doing what boys do.

348
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,240
 Like we're out there, we lower the rim

349
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,680
 and we start yamming it because we want to feel big,

350
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
 you know, and I'm out there and I'm like,

351
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,800
 okay, I've got a one up my buddy.

352
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,040
 And so I decided to do Vince Carter's famous,

353
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,920
 like arm through the rim dunk.

354
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,280
 And so I go up and I stuff myself on the rim.

355
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,200
 I fall to the asphalt.

356
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,600
 And as I hit the asphalt, I break my elbow.

357
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,080
 So we get up, we drive to the hospital.

358
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,160
 And as we're on our way to the hospital, we pull in.

359
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,300
 I'm devastated, trying to hold it together,

360
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,880
 but certainly having a difficult time with it all.

361
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,640
 And so we walk in and they begin to prepare to set it.

362
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,280
 But before they can set my elbow,

363
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,520
 they have to clean it because it was full of black asphalt.

364
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,920
 And so my nurse, this mountain of a man from East Texas,

365
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,800
 walks in with a little bitty scrubby brush

366
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,400
 and he just starts working my elbow.

367
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,320
 Like he is working so hard to clean the wound.

368
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,580
 And he told me, hey, I have got to properly clean the wound.

369
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,440
 I have to expose the wound in order for us

370
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,380
 to dress this thing and set it correctly.

371
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,020
 The same is true with your identity.

372
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,280
 It has to be exposed.

373
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,920
 We have to be exposed if God is going to fix

374
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,520
 that which needs to be fixed in our life.

375
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,940
 We must remove anything that we would normally find security

376
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,960
 in until we are vulnerable enough for him to do his work.

377
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,240
 And from Jacob's example,

378
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
 we learned that we typically find security

379
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
 in one of two places.

380
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,640
 We didn't read it, but if you go and you look at verses 13

381
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,840
 to 21 in this chapter, you see that Jacob,

382
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,880
 it lists out all the things that he owns and sends away.

383
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,080
 And it falls into two categories, trophies and titles.

384
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,920
 Trophies and titles.

385
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,740
 What are trophies?

386
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,920
 Trophies are the possessions that we acquire

387
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,220
 by adapting our identity.

388
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,280
 These are the things that your paycheck purchases for you.

389
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,200
 What your money goes to at the end of the day,

390
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,680
 the car you drive, the place you live in,

391
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,040
 the clothes you wear, whatever it is

392
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,920
 that you spend your money on.

393
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,520
 Like these are the trophies that you want to,

394
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,320
 you want to be associated with in your life.

395
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,960
 For Jacob, this was his property, his servants.

396
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,840
 This is all of his wealth.

397
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,080
 Like he sends all of this stuff to his brother

398
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
 because he doesn't want his brother to come

399
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,620
 and do poorly with him.

400
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,840
 In the same way, we find so much of our identity

401
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,020
 in the things that we own, but it's not just that.

402
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,900
 It's also in titles, the positions that we acquire

403
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,140
 by adapting our identity.

404
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,100
 For Jacob, because he stole from his brother

405
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,420
 and he was trying to angle his way into security,

406
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,260
 what did he find?

407
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,580
 He became a husband and a father and an employer

408
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,360
 and a property manager.

409
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,200
 For you, it's going to be, man, I work in this job

410
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,900
 or I'm the most popular amongst my friends.

411
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,160
 I'm the best looking in the room.

412
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,500
 I don't know what title it is for you.

413
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,940
 And yet it's in trophies and titles

414
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,200
 that we find our security.

415
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,960
 God will take all of it away to fix you.

416
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,380
 He wants to pull all of it out of your life.

417
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,960
 That way you are vulnerable enough

418
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,240
 to at last be fixable as he wants.

419
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,420
 This is the first thing we see

420
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
 as God comes to confront our identity problems,

421
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,580
 but it's not the last thing.

422
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,700
 The second thing we see is in verses 24 through 25.

423
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,160
 And Jacob was left alone in a man, spoiler alert,

424
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,960
 God wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.

425
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,140
 And when the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob,

426
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,680
 he touched his hip socket.

427
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,380
 And Jacob's hip was put out of joint

428
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,320
 as he wrestled with him.

429
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,960
 So we can admit, like this story is weird, right?

430
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,420
 Like there's nowhere else in the Bible

431
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,560
 that you're going to see God show up in human form

432
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,980
 and wrestle another guy down.

433
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,900
 Like that just doesn't happen.

434
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,440
 And yet whenever the Bible puts a story

435
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,360
 that is uniquely distinct from the rest of the scripture,

436
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,560
 it's there for good reason.

437
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,260
 And so it begs the question,

438
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,400
 why is this story in our scripture?

439
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,940
 What is God trying to communicate?

440
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,520
 Well, think about Jacob's situation.

441
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,220
 What's he trying to avoid?

442
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,160
 A fight.

443
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,060
 And so that's exactly what God brings to him.

444
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,300
 Jacob is doing everything in his manipulative power

445
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,140
 to get away from fighting his brother.

446
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,940
 But it's only then that the real fight begins.

447
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,460
 He has nothing to hide behind.

448
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,180
 He's all alone, which is pretty profound.

449
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,400
 He has nothing.

450
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,360
 And then at that moment that God shows up

451
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,040
 and begins to work him out.

452
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,320
 Because you see, friends,

453
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,320
 God loves you too much to not confront your identity issues.

454
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,120
 He loves you too much.

455
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,960
 Like he doesn't want to leave you

456
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,680
 wrestling with whatever insecurities

457
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,560
 you feel about yourself,

458
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,300
 whatever anxiety hangs over you about those things

459
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,700
 that you wish you could change yet you cannot change.

460
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,220
 God wants to tackle that stuff head on.

461
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,900
 Like he wants to confront it directly.

462
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,640
 And yet too often we don't want this for ourselves.

463
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,380
 But God's a good dad in doing so.

464
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,020
 It says in the book of Hebrews, chapter 12, verse seven,

465
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,860
 it's for discipline that you have to endure.

466
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,120
 God is treating you as sons, daughters.

467
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,500
 For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?

468
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,460
 For the moment, all discipline seems painful

469
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,260
 rather than pleasant.

470
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,760
 But later it's productive.

471
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,080
 It yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness

472
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,980
 to those that have been trained by it.

473
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,060
 If you are God's son in the room,

474
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,340
 if you were God's daughter in the room,

475
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,120
 he will discipline you because he loves you.

476
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,140
 And yet rather than let God deal with our insecurities

477
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,820
 and resolve our issues, we try to do it on our own.

478
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,100
 Like we often try to take care of our own problems

479
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,620
 and deal with our own securities our own way

480
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,060
 because we don't trust him.

481
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,540
 We trust ourselves instead.

482
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,180
 And so we do it in a couple of different ways.

483
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,980
 Like oftentimes what I see as I work with young adults

484
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,540
 is when it comes to their insecurities,

485
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,980
 what they do is they try to suppress them.

486
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,100
 They try to just squeeze them down as much as possible,

487
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,580
 minimize them to the point that you cannot see them.

488
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,600
 They try to avoid them.

489
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,740
 They try to ignore them.

490
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,260
 They try to do what I did to my truck in college.

491
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,700
 Like I tried to ignore the fact

492
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,100
 that my truck had some steering issues

493
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,560
 until eventually the point I couldn't ignore it anymore.

494
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,940
 Like the steering column came loose from the front axle

495
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,860
 and I needed to turn left and we are barely straight on.

496
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,040
 Like I am stuck in a moment of absolute crisis

497
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,100
 because I didn't trust there's someone who knows better

498
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,300
 who can actually fix it.

499
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,940
 I ignored the problem.

500
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,340
 I suppressed it.

501
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,300
 Or we obsess over it.

502
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,060
 Like we're so insecure.

503
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,220
 And so we spend hours in front of the mirror

504
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,180
 just trying to make this work.

505
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,000
 Or we spend hours at the gym

506
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,980
 just trying to get the bicep to peak a little bit more.

507
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,780
 Or we just spend hours thinking about the conversations

508
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,460
 that man, I wish I hadn't said that.

509
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,820
 Or why did I, stupid, like why did I say that one thing?

510
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,420
 Like what are they thinking about right now?

511
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,000
 We obsess over the fact

512
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,220
 that we have deep rooted insecurities.

513
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,220
 When rather than just suppress them or obsess over them,

514
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,380
 we should confess them.

515
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,900
 Should just tell them.

516
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,560
 God knows, he made you.

517
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,480
 Like he literally put you together.

518
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,800
 He knows exactly the things that you feel embarrassed by,

519
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,660
 that you wish you could change.

520
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,960
 Those aspects of your identity

521
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,680
 that you're working so hard to contort

522
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,400
 and just make sense to the rest of the world.

523
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
 He's like, no man, like just come to me with it.

524
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,840
 I'll fix it for you.

525
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,760
 I can fix that.

526
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,640
 You see, the difference in who you are today

527
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,360
 and who you become tomorrow

528
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,280
 is found by way of wrestling with him.

529
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,500
 And so we don't avoid the fight.

530
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,600
 We don't run from it.

531
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,980
 He wants to engage with us.

532
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,940
 And so we engage with him.

533
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,500
 And we trust him to deal really kindly with us

534
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,740
 because that's his heart.

535
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,180
 And what we find

536
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,320
 is that it's not a very pleasant experience.

537
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,020
 I don't know what you're expecting,

538
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,220
 but if you've ever wrestled before,

539
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,580
 wrestling is anything but easy.

540
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,660
 And they don't just wrestle.

541
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,860
 They do it all night long.

542
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,980
 This is going to be difficult.

543
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,260
 And like as a peer to you, man,

544
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,660
 I just want to look at you and say,

545
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,660
 if you're signing up for this, it is for your good.

546
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,500
 Yet it will be really difficult, but it's worth it.

547
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,540
 This is what we're called to do

548
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,820
 because on the other side of it, there's blessing.

549
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,780
 That's where it goes on.

550
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,220
 As we read along, he says in verse 26,

551
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,740
 and then he said, "Let me go, for the day is broken."

552
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,580
 Come on, bro.

553
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
 Like this is sensible, man.

554
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,820
 We've been at this all night.

555
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,420
 Let me go, for the day is broken.

556
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,260
 But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."

557
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,700
 And he said to him, "What's your name?"

558
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,900
 Do you hear the question about identity?

559
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,020
 And Jacob, for the first time in his life, answers honestly.

560
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,420
 You see, if you read Jacob's story,

561
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,540
 what you find is that there's two moments

562
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,380
 where he's asked, "Who are you?"

563
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,420
 The first time, he flat out lies.

564
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,380
 He says that he is Esau.

565
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,620
 He calls himself by his brother's name,

566
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,020
 because again, he wants to become something he isn't

567
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,580
 to get something he can't.

568
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,700
 And yet in this moment, he finally just fesses up.

569
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,220
 He says, "No, man, I'm Jacob.

570
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,180
 "This is who I am.

571
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,900
 "I've got nothing else to hide behind,

572
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,660
 "and I've been wrestling with you all night long.

573
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,220
 "What more do I have to lose?

574
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,060
 "I'm Jacob."

575
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
 And he answers honestly for the first time.

576
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,260
 And what we see is it makes all the difference,

577
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,700
 because he realized he can't become something he isn't

578
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,740
 to get something he can't.

579
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,460
 I remember my first year working for Breakaway,

580
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,060
 when T and I first started out together.

581
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,780
 We would every year do this gathering.

582
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,220
 It was men's and women's Breakaway.

583
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,820
 It would be a worship gathering for the boys,

584
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,140
 and a worship gathering for the girls.

585
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,420
 And we'd bring in equally great guest speakers

586
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,340
 for both groups.

587
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,220
 And so I'm a guy on staff,

588
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,860
 and so I'm likely not gonna be with the ladies.

589
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,020
 I make my way to hang out with the boys at night.

590
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,060
 And so we're doing worship, and it's amazing.

591
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,220
 I'm sitting with our guest speaker.

592
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,260
 I'm kind of hosting him for the night,

593
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
 making sure that he has everything he needs.

594
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,340
 And then as I'm serving the room, just looking around,

595
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,820
 I noticed there are two guys,

596
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,740
 like sitting like three quarters of the way in the back,

597
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,580
 kind of like where y'all are back there.

598
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
 And they're just far enough

599
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,120
 that I can't make out what they look like,

600
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,500
 but they're sitting there,

601
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,780
 and they've got hats pulled on,

602
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,780
 hoodies over the hats, and sunshades on in a worship center,

603
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,460
 which is just suspicious behavior.

604
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,380
 You know, can we admit,

605
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,020
 why do you need shades on when the lights are out?

606
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,100
 It makes no sense whatsoever.

607
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,440
 And so I do what any sensible person would do.

608
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,460
 I go to investigate.

609
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,900
 And so I make my way over, I sneak around the back.

610
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,740
 I get close to where they're sitting,

611
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,660
 and you'll never guess what I found.

612
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:01,020
 Not two guys, but two girls.

613
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,420
 Sitting in the men's worship gathering.

614
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,580
 Are you in here by chance, the two ladies that did this?

615
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,220
 I would love to know if it's you.

616
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,060
 These two ladies are sitting in our worship gathering

617
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,220
 with all the boys.

618
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,740
 And so I had to ask them, I'm like,

619
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,420
 what are y'all doing in here?

620
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,780
 We just love this speaker.

621
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,660
 You see, they became something they weren't

622
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,780
 to get something they couldn't.

623
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,100
 (audience laughing)

624
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,540
 And that's exactly what Jacob does.

625
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,980
 And so many of us do this too.

626
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,780
 Like so many of us, we become things we're not

627
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,940
 to get things we can't.

628
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,740
 When instead, in our third step,

629
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,660
 towards working through our identity problems

630
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,860
 is we just need to start admitting who we are.

631
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,840
 We gotta start admitting who we are.

632
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,680
 That's what Jacob does.

633
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,420
 He finally owns the fact that his name is Jacob.

634
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,540
 And he's not Esau.

635
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,000
 Which is big, because this guy,

636
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,180
 he's built his entire life and his wealth and his family.

637
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,340
 His entire existence has revolved around the idea

638
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,460
 of being someone else that he thought had a better advantage,

639
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,380
 a better first step in life than he did.

640
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,260
 He built his whole existence on this reality

641
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,820
 that he was someone else.

642
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,940
 And yet in this moment, he finally just fesses up

643
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,780
 and owns that's not me, I'm someone different.

644
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,200
 And it's in that moment that finally, guess what?

645
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,700
 He gets what he's always wanted, a blessing.

646
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,060
 He lied to his dad.

647
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,660
 He deceived his brother to get the blessing

648
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,020
 that God always intended to give to him.

649
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,080
 If he would just be willing to own the fact

650
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,020
 that he is who God made him to be.

651
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,980
 Friends, God has a blessing for you.

652
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,700
 And I'm not saying what that blessing is.

653
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,100
 It doesn't mean that you're gonna get some fat check,

654
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,020
 that you're gonna be able to cash

655
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,780
 and go buy whatever you want.

656
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,340
 It doesn't mean that you're gonna get the dream job

657
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,420
 that you've always aspired for.

658
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,500
 It doesn't mean that you're gonna meet that guy,

659
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,760
 that girl this year, hate to break it to you.

660
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,200
 What it does mean though, is that God knows better

661
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,540
 what's intended for your future than you do.

662
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,020
 You can trust him with it.

663
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,660
 That's what this all boils down to,

664
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,820
 is a lack of trust in God.

665
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,700
 That God, you don't know what I need.

666
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,260
 You don't know as well as I do.

667
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,900
 I know me, you don't know me like I know me.

668
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,140
 And he's sitting here saying,

669
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,780
 if only you would trust me and admit the fact

670
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,740
 that I've made you as you are, I'd lead you into places

671
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,580
 the likes of which you'd never dream you'd go.

672
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,800
 I would take you towards a blessing

673
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,540
 that you've always wanted for.

674
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,700
 But you gotta stop relying on yourself.

675
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,460
 This is what he's doing with Jacob.

676
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,660
 And he wants us to admit the same.

677
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,500
 This is a really hard thing to do.

678
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,900
 Nothing about this talk is easy.

679
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,300
 Wrestling with God, that sucks.

680
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,780
 It's a really hard thing.

681
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,780
 I've been there.

682
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,980
 And admitting the fact that you're not as awesome

683
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,860
 as you try to make everyone else think you are,

684
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,780
 that's difficult too.

685
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,660
 It takes a great deal of humility

686
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,940
 to sit in front of God himself as well as others and say,

687
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,540
 I don't have it all together like you think.

688
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,540
 But it's in that place that God says,

689
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,500
 exactly, and I can work with that.

690
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,160
 I've made you as you are.

691
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,860
 Stop trying to be something you're not.

692
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,860
 Stop faking it, finessing it,

693
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,820
 to put on some sort of facade that fools the world

694
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,780
 into thinking you're much more than I've actually made.

695
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,980
 No, if you would just trust me,

696
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,220
 I will make you all of that and more.

697
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,020
 You see, we have to reckon with the reality that God,

698
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,880
 he didn't misassemble the parts when he designed you.

699
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,220
 Like you didn't fall into the defective pile.

700
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,260
 You're exactly as he wants.

701
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,740
 That's what Psalm 139 tells us.

702
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,220
 It says in verses 13 through 16,

703
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,860
 "For you, God, you formed my inward parts.

704
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,900
 "You knit me together in my mother's womb."

705
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,320
 Do you see like God's own hands were on your life.

706
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,820
 This isn't in my notes.

707
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,700
 Whatever the thing is that you hate about yourself,

708
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,860
 God's own hand was put to it.

709
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,300
 The fact that you don't like the way you look,

710
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,480
 the social quirks that you have,

711
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,460
 the way that you talk,

712
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,940
 that you're not as tall as you, whatever it is, man.

713
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,340
 Like God made you like that.

714
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,140
 The greatest commandment is love the Lord your God

715
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,020
 with your heart, soul, mind.

716
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,760
 Heart, we can figure out.

717
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,080
 That makes sense.

718
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,460
 Mind makes sense.

719
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,800
 Okay, let me fix my attention on you.

720
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,340
 Got affections and attention.

721
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,260
 But what is the point with loving God with your soul?

722
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,380
 How does that work?

723
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,580
 Anybody, have you ever wondered love God with your soul?

724
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,480
 I don't know, like that feels crazy.

725
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,700
 It means to love God exactly as he's designed you to be.

726
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,180
 That word for soul in Hebrew, it's the word nefesh.

727
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,260
 And it literally, it can be translated as well as breath,

728
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,260
 that God breathed into you a God-given identity

729
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,480
 and you cannot love him fully

730
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,040
 until you live into that fully.

731
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,760
 He's given you a very specific design.

732
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,800
 He formed your inward parts.

733
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,120
 He knit you together in your mother's womb.

734
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,560
 I praise you God for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.

735
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,380
 Wonderful are your works.

736
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,920
 My soul, nefesh, knows it well.

737
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,840
 My frame was not hidden from you.

738
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,160
 When I was being made in secret, intricately woven

739
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,220
 in the depths of the earth,

740
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,780
 your eyes saw my unformed substance.

741
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,440
 In your book were written every one of them,

742
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,140
 the days that were formed for me,

743
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,460
 when as yet there was none of them.

744
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,060
 Friends, I don't know if anyone's ever told you this,

745
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,900
 and I don't know how easy this will be to receive,

746
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,300
 and yet you need to know,

747
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,060
 you have been so intentionally

748
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,420
 and so beautifully designed by God.

749
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,000
 And I'm telling this to you

750
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,860
 as a guy that needed someone to speak it to me,

751
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,040
 that wanted so badly for the approval

752
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,880
 and acceptance of others,

753
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,000
 I would do anything to get it,

754
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,260
 when in reality, I am already all that God wants.

755
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,220
 I'm exactly as he intrinsically designed.

756
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,640
 Who you are intrinsically is from God,

757
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,600
 but catch this, who you become eventually is for God.

758
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,680
 This is not a license to sin.

759
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
 This is not an opportunity to say,

760
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,220
 well, God made me this way, so deal with it.

761
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,480
 Like that's not what I'm communicating here.

762
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,480
 This is an acknowledgement that God,

763
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,880
 you've made me in your image,

764
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,040
 and you have designed me for your purposes.

765
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,380
 And when we reckon with that, we can admit who we are.

766
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,520
 That's the third step.

767
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,240
 The fourth step we find in verses 28 through 30.

768
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,140
 Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob,

769
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:49,520
 "but Israel, for you've striven with God and with men

770
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,360
 "and have prevailed."

771
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,200
 And then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."

772
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,400
 But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?"

773
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,720
 And there he blessed him.

774
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,160
 I love that God asks him that.

775
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,760
 Why are you asking me?

776
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,360
 I just threw your hip socket out with the touch of a finger.

777
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,320
 It's pretty obvious.

778
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,240
 And he gets it.

779
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,800
 So Jacob called the name of the place,

780
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,680
 Peniel saying, "For I have seen God face to face,

781
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,720
 "and yet my life has been delivered."

782
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,800
 What does God say to Jacob in this moment?

783
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,320
 Like after all the frustration and the fighting,

784
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,260
 God looks at Jacob and he says,

785
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,660
 "You want a new identity?

786
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,560
 "You can't give it to yourself.

787
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,760
 "You want a new future, a new destiny?

788
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,300
 "You can't find that either.

789
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,320
 "I can give it to you.

790
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,040
 "I'm the one that gives new identity.

791
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,580
 "I'm the one that gives new destiny.

792
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,680
 "You want a new purpose?

793
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,920
 "Then come here.

794
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,200
 "Stop trying on your own.

795
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,380
 "Stop wrestling it out on your own grit.

796
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,260
 "Like just come to me and we can work together.

797
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,700
 "I've got great plans.

798
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,140
 "I'll lead you to them.

799
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,320
 "Just come here."

800
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,600
 He does.

801
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,900
 And you know what he finds?

802
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,080
 A name that to this day still describes the people of God

803
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,800
 according to our scriptures.

804
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,760
 The nation of Israel were the children of Israel.

805
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,040
 And to this day, as God has sent his own son,

806
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,720
 we have all been invited into his family.

807
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,880
 Jacob not only got a new name,

808
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,720
 a greater identity than he could ever find on his own,

809
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,640
 but he got a greater destiny.

810
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,080
 He got to live towards something

811
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,920
 that would be a blessing to everyone.

812
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,840
 And the same can be true for you.

813
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,520
 How?

814
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:36,600
 When you have seen God face to face and yet been delivered.

815
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,920
 When you meet Jesus Christ,

816
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,200
 who is God in the flesh,

817
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,960
 face to face with you and me

818
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,040
 and wanting to give away new identity,

819
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,920
 wanting to call you by a new name,

820
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,680
 wanting to invite you into new purpose,

821
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,800
 wanting to assign you to a new destiny.

822
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,560
 That's what happens whenever we come into,

823
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,080
 whenever we place our faith in God

824
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,440
 and we enter into his family,

825
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,920
 what we find is everything changes.

826
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,480
 You want stuff to change?

827
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,320
 All you have to do is believe.

828
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,600
 And (snaps) that fast.

829
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,560
 It's all different.

830
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,960
 You see, when you place your faith in Jesus,

831
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,560
 what 2 Corinthians tells us

832
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,160
 is that God gives you a new identity.

833
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,200
 He gives you a new identity.

834
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,760
 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,

835
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
 he is a new creation.

836
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,680
 The old has passed away.

837
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,200
 Behold, the new has come.

838
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,320
 That once you place your faith in Jesus,

839
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,480
 he gives you a new destiny, 1 Peter 2, 9.

840
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,160
 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,

841
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,720
 a holy nation, a people for his own possession,

842
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,040
 that you may proclaim the excellencies of him

843
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,200
 who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

844
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,320
 This is available to you

845
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,520
 if you do the fourth and final step,

846
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,680
 if you at last start accepting what God says about you,

847
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,240
 that I've got a new name and I've got a new purpose.

848
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,880
 I can give you new identity.

849
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,360
 I can give you new destiny.

850
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,240
 Just come to me.

851
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,040
 And the reason we all know it's true

852
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,000
 is because God has sent his own son

853
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,640
 to change you in ways the likes of which

854
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,240
 you could never change yourself.

855
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,680
 So friends, stop hating your hardwiring.

856
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,600
 Stop indulging your insecurities.

857
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,440
 Instead, embrace the fact

858
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,460
 that your story is forever different

859
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,120
 because Jesus, the son of God,

860
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,480
 the long-proclaimed Messiah,

861
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,320
 entered into our story and he changed it forever.

862
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,480
 You see, Jesus, when he came in the flesh,

863
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,080
 the son of God became the son of man.

864
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,520
 When he stepped into our world,

865
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,760
 what we knew is that Jesus never once hid who he was.

866
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,360
 Like, he always made perfectly clear,

867
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,200
 "Hey, I am who I say I am.

868
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
 "I'm perfect, I'm totally secure.

869
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,120
 "I'm unafraid of anything."

870
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,280
 Sure, sometimes he would veil it,

871
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,480
 but it was to accomplish God's greater good.

872
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,400
 But when it mattered, at the final moment,

873
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,280
 he didn't hide at all,

874
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,640
 but he bore his identity fully

875
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,240
 that the world might find their own,

876
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,480
 that we might not hide any longer.

877
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,160
 Jesus, he never ran from the fight.

878
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,240
 Like, every single one of us enslaved to our sin.

879
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,320
 We were bound and captive, led into darkness,

880
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,280
 and yet Jesus Christ, he didn't run away

881
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,000
 from what was a really terrifying situation.

882
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,040
 He ran straight into it.

883
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,360
 He entered into the fray.

884
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,200
 He crossed the halls of heaven

885
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,440
 and the corridors of history to get to you and me.

886
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,640
 And he did it because he wanted you for himself.

887
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,200
 He wanted to give you a new identity.

888
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,720
 Like, he never once concealed who he was,

889
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,880
 but he admitted it.

890
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,600
 By way of living the perfect life

891
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,440
 and doing what we could not, dying the death

892
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,200
 we all deserve, the wages of sin is what?

893
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,480
 It is death.

894
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,360
 That's what we deserve, eternal separation from God.

895
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,360
 Jesus stepped into the story, not concealing himself,

896
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,640
 but admitting who he is,

897
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,000
 that by his life and his death,

898
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,400
 and then on his resurrection, he could declare,

899
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,520
 I am who I say I am,

900
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,960
 and any that would place their faith in me

901
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,360
 shall follow me where I go.

902
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,960
 And amazingly,

903
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,440
 Jesus never rejected what God said about you and me.

904
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,800
 In his life, despite the way that people treated him,

905
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,080
 despite the sinfulness of us all,

906
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,960
 Jesus knew God has called you sons and daughters,

907
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,040
 and so I will look upon you

908
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,200
 and call you brothers and sisters.

909
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,600
 When you scorn me, I'll serve you.

910
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,960
 When you mock me, I'll still meet with you.

911
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,880
 When you hate me, I'll love you.

912
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,200
 This is the heart of our God for you.

913
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,680
 You want a new identity?

914
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,920
 You got problems with the way things are?

915
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,120
 Stop trying to do it on your own,

916
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,520
 because there is infinite blessing,

917
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,560
 better identity, and greater destiny with him

918
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,520
 than you'll find anywhere else.

919
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,480
 Let me pray for us.

920
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,160
 Father,

921
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:47,720
 as I just consider God the implications

922
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,080
 of a message like this,

923
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,680
 (gentle music)

924
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,480
 a talk, God, from the truth of your word,

925
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:08,840
 so consequential, Lord, that I fear any would miss it.

926
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,640
 As I think about that, God,

927
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,960
 I just genuinely want you, God, to come and move amongst us,

928
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,160
 and that's been the heart all night,

929
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,640
 and yet, God, now in this moment,

930
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,120
 people reckon with the things they dislike about themselves,

931
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,240
 the insecurities, God, they try and stuff down

932
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,040
 or compensate for on their own.

933
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,640
 As they consider God what may feel deficient in their life,

934
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,440
 distressing even, I pray, God, we would know.

935
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,280
 You're here, and you're saying, "Come to me."

936
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,240
 For some, God, it's going to require a fight.

937
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,320
 It's gonna require a wrestling match.

938
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,800
 God, that's what it required from me.

939
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,880
 Like, I had to fight with you, Lord,

940
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,440
 and yet I'm so much better on the other side of it.

941
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,520
 And I know they will be, too.

942
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,640
 Some here tonight, God, they have reached

943
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,680
 the end of themself.

944
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,360
 They have bottomed out.

945
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,960
 And it's now, God, that you wanna work.

946
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,800
 I pray they know, Lord, though they may have been laid low,

947
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,280
 you, God, will raise them high

948
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,680
 because you pull them to yourself

949
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,280
 and you make them like your son.

950
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,280
 Others, God, they have not reached that place,

951
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,320
 but they're here tonight, and they know, man,

952
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,720
 like I'm watching these things, listening to these things,

953
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,840
 saying these things, thinking these things,

954
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,240
 going these places, behaving like this,

955
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,440
 all because I do have some insecurities,

956
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,920
 things about myself that I don't like.

957
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,360
 I'm mismanaging my money.

958
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,440
 I'm mismanaging my calendar.

959
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,800
 I'm being foolish in my conduct

960
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
 because I just want people to like me.

961
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,680
 I just, God, want others' acceptance.

962
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,280
 I just want to be enough.

963
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:03,520
 By the shed blood and body of your son,

964
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,320
 you have already declared to all, you're enough.

965
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,360
 If that's you tonight, stop striving and start surrendering.

966
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,800
 We're gonna move to a time of worship now,

967
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,840
 and it's a chance for you to stand and engage honestly

968
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,200
 in a moment with the Lord, to take off the mask,

969
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,240
 to stop saving face, and to engage with him

970
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,080
 right where you are, to not hide behind things,

971
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,840
 to not run from the fight, but to admit who you are

972
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,240
 and accept what he says.

973
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,000
 You're forgiven, you're loved, you're mine.

974
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,120
 It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

975
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,180
 you
