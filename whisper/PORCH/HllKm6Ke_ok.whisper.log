[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.240]   - All right, hey porch, why don't you join me
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.160]   as we read God's word together.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.280]   From the book of 2 Timothy chapter one,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.520]   verses one through 12.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.040]   Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.180]   by the will of God according to the promise
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.760]   of the life that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.460]   To Timothy, my beloved child,
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.880]   grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.900]   in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.020]   I thank God whom I serve as did my ancestors
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.240]   with a clear conscience as I remember you constantly
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.680]   in my prayers night and day.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.660]   As I remember your tears, I long to see you,
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.700]   that I may be filled with joy.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.860]   I am reminded of your sincere faith,
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.920]   a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.080]   and your mother Eunice,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.840]   and now I am sure dwells in you as well.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.500]   For this reason, I remind you to fan into flame
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.040]   the gift of God which is in you
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.120]   through the laying on of my hands.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.000]   For God gave us a spirit not of fear,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.880]   but of power and love and self-control.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.400]   Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.320]   about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.800]   but share in suffering for the gospel
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.280]   by the power of God, who saved us
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.500]   and called us to a holy calling,
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.120]   not because of our works,
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.680]   but because of his own purpose and grace,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.640]   which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.960]   and which now has been manifested
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.560]   through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.260]   who abolished death and brought life and immortality
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.360]   to light through the gospel,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.920]   for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.160]   and teacher, which is why I suffer as I do.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.020]   But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed,
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.620]   and I am convinced that he is able to guard
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.760]   until that day what has been entrusted to me.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.120]   Now, for our first message in 2 Timothy.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.200]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.560]   - All right, Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.400]   We doing okay?
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.080]   It's great to see you, welcome back.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.120]   If you've been here before, we're so glad
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.720]   that you would continue to give up your Tuesday night.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.540]   If this is your very first time in the room,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.180]   you picked a great evening to join us
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.040]   because we are kicking off a brand new series tonight
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.720]   that I cannot wait to get into.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.440]   But before we do, it just feels right for us to pray.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.400]   I'm gonna take a moment and I'm gonna pray for us
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.920]   and then we'll dive headlong into this.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.080]   God, thanks for tonight.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   Lord, I feel a deep sense of mine and our need
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.800]   for you in this moment, God.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.040]   These people, they do not need me, Lord.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.360]   They do not need the porch, God, they need you.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.520]   And then God, not only do we need you,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.600]   but God, we're here and we're saying to you,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.120]   we want you, God.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.840]   Like we wanna be connected to something
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.320]   that is big and bold and beautiful,
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.640]   and God, that thing is you.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.000]   And so hear us here now that God, we want you in this place.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.840]   If you agree with those words that God,
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.040]   we need you and we want you, would you just,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.440]   in the quietness of where you are, tell him that.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.280]   God, I need you.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.320]   Maybe tell him what you need him for.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.080]   In the quietness of where you are,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.520]   maybe you're here and you're wanting for more of him.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.440]   Tell him that and why you're wanting for more of him.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.120]   God, we know you're worthy of wanting,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.400]   you're necessary for needing,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.720]   and we're a people who are united by those things.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.960]   So meet with us now, please, we pray.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.480]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.240]   Well, when Brooke and I visited Rome several years ago,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.320]   we did as the Romans do,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.680]   and we made sure to hit all the hot spots along the way.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.920]   We checked out the Colosseum, we walked the Roman Forum,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.280]   we went to the Pantheon,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.000]   we made sure to go by the gelato shop.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.480]   We did what any regular tourist would do,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.760]   and yet of all the places that we hit,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.200]   there was one place that stood out above the rest for me,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.280]   that before we left Italy,
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.880]   we made sure, though it was our last destination,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.840]   it would be the most meaningful destination,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.800]   and yet it would not only strike you
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.720]   as a typical tourist destination,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.400]   because it is this little tiny building
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.800]   known as Mamertine Prison.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.400]   Now, you probably hear that and think, prison.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   I guess we'll never travel together,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.060]   because you and I have very different ideas
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.120]   about what travel looks like.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.400]   It doesn't look like going to prison,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.880]   it actually looks like trying to go on vacation,
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.160]   and yet what you need to know about this prison
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.440]   is this prison is not your normal prison.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.240]   It's a curious little place,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.160]   because it's not a place for common criminals.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.840]   You see, in the Roman Empire,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.640]   it would have been a place for the empire's own enemies.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   It's not a variety of cell blocks,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.280]   it's not multiple cell doors,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.640]   it's actually just one cell,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.920]   and that cell was reserved for those
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.480]   that were either awaiting trial
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.160]   or awaiting their own execution,
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.280]   and it is this cell that is pictured behind me
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.640]   that the Apostle Paul sat in himself
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.520]   as he awaited his own execution,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.360]   and it's within this cell that he penned his last
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.800]   and his most personal letter.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.040]   He penned a letter to his young protégé,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.200]   he penned a letter to Timothy,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.160]   and I remember as I walked into the cell,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.760]   the reason it struck me so powerfully
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.120]   is I was within its walls
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.520]   and I crouched within Paul's own place,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.160]   I opened that letter, I read 2 Timothy to myself,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.240]   and as I read those words, a thought struck me.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.200]   Paul, you lived an impactful life,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.440]   and yet this cell is a testament
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.080]   to the fact that your life ended,
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.400]   but the gospel didn't.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.800]   The gospel, it didn't die in this cell alongside you,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.560]   it pushed forward, it carried on,
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.800]   it pressed ahead, and it begged the question for me,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.080]   how did that happen?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.480]   I'll tell you how it happened.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.080]   It happened because a young man, a young leader,
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.280]   someone like you in their 20s and 30s
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.120]   heard the call from Paul,
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.440]   and he rose up, stood his ground,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.200]   embraced responsibility for the gospel,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.040]   and he continued that work
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.720]   that has made the difference in your own world.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   You see, that letter was written to a young man,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.000]   a man by the name of Timothy,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.120]   and Timothy knew, my time is now,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.520]   my turn has come, and I am praying, Porch,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.680]   that we, as young people like Timothy,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.960]   would realize our time has come
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.640]   and our turn is now,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.680]   and I'm hoping we will embrace the call
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.960]   the same way he did,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.880]   because I don't know if you've noticed,
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120]   but our spiritual heroes of the faith,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.920]   they aren't getting any younger.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.360]   Like, you can just look back over the last decade,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.640]   and we have lost great names,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.600]   the names of people like J.I. Packer and Tim Keller
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.360]   and R.C. Sproul and Charles Stanley and Billy Graham,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.760]   and I could go on and on,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.400]   but we have lost so many heroes of the faith,
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.440]   and yet, though their lives have ended,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.920]   the gospel must not.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.320]   The gospel must continue forward.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.400]   The question, though, that is confronting us here tonight
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.840]   is the same question that confronted me there in that cell
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.200]   as I crouched down against its wet floor.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.680]   Who is going to go with it?
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.960]   Who will carry the work ahead?
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.560]   And I'll just level with you.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.600]   I'm hoping it's me.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.320]   I'm hoping it's you.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.200]   Like, I'm hoping it is us,
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.640]   that God looks upon people like us
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.680]   within our generation, for our generation,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.280]   and for every generation to come
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.680]   to be the people that see the people
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.560]   that see the movement of God from eternity past
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.520]   and grab hold of it and carry it into eternity ahead.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.160]   That's what I'm hoping for,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.120]   which begs the question, how do we do that?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.440]   Well, that's what this entire letter is about.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.720]   You see, famously, people's final words,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.080]   their own swan song, often impart the most important things
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.240]   that they want to communicate,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.440]   and in this letter, we see some of those things
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.480]   from the Apostle Paul.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   He wants to tell you how you can accept the call,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.720]   you can embrace the responsibility,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.280]   you can take the baton, you can carry the gospel,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.720]   but before he tells you all the activities you need to do,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.640]   he wants to tell you the attitude
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.300]   with which you need to do it.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.780]   That's where the whole letter opens up.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.600]   That's why Hunter read us through those first 12 verses,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.320]   because it introduces to us a mentality,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.040]   an outlook, a mindset that we need to have,
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.000]   an attitude we must adopt
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.440]   if we're going to be a part of this work.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.320]   So if you have a Bible, turn with me to 2 Timothy.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.440]   As you're doing that, let me just say this from the get-go.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.920]   Some of you are here and you're like,
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.680]   dude, you are intense, and I'm not a Christian.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.760]   I am here just checking things out.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.200]   We're checking him or her out,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.760]   and I did not know necessarily
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.360]   that you were gonna be coming on so strong,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.720]   and yet let me just say,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.360]   this evening is an interesting evening,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.920]   because while every single Tuesday
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.760]   we try to open the scriptures in a way
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.600]   that appeals broadly to all people,
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.760]   this chapter is very specifically written
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.140]   to the family of God.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.940]   And so I'm gonna be speaking most specifically to believers,
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.560]   but if you're here and you don't know Jesus,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.120]   let me just encourage you with this.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.600]   Jesus has something for you here tonight too.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.160]   So let's look into what Paul has to say
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.520]   as he writes to his young protege.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.000]   We're gonna pick it up in verse six.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.960]   Paul begins, I mean, he says through the first few verses
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.680]   who he is and then who Timothy is,
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   and I love that he identifies Timothy specifically
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.780]   within verse five that he has a sincere faith,
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.240]   which means it's not a hypocritical faith.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.800]   It's not a faith that saves face.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.840]   It's not put on to others like him.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   Instead, it is a faith of genuity.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.400]   And then as we keep going, it gets into six,
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.240]   and it says this.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.800]   "For this reason, I remind you, Timothy," or believer,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.320]   "to fan into flame the gift of God,
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.380]   "which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.880]   "For God gave us a spirit not of fear,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.080]   "but of power and love and self-control."
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.880]   Now out of the gate, there's some debate
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.640]   around what Paul means when he says,
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.320]   "Fan into flame the gift of God
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   "that is in you through the laying on of my hands."
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.640]   Some commentators, they read that
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.720]   as an individual interpretation
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.200]   that Paul is telling Timothy,
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.080]   "Hey, I want you to fan into flame
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.420]   "the God-given gifts that are specific to you.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.860]   "You're a pastor, and so you need to work on your teaching
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.160]   "and your preaching and your leading and your shepherding."
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.000]   And so Timothy, you get to work on those things.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.640]   You see, they look at Timothy
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.040]   like he's the guy in high school sports
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.480]   that has all this raw potential,
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.560]   but he has none of the work ethic to actually seize it.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.400]   They're telling him,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.440]   "Hey, you need to get after it, Timothy."
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.280]   And yet what we know is while there is some good argument
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.600]   that that would be true, that's not the only argument.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.760]   In fact, I think there's a better argument
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.660]   for what he means when he says,
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.900]   "Fan into flame the gift of God."
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.960]   What does he mean then?
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.040]   Well, I think he tells us in verse seven.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   He says, "For God gave us, aka gifted us,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.800]   "a spirit not of fear."
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.100]   So what's the gift then?
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.180]   "He has gifted us a spirit of courage.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.140]   "He has gifted us, you, brother, sister,
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.840]   "a spirit of courage,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.120]   "which is why we must kindle the flame of courage."
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.620]   That's your first point.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.700]   We must kindle the flame of courage.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.180]   Like that's the attitude
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.420]   that God wants his people to walk with.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.380]   That's the manner in which we move.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.620]   But notice courage is given from God,
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.020]   which implies something really important.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.500]   It implies that courage is not your factory setting.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.020]   Like it's not your default mentality.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.860]   Fear is.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.320]   Fear is the default setting for people that do not know God.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.660]   And we get that because we're all tyrannized
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.820]   by some kind of fear.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.780]   Fear of the future, fear of failure, fear of man,
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.100]   fear of the outsider, fear of death,
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.140]   fear of not being enough.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.900]   Whatever it is, you can name your fear for yourself.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.220]   That is your default mode until Jesus.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.820]   But then Jesus steps into your story
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.220]   and he changes everything.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.260]   And as he changes everything,
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.340]   he moves you from a mentality of fear
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.140]   and into a mentality of courage,
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.860]   which is really important to understand.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.820]   Because as he gives you a spirit of courage,
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.540]   that insinuates something so important.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.060]   And I want you to catch this
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.020]   'cause I think you're gonna want it.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.020]   He gives you a spirit of courage
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.740]   because he does not intend for you
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.060]   to live a lame Christianity.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.060]   He gives you a spirit of courage
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:19.060]   because his future for you is not small nor insignificant.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.660]   He gives you a spirit of courage
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.340]   because he wants a future that is big and it is bold instead.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.820]   That is his intent for your life.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.340]   He wants you to have a courage
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.820]   that moves past low risk environments
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.980]   and steps into high risk environments
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.860]   because that's what courage is needed for.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.460]   Like no one needs courage to tell their mom, hello.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.980]   But fellas, you need courage to tell her hello.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.260]   You know, like that's different.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.660]   There's a different level of risks there.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.820]   And what we know is that the higher the risk,
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.380]   the higher the reward.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.060]   And so if Jesus is calling you into a life
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.060]   where courage must be your default setting, your mentality,
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.700]   what that insinuates is, yes, okay,
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.740]   there's going to be some risk,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.100]   but there's also gonna be some reward.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.260]   There's going to be something in my journey with him
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.940]   through this life that is going to be fulfilling,
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.340]   that's going to be meaningful,
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.740]   that's going to be worthwhile.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.260]   And we all want that.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.380]   You want that.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.860]   I know you do 'cause I talk to you
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.220]   every single week down front or out in that coffee shop
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.660]   that you walk through people that want to leave a legacy
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.460]   and make a difference and change the world
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.460]   and find fulfillment.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.060]   That's what young adults want.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.860]   And the amazing thing that Paul is telling us
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.260]   as God gives you a gift through the spirit of courage
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.620]   is he wants that for you more than you want that for yourself.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.420]   He's looking at you and he's like,
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.260]   oh, you want to leave a legacy?
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.300]   You want to change the world?
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.340]   You want to find fulfillment?
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.140]   I want that for you more than you want that for yourself.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.300]   And yet here's the issue.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.780]   If we're in agreement, God, why then isn't that my reality?
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.860]   Because we're not as courageous as we think.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:09.020]   We're not as courageous as we think.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.100]   You see, we set great goals,
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.540]   but what we fail to realize in view of our great goals
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.020]   is that those great goals actually fall short
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.380]   of the greatness of God
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.140]   and the goals he would set for your life instead.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.380]   And so what we do is rather than focusing
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.060]   on changing eternity, we focus on changing the world.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.940]   Rather than working to leave behind a spiritual legacy,
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.700]   we just focus on leaving behind a physical legacy.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.620]   When we could be making a difference forever,
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.460]   instead we just focus on making a difference today.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.300]   I'm not saying that those things are not good,
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.860]   but I am saying those things are not of God.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.860]   God wants your life to be purposed into something
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.980]   that transcends the barriers of our time
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.100]   and extends into the future forever.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.540]   That's the kind of greatness he's calling you into.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.860]   That's the sort of courage he has given you for.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.900]   John Shedd says, "A ship in harbor is safe,
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.980]   "but that's not what ships are built for."
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.100]   Some of you hear that and you're like, "Yes, I want that.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.460]   "I wanna set out onto the open ocean.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.180]   "I wanna raise my sail.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.380]   "I wanna catch the wind.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.660]   "I want to voyage into the future."
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.420]   And yet often what we know is we dream dreams
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.460]   that often are too small for God
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.500]   because we fear looking odd or different
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.340]   or strange or weird in the eyes of the world.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.020]   And because we do, hear me,
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.260]   we settle for the creature comforts
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.740]   of a casual Christian life
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:50.100]   when the radical reward of a courageous life
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.940]   is waiting for you instead.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.900]   That's why we have to fan the flame.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.340]   That's why we have to keep the fire.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.900]   That's why we have to cultivate our courage
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.940]   because while God has given us the gift,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.980]   it's our job to keep the gift.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.900]   So how do we do that?
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.420]   How do you keep your fire burning?
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.180]   Well, I'll put it very simply,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.300]   though there's a lot that we could say,
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.740]   I would just simply tell you
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.820]   what we believe in our family, Brooke and I,
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.900]   that you just say yes to whatever God asks.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.100]   That's it.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.340]   You just say yes to whatever God asks.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.780]   We have a family motto that we wanna live our lives
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.060]   on the cutting edge of faith,
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.300]   which just means we wanna live
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.020]   where the fighting is fiercest.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.780]   We know we wanna be in a place
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.980]   where God has to be greatest.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.340]   If we're in a place of life
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.740]   where God is not required to move,
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.980]   why would we wanna be there?
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.820]   We wanna be where God has to make himself known
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.340]   to be exactly who he says he is.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:54.340]   And so we say yes to him as often as possible.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.020]   Now, those yeses look different
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.940]   over the course of our lives.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.740]   Like they've looked small and they've looked big
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.740]   and they've looked peculiar
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740]   and they've looked uncertain at different times.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.060]   I mean, it's looked as small as just going across the street
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.180]   and watering the widow neighbor's plants.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.980]   It's looked as personal as taking our guest bedroom
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.260]   and opening it up and inviting a girl
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.500]   who'd been kicked out from her family
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.900]   to live with us for a season
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.620]   until she could get her feet back underneath her.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.500]   It looked as unpredictable as leaving community
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.420]   and stepping away from our city and journeying someplace
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.900]   we never thought we would live
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.500]   because there was no ministry there that needed to be there.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.340]   You just say yes to God.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.860]   Now, I'm not putting us up here as the example to follow.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.700]   We have said no far too many times
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.460]   and every single no we have lived to regret.
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.540]   And so I'm imploring you don't say no
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.180]   when God is asking you to say yes.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.540]   So where's he asking you for your yes tonight?
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.940]   Like, is it finally to come clean
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.200]   of the last 2% of your sin struggle
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.140]   that you've been hiding away and keeping in the dark
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.500]   because you don't know what people will think of you
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.700]   if you actually come forward about it all?
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.500]   Is it yes to joining region
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.180]   and actually working through your past
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.340]   as opposed to ignoring that that thing happened
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.580]   and as long as I don't look at it,
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.980]   I don't have to remember it?
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:27.900]   Is it yes to talking to your coworker about Jesus?
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.760]   And I don't mean talking to them in a way
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.060]   where you're trying to intellectually armbar them
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.620]   into submitting into devotion to Christ.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.160]   I'm talking to you about visiting with them in a way
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.720]   where you just ask them, hey, what do you think of God?
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.440]   And then letting the conversation flow naturally
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.760]   and visiting with them about the person of Jesus.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.180]   Like, is it saying yes to writing a letter
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.240]   and building a bridge with that estranged sibling,
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.040]   brother, sister that you haven't spoken to
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.320]   in weeks, months, even years?
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.500]   Maybe it's yes to answering Tyler's call
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.960]   and filling out an application
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.340]   and joining us here at The Porch
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.400]   and leveraging your life for a cause
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.240]   that is bigger than yours.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.160]   I'm not talking about the cause of The Porch,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.320]   I'm talking about the cause of the kingdom.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.240]   There is a yes that God is asking of you,
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.080]   so why wouldn't you say yes to it?
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.200]   Because listen to me, Noah, he said yes to building an ark
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.800]   when the earth had never rained.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.120]   And God used his family in the process of recreation.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.380]   Abraham said yes to following God
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.960]   when he didn't even know where God was taking him.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.800]   And it was through Abraham
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.080]   that he became the father of many nations.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.300]   Moses said yes to confronting Pharaoh.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.240]   And God, he performed signs and wonders
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.160]   as he delivered his own people out of Egypt.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.920]   Ruth said yes to Naomi,
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.400]   and God made her the ancestral mother to the Messiah.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.680]   David said yes to facing Goliath,
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.720]   and God made him king over his people.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.280]   Elijah said yes to confronting the prophets of Baal,
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.360]   and God sent fire from heaven.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.440]   And best of all, Jesus said yes to the cross
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.800]   when no man in his right mind would have.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.200]   And yet because he said yes,
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.580]   God raised him in victory over sin and death.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.520]   Why don't you say yes?
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.800]   It's through your yes
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.680]   that you kindle the flame of your courage.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.880]   You cultivate the gift God has given.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.120]   You see, you believe big about God.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.200]   You believe big about God,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.240]   and then you say yes to putting yourself in positions
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.200]   where he becomes big as a result.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.460]   And when you do, that changes everything
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.120]   about the way you lead your life.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.740]   It leads you to not just move through this world casually,
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.880]   but it leads you to embrace opportunity,
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.780]   even if it is risky,
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.920]   which is what Paul goes on to say next.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.720]   He tells us in verse eight,
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.000]   "Therefore, because God has given you a spirit of courage,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.120]   "do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.520]   "nor of me, his prisoner, but share in suffering
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.000]   "for the gospel by the power of God."
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   So we've already clarified that God has given you a courage
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.160]   that's going to lead you into a life that is rewarding,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.800]   but it will require risk.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.720]   And Paul tells you right here,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.440]   "Hey, it's gonna require two risks of you very specifically.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.920]   "It's not isolated to these two and these two alone,
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.440]   "but it certainly will be these two and these two alone."
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.880]   And I love the two that Paul gives us
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.960]   because it shows that Paul, he knows his audience.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.600]   He understands Christians very well
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.640]   because he actually points to the two risks
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   that we're often most gun-shy about
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.080]   when it comes to our faith.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.640]   Telling people about Jesus
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.400]   and suffering well whenever hardship comes.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.120]   Those are the two things that Paul does.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:54.960]   Why would he do that?
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.400]   Why would he say this?
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.240]   Because Paul knows your second point,
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.380]   courageous faith is uncensored faith.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.200]   Courageous faith is uncensored faith.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.160]   Like courageous faith,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.240]   it's unashamed of what other people think
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.640]   and it is unafraid of any difficulty ahead.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.880]   So I was thinking about how to illustrate this to you.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.480]   And I just thought, okay, if you're a sports fan,
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.600]   you're gonna understand this more than likely.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.880]   And if you're a Cowboys fan,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.240]   you're gonna understand this most definitely
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.480]   because every single season without fail,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.280]   we are unashamed of where our loyalty lies.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.300]   We didn't buy this, right?
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.560]   Like we step up and we say, hey, this is who we are.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.120]   And yet though we're unashamed of where our loyalty lies,
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.160]   we're also unafraid of the consequences
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.120]   of following these guys
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.680]   because year after year after year after year,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.080]   they don't ever seem to pan out the way
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.520]   that we're hoping they would.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.760]   Here's the thing though.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.800]   The difference between Jesus and the Cowboys
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.040]   is Jesus is undefeated.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.480]   (congregation cheering)
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.200]   Jesus has never lost.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.800]   He has only ever won,
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.480]   which means you have no reason
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.560]   to censor any part of your faith.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.880]   So why would you do it?
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.840]   Well, why do you censor anything?
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.120]   You censor something
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.360]   because you think that something is inappropriate,
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.520]   which means if you're censoring your faith,
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.960]   you think Jesus is inappropriate.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.320]   You look at him and say, hold on,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.840]   this wouldn't be right for this moment.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.980]   Like I'm at the office and so I need to censor you
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.120]   because it would feel inappropriate
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.080]   to jeopardize my working relationships
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.360]   when in reality all you're doing
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.260]   is you're jeopardizing their eternity.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.240]   You censor him when you're out with your friends
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.080]   because man, it feels inappropriate
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.240]   to kind of impose my Christian convictions
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.720]   and spoil all of the fun,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.120]   even though those same Christian convictions
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   are trying to save you from the guilt and the regret
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.820]   you know you're gonna feel in the morning.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.880]   You censor him from your social media
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.720]   because it feels inappropriate to risk your image
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.120]   to your followers when in reality,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.560]   what you're doing is you're risking your witness
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.240]   to all of your followers.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   This is the crazy thing.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.840]   Jesus never censored himself for you.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:19.680]   He was willing to be 100% of who he said he was,
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.480]   the son of God, and he was willing to do 100%
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   of what he said he would do, die for your sins.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.100]   And that is truly inappropriate.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:39.760]   And yet he was willing to live uncensored
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.100]   in his fidelity for you.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.920]   So that way now, because we have believed
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.700]   in a God who saves, we can live unashamedly
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.780]   with fidelity to him.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:00.940]   We don't have to care what anyone thinks
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.140]   because we already know what God thinks.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.780]   And we don't have to be afraid
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.220]   because we already know how the story ends.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.940]   Jesus tells us in John 16, 33,
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.740]   "I have said these things to you,
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.580]   "that in me you may have peace."
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.420]   Why, Jesus?
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.620]   "Because in the world, you'll have tribulation.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.980]   "You will have trouble.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.180]   "But take heart, I've overcome the world."
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.580]   Paul says it later when he writes
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.700]   to the church at Corinth, 2 Corinthians 4, 16, 17.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.500]   "So we do not lose heart.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.540]   "Though our outer self is wasting away,
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.040]   "our inner self is being renewed day by day.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.860]   "For this light momentary affliction
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.860]   "is preparing for us," what?
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.620]   "An eternal," not a temporal,
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.140]   "but an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison."
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.980]   Listen, Christian, you and I should never believe
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.540]   that trouble isn't coming.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.100]   The Bible has said far too much
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.300]   to convince us that it will.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.820]   We should never believe that trouble isn't coming,
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.160]   but we should always believe that hope isn't far behind.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.780]   That's why when, not if, but when trouble does come,
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.900]   we don't lose heart.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.940]   So listen to me.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.460]   If you fear that you won't have a future
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.660]   because of what you did in the past,
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.040]   in Christ, you have hope,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.860]   because shame doesn't get to write the end of your story.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.900]   If you're suffering because you have some chronic pain
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.980]   or some mental illness or some body shame,
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.280]   in Christ, you have hope,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.140]   because he has promised to replace your mortal body
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.900]   with a heavenly one.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.980]   If you lose your family, your friends,
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.200]   your loved ones out of your allegiance to Jesus,
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.460]   then in Christ, you have hope,
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.860]   because it is through him that we have new family,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.900]   we have new friends, we have new loved ones.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.220]   It's through him that we have us.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.920]   You have hope, which I know as I say that,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.860]   for those of you in this room that are suffering right now
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.380]   and that have been suffering for a long time,
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.600]   you nonetheless wonder, okay, I get that,
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.980]   I understand that I'm going to suffer.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.020]   In fact, I know that I will 'cause I am already,
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.740]   but why, Jesus, must I suffer?
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.180]   I'll tell you why.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.340]   Because it is in your suffering,
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.560]   not your strength, that Jesus saves.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.360]   It's in your suffering, not your strength,
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.740]   that Jesus saves.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.740]   It's by suffering that we comfort one another.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.980]   That's what 2 Corinthians 1, 3, 4 says.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.140]   It says, "Blessed be the God and the Father
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.800]   "of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.540]   "and the God of all comfort,
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.200]   "who comforts us in," what?
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.400]   "In our affliction, so that we may be able
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.300]   "to comfort those who are in any affliction
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.000]   "with the comfort with which we ourselves
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.060]   "are comforted by God."
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.400]   Do you hear that?
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.640]   You're more capable of comforting people
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.600]   because of your suffering than you are apart from it.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.180]   This is why vulnerability begets vulnerability,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.420]   and courage is contagious, according to Brene Brown.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.660]   We were talking, Brooke and I,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   over the course of the weekend with our nanny, Lauren,
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.780]   and she was unpacking some of the highlights
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.220]   of her time at LAUNCH.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.920]   And as she was kind of running through the list
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.340]   of all the things that she got to experience,
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.960]   the thing that kind of topped all of them
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.060]   was this evening that she had with the girls
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.420]   in her group late at night,
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.100]   and they just started sharing their stories with one another.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.540]   They just started speaking honestly with one another.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.100]   And the reason that evening was so significant
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.540]   is because as they started sharing about themselves,
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.620]   and not just the best of themselves,
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.540]   but the worst of themselves,
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.180]   the hardest things of themselves,
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.180]   what they found is that it began to comfort one another.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:52.860]   You see, in Christ, wounding can be wonderful.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.340]   Bruising can be a blessing,
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.060]   because those things actually become a bonding agent for us.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.140]   And so many of you get that.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.180]   Like, you have been in places where someone looked up
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.500]   and was like, "Yeah, man, I struggle with porn."
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.340]   You're like, "Dude, I thought no one would ever say it,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.840]   "but me too.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.220]   "Yeah, I'm bulimic, me too."
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.780]   You've been in that place.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.660]   You've heard someone identify their deepest pain,
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.180]   that thing they would hide furthest away,
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.920]   and yet they bring it into the light,
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.860]   and as they do, you feel comforted by it.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.740]   You see, suffering can save,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.220]   but it doesn't just do that.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.180]   It's by suffering that others see Christ as sufficient.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.300]   It's by suffering that others see Christ as sufficient.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.780]   2 Corinthians 12:10 tells us,
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.580]   "For the sake of Christ, then I'm content with," what?
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   "With weaknesses and insults and hardships
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.120]   "and persecutions and calamities.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.380]   "For when I'm weak, then I'm strong."
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.940]   Listen, do you know how compelling it is to people
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.420]   when they know what's happening in your life?
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.580]   Like nothing's going right, everything's going wrong,
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.740]   and yet you're okay?
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.900]   That's so confusing to them.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.860]   It's so confounding, it's so perplexing.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.980]   They're like, "Hold on, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.660]   "How are you so stable?
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.140]   "How are you so secure?
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.980]   "How are you so strong?"
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.640]   It leaves them wondering what you have
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.520]   that they and the rest of the world does not.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:25.000]   And then it compels them to understand you have Jesus,
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.100]   and they need him too.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.340]   And then lastly, suffering saves
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.220]   because it's by suffering that Jesus makes himself known.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   Jesus, he suffered for our sake.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.340]   And so if you follow him, you get to suffer.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.300]   Notice you get to, not have to,
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.560]   you get to suffer for the sake of others.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:54.360]   And that also is wildly perplexing.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   They wonder like, "Why would you give me money?
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.520]   "Like you've been saving up for that car,
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.820]   "for that trip, for that remodel,
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.320]   "and yet you've given me whatever it was you were saving
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.620]   "because you heard I had a need?
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.820]   "Why would you do that?
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.200]   "Why would you forgive me
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.600]   "when I've been nothing but difficult for you?
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.220]   "Why would you be kind to me
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.340]   "when I've only ever been hateful to you?
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.240]   "Why would you comfort me
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.700]   "when all I've ever been is indifferent towards you?"
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   And then they learn, "Oh, it's because you know Jesus.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.320]   "It's because you know a man
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.180]   "who initiated towards the unlovable,
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.120]   "who pursued the undesirable,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.560]   "who saved the unforgivable.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.180]   "That's how.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.860]   "It's not you, it's him.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.680]   "And it's him through you now."
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.380]   You see, suffering can save,
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.300]   which means fear isn't our future, friends.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.340]   Like if you know Jesus, that's not your future.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.500]   Freedom is instead.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.860]   And because that's the case,
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.200]   that's why we don't have to blur our beliefs for people,
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   and we don't have to censor our faith for others.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.180]   Like we know we can speak plainly,
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.620]   and we can share openly,
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.620]   and we can suffer peacefully
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.660]   because Jesus has made all of that possible.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.660]   We have been given a gift of courage,
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.100]   and that changes everything about the way we move.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.180]   Now, does that mean it's always gonna be easy?
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.620]   For sure not.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.460]   There's nothing easy about the Christian life.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.420]   And Paul knows that.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.120]   Like he's gonna actually tell Timothy,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.080]   "Hey, I know that you have the gift of courage,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.000]   "but I also feel like you need some confidence
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.380]   "to boost that courage."
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.500]   And so listen to what he says.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.260]   He says, in these final four verses
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.520]   that we're gonna read together, 9 through 12,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.440]   he says, "God saved us, and he called us
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.940]   "to a holy calling, not because of our works,
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.260]   "but because of his own purpose and grace,
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.560]   "which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.400]   "and which now is being manifested
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.660]   "through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus,
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.860]   "who abolished death and brought life and immortality
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.920]   "to life through the gospel,
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.080]   "for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.220]   "and a teacher, which is why I suffer as I do."
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.620]   It's a mouthful.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.460]   Paul has a little bit of a run-on sentence
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.520]   'cause he gets so excited that he finishes by saying,
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.940]   "But I'm not ashamed,
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.900]   "for I know whom I've believed,
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.400]   "and I'm convinced, not just confident,
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.180]   "but I'm convinced he is able to guard
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.220]   "until that day what has been entrusted to me."
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.060]   I love it.
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:38.060]   Paul looks at Timothy and he gives him this pump-up speech.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.900]   Like he knows, hey, I've told you what's true,
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.660]   I've called you to what's hard,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.580]   and yet you might need a little confidence boost
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.900]   beneath your courage.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.340]   He looks at Timothy and he sees what my coach saw in us
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.460]   when I was in high school with my first year
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.060]   playing high school football,
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.620]   and we were finally, for the first time in like 20 years,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.040]   facing off against our cross-town rival.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.900]   And listen, they were good, like really good.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.380]   Like they'd won state the year before kinda good
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.780]   and played in a different district altogether than us,
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.940]   and yet in this moment,
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.340]   they were coming to play against us, and we were bad.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   And I'm not being modest.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.540]   Like we were really bad.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.060]   We were not in any way whatsoever
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.860]   comparable for the competition.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.780]   And yet in this moment, our coach knew,
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.380]   hey, I'm gonna give you good courage.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.020]   I'm gonna train you, I'm gonna prepare you,
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.220]   we're gonna practice hard.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.180]   You're gonna have every reason to step into that fray
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.100]   and fight as well as possible.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.000]   And yet he also knew, though you have courage,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.540]   you need some confidence to boost that courage.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.980]   You get a little shot in the arm.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.140]   And so he walked into that meeting and he gave us a speech,
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:47.720]   the likes of which I dream about to this day.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.240]   It fills my bones as I prepare to preach.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.960]   You know, it's like that kind of moment.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.560]   It was so motivating.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.840]   It roused my inner man and it led me forth
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.720]   into the throes of battle to be utterly defeated.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.520]   And yet he did all of this because he knew,
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.760]   hey, it's one thing to have courage,
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.900]   but you also need good reason for courage.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.760]   You need some confidence beneath it.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.320]   Timothy needs the same from Paul.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.400]   So Paul, he writes this pump up speech.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.640]   He gets so engulfed by all that he's sharing.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.800]   And the reason why is because he wants Timothy to know,
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.220]   hey, true courage finds its confidence in Christ.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.000]   True courage, it finds its confidence in Christ.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.520]   It doesn't find its confidence in anything else.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.280]   It doesn't find its confidence in your ability.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.360]   It doesn't find its confidence in your social status.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.360]   It doesn't find its confidence in what people think of you
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.640]   or how well you're regarded, what your reputation is online.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.760]   It doesn't find confidence in anything but him.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.040]   And the reason we know that is he gives us four reasons
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.240]   within these four verses for that confidence.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.760]   He tells us first and foremost in verse nine
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.960]   that Jesus is the one who calls and saves.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.880]   He's the one who calls and saves.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.720]   Like, I love it.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.040]   None of us were looking for Jesus when he found us.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.440]   None of us.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.640]   Like, think about where you were when he found you.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.540]   I know where I was.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.160]   Like, I was at this cheesy little youth group conference
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.000]   out in Arlington, Texas.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.560]   And as I sat in this room,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.840]   it was this overly dramatic skit from stage
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.120]   that absolutely plucked my heartstrings
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.160]   and compelled my faith.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.680]   And I look back on that and I'm like, oh my gosh,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   like, that is the most cringe-worthy skit ever.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.840]   And yet it was through that thing that Jesus decided,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   yep, you're mine, come on.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.320]   Like, he used that because he doesn't need anything else.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.520]   He can do whatever he wants
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.560]   whenever he wants with whoever he wants.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.080]   He's the one who calls and he's the one who saves.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.320]   It is up to him when it happens and how it happens
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.400]   and with who it happens.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.720]   And so when it comes to us,
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.520]   it gives us every reason to share the gospel
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:03.080]   at all times and in all ways and with all peoples.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.560]   The second reason we have confidence
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   is because Jesus does all the work himself.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.720]   Does all the work himself.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.520]   Like it says so in verse nine.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.000]   He says, "Not because of our works,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.320]   but by his own purpose and grace."
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.920]   Meaning, listen, someone's salvation does not depend
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.360]   on your ability to get the sales pitch right.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.240]   Some of you need to hear that.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.880]   Like someone's salvation, it does not depend
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.680]   in any way whatsoever on your ability to sound fluent
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.840]   or answer all their questions
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.800]   or walk the Roman's road with them
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.760]   or present a compelling case for Christ.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   He doesn't need you to do any of that.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.840]   Like it's not about how awesome you are,
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.040]   it's about how awesome he is.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.680]   That's what saves.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.120]   He's the one that does the work.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.480]   He has done way more with way less in the past, I promise.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.000]   So say yes to him.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.840]   That's the second reason.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.000]   The third reason is Jesus abolished death once and for all.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.920]   That's verse 10.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.440]   Which is important for us to understand
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   because what that's telling us is it took,
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   Jesus has taken the sting out of that very thing
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.040]   which we should be most afraid of in life.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.400]   We have no reason to fear death any longer.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.240]   Why?
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.000]   Because Jesus neutered it of all its power.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.480]   And so what are you afraid of by sharing the gospel?
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.200]   That they won't like you?
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.240]   That they'll make fun of you?
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.520]   That they won't invite you out on the weekend?
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.760]   Like listen to how trivial this stuff is.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.960]   And yet that's the reason,
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.320]   and I'm not trying to belittle that
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.760]   because I understand a desire to be liked.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.320]   And yet Jesus is looking at you and saying,
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.560]   "Hey man, their soul is worth more than your approval.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.160]   "So tell them about me."
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.440]   That's the third reason.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.600]   And then the fourth reason is Jesus isn't a theory,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.200]   he's a person.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.600]   And I gotta be careful
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.520]   'cause I've got two minutes to finish this thing
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.720]   and I might get on a soapbox with this point.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.840]   But verse 12 tells us,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.040]   "I know whom, not what, but whom I have believed."
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:20.000]   I'm convinced so much evangelism does not work
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.800]   because we are trying to tell people
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.240]   about a concept to understand than a person to know.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.720]   We're so convinced that what they need
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.000]   are the facts of the faith.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.800]   And I'm not diminishing the significance of truth,
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.120]   but what I am telling you
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.480]   is that there's no fire within facts and facts alone.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.080]   Facts don't make followers of Jesus,
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.680]   they just make fans, that's all they do.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.640]   Like you can know all about someone
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.440]   but not actually know someone.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.480]   Jesus has not settled
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.640]   for that kind of relationship with you.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.800]   He did not live the perfect life,
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.040]   die the death you deserve,
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.360]   rise forth from the grave,
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.240]   taking up his own life in his own hand,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.640]   and then ultimately beating back all shame forever
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.120]   for those that would believe in him
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.320]   just so we could know about each other.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.440]   Do you hear how ludicrous that is?
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.920]   That's not what he's come to do.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   And yet so many of us,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.760]   we are settling for an evangelism
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.920]   that is just trying to invite people
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.400]   into that kind of dynamic.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.280]   Jesus did not die for that kind of dynamic.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.000]   He died so people would know him,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.560]   walk with him, love him, relate to him.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.800]   And I probably shouldn't say this,
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.200]   but if that's your strategy,
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.160]   you should ask yourself the question,
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.800]   how well do you know him
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.240]   or do you just know about him?
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.400]   We have good reason for confidence, friends.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.600]   God has given us a spirit of courage
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.480]   and he has given us good reason to live like it.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.600]   So let me ask you, why don't you?
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.400]   I've been thinking about this.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.200]   I've been thinking about that a lot.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.160]   I think there's a lot that we could say
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.920]   about why we don't live lives of courage,
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.120]   but why we live lives of cowardice.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.280]   And there's really plausible,
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.480]   really understandable reasons for why that is.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.280]   Reasons that are not specific to you and you alone,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   but are also inclusive of me, myself.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.480]   Like I'm not perfect at this.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.800]   I fail at this every week.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.400]   But what reasons could there be?
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.920]   Like, yes, I know it could be the opposition
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.960]   we fear we'll face from others.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.400]   It could be a neglect of spiritual discipline.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.320]   It could be some willful sin in our life.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.560]   We could number a variety of different things
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.400]   that put us in a place
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.360]   where we don't feel like we can do this.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.160]   And yet I'll tell you bottom barrel,
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   why so many of us do not operate with this sort of courage.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.400]   And the reason why is we don't think we're good enough.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.400]   We don't think we're good enough.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:04.480]   We look at ourselves and we think, me?
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.320]   No, like certainly not me.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.520]   Like I don't know enough and I'm not bold enough
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.520]   and I'm not charismatic enough and I'm not funny enough.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   And I'm not witty enough and I'm not learned enough
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.840]   and I'm not smart enough and I'm not enough.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.280]   Like that's the bottom line is I'm just not enough.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.120]   And so Jesus, you've got to find someone else.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.400]   Like I trust that you will do that.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   I believe you'll send someone else,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.680]   that you'll find someone else who will call to them.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.200]   You'll send someone else that will go to them,
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.280]   that you will send someone else who will save them.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.840]   And God looks at you and he says, I already did it.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.720]   I sent someone.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.760]   I have spoken through someone.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.800]   I have saved through someone.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.760]   And yet that someone, being the someone of Jesus Christ,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.960]   wants to go with you.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.160]   He wants to do it with you.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:11.880]   Like when we were lost in our cowardice,
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.320]   unwilling to do what we know we should do,
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.640]   Jesus, he came courageously for you.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.360]   He moved from heaven to earth
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.840]   and he navigated all the complexities
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:27.760]   and all the difficulties and all the challenges
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.160]   of our present day,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.920]   because he ultimately wanted to get to you.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.760]   And we were ashamed of our sin
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.400]   and yet Jesus was not ashamed of you at all.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.080]   He lived uncensored for you.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.160]   He moved through this world in a way
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.920]   where he never feared associating with you.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.520]   (gentle music)
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:55.600]   I wish some of you would get that.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:04.080]   That he wants you, man.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.120]   He longs for you.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.840]   He hungers for you.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.920]   He yearns for you.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.520]   So much so that he would be all that he is
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.360]   in coming to you,
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.720]   that you could be all that you are in coming to him.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.840]   And then when we were uncertain
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.600]   if we would ever be right with God again,
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.120]   Jesus had confidence that you'd be his anyways.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.920]   He knew.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.080]   He knew the cost.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.400]   He didn't second guess it.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.920]   He knew the price.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.880]   And he's willing to pay it.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.920]   He knew the debt that only he could cover.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.120]   And so he had confidence to come and to get you.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.320]   Jesus knew when his time had come
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.640]   that his turn was then and he raced into it.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   Paul, Paul knew when his time had come
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.280]   and when his turn was now and he raced into it.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.680]   The same was true for Timothy.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.320]   The question that I just wanna leave you with is,
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.960]   do you believe your time is now and your turn has come?
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.040]   And will you race into it as well?
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.200]   Jesus, thanks for tonight.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.800]   Thanks for the sufficiency of your word.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.280]   Thanks for the power of your spirit.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.960]   I have nothing good to give these people.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.520]   I have no amount of fervor, no amount of zeal,
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.840]   no amount of passion that can compel them to believe,
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.040]   that can move them to action.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.840]   I can't rattle their dead bones and bring them to life,
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.440]   but you, Jesus, can do all of that
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.720]   and you can do so much more.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.160]   And so I'm praying, God, that you would now.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.440]   God, this has just been on my heart
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.200]   as I've been thinking about second Timothy.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.320]   But God, far be it for the porch to be a place
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.760]   that is found popular.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.920]   But let it be, God, that the porch is found
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.480]   to be a place that is powerful,
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.040]   a place where you delight to dwell,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.120]   where you move amongst your people,
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.760]   where you breathe new life and you forgive old sin.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   And you change souls forever.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.240]   Would you do that work now, God?
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.680]   Please, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
