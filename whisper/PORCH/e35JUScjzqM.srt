1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,800
 - Well, what's up Porch?

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,000
 How are we doing tonight?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,620
 Hey, it's so good to see you.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,780
 Welcome to the Porch.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,160
 My name is Timothy Atik,

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,640
 and I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,160
 on Sundays as well as here on Tuesday nights.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,520
 I do wanna give a shout out

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,220
 to all of our Porch Live locations watching tonight.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,280
 I'm looking at you Midland, Tulsa, Boise.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,360
 I'm so glad that you're tuning in with us tonight.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,960
 Would y'all say hello to my good friend, Jenny Allen,

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,000
 who's with us tonight.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,400
 Hey, so here's the deal.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,520
 If you are just jumping in for the first time in a while

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,840
 here at the Porch, we have been in a series

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,440
 on the topic of prayer.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,180
 And the whole goal of the series has been

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,180
 to help us gain traction in talking to and hearing from God.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,440
 And Jenny came and joined me

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,000
 on the first night of the series,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
 and we, that was a voice crack.

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,460
 I just hit puberty yesterday.

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,820
 It's going super well so far.

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,680
 But on the first night of the series, four weeks ago,

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,280
 Jenny jumped in and we had a great conversation

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,160
 around prayer and it just felt right

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,800
 to bookend the series, having Jenny come back.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,680
 If you haven't been tracking with us,

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,800
 Jenny, you wanna say hello?

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
 I'm just talking and you're there.

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,440
 - I'm good.

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,680
 It is so good to be here.

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,040
 Y'all, we're gonna cause trouble tonight.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,240
 We don't totally have a plan for all of this.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,920
 Can I just give a little hint?

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
 - Sure.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,080
 - We're gonna pray tonight.

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,920
 (congregation cheering)

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
 Isn't that good?

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,620
 So creative.

43
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,080
 - Yeah, I mean, we were talking about it.

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,920
 It was like, okay, we'd been doing a series on prayer,

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,440
 but we haven't really prayed.

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,880
 So it felt right for us to,

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,440
 as we're doing a series on prayer,

48
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,320
 to actually pray together.

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,840
 So we're gonna do that in just a little bit.

50
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,000
 But before we do that,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,040
 I felt like one of the best things I could do

52
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
 is take you to these couple verses in the Bible

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,880
 that I think will really set us up for tonight.

54
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,120
 So if you have a Bible,

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,840
 I want you to turn in your phones to Matthew 21.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,160
 And I just wanna look at verses 12 and 13 very quickly,

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,980
 because it has everything to do

58
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,860
 with where we're going tonight.

59
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,500
 The fact that we are going to spend

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,400
 a little bit of time praying together,

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,900
 these couple verses will show us

62
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,200
 why we are going to do that.

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,520
 And it's a story in the Bible

64
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,800
 about Jesus cleaning out the temple.

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,800
 Here's what it says in Matthew 21, verses 12 and 13.

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,720
 It says this, "And Jesus entered the temple

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,660
 "and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple.

68
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,000
 "And he overturned the tables of the money changers

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 "and the seats of those who sold pigeons.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,260
 "He said to them, 'It is written,

71
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,160
 "'My house shall be called a house of prayer,

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,920
 "'but you make it a den of robbers.'"

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,440
 So here's why I wanted to start there, Jenny.

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,140
 I feel like it's a great place for us to start,

75
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,140
 because we wanna be people who value the presence of God.

76
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,400
 Like we wanna believe,

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,660
 and I know you believe this firmly in your life,

78
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,440
 that our God is a personal God,

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,320
 that he wants to meet with us.

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,280
 So when we step into this place at the porch,

81
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,360
 we believe God is here.

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,920
 He wants to meet with us.

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,640
 He wants to speak to us.

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
 In the temple, in the Bible,

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,600
 it was the place where God's presence dwelt.

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,560
 Like it was a very special place.

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,680
 The temple had a special room inside of it,

88
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,320
 known as the Holy of Holies,

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,160
 where the presence of God filled that one room.

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,700
 And only one person once a year

91
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,520
 was allowed to enter that room.

92
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
 And he would enter that room

93
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,120
 with a rope tied around his ankle

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,920
 in case he died when he was in there meeting with God.

95
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,000
 People could pull him out

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,840
 without having to go in after him.

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,560
 And so you have the temple,

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,660
 which is supposed to be the place

99
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,800
 where the presence of God resides,

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,600
 and the people of God are supposed to come

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,940
 and worship him and meet with him.

102
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,720
 But Jesus shows up, and what's going on?

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,440
 There's people who are selling animals in God's house.

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,240
 There's sheep and cows and pigeons

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
 roaming around God's house.

106
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
 And not only that,

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,880
 there's people inside of the temple

108
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,320
 who are exchanging money.

109
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,080
 Why is that happening?

110
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,760
 Well, people would come to the temple

111
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,500
 to offer sacrifices to God.

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,200
 So the reason that they're selling animals

113
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
 is because there are people from all over the Roman Empire

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,720
 who are coming to offer sacrifices to God.

115
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,200
 So they're doing people a favor

116
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,360
 so that they don't have to drag their sheep

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,000
 across the Roman Empire.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,880
 They can just show up and buy one.

119
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,560
 And the reason that they're changing money

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,060
 is that there was a temple tax

121
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,120
 that every male over the age of 20 was supposed to pay,

122
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,280
 and there was only one currency that was accepted.

123
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,000
 But you had various currencies

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
 from around the Roman Empire that were coming.

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
 And so they offered that they would exchange money.

126
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,440
 The issue is not that animals were being sold

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,120
 or that money was being exchanged.

128
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,960
 What was the issue?

129
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,760
 The issue was where they were doing it.

130
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,200
 They were doing it inside of God's house,

131
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,800
 which was supposed to be the place

132
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,080
 where people met with God.

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
 Let me ask you,

134
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,160
 have you ever had your quiet time in Walmart

135
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,220
 on Good Friday?

136
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,680
 No?

137
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
 What about at a petting zoo?

138
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,400
 Have you ever taken your Bible

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,720
 and had a quiet time at a petting zoo

140
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,640
 or at the State Fair of Texas?

141
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
 Probably not.

142
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,120
 Why?

143
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,860
 'Cause that's not the most conducive environment

144
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,640
 to meet with God.

145
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,400
 The issue wasn't what they were doing.

146
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,320
 The issue is where they were doing it.

147
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,360
 One commentator said this,

148
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,440
 "Instead of solemn dignity in the murmur of prayer,

149
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,760
 there is the bellowing of cattle in the bleeding of sheep.

150
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,280
 Instead of brokenness and contrition,

151
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,740
 holy adoration and prolonged petition,

152
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,320
 there is noisy commerce."

153
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,120
 So here's the most fascinating thing,

154
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,400
 and this is why I bring this up

155
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
 just to frame what we're about to do.

156
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,900
 The crazy thing is that the presence of God

157
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,600
 had long departed from the temple,

158
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,960
 and it was just business as usual

159
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,960
 for the people who were supposed to be the people of God.

160
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,320
 Like they had lost all awareness of the presence of God.

161
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,900
 Instead of valuing presence,

162
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,700
 they valued convenience and attendance.

163
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,160
 We don't wanna be those people.

164
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,660
 We wanna be a people who values the presence of God.

165
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,840
 We wanna be people who show up tonight

166
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,160
 believing God is here, and he wants to meet with us.

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,160
 Jesus says, "My Father's house is a house of prayer."

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,200
 Jesus wanted the temple, the house of God,

169
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,980
 if it was known for one thing,

170
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,860
 Jesus wanted it to be known for prayer.

171
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,760
 Now, this is the final thing that I wanna,

172
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,360
 this is the final point that I wanna make.

173
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
 This is the most important part.

174
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,260
 Don't miss this.

175
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,080
 What's interesting is the temple

176
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,360
 that was the house of God where the presence of God

177
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,960
 was supposed to reside,

178
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,840
 listen to what Paul says in the book of 1 Corinthians.

179
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,400
 He says, "Do you not know that you,"

180
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,960
 and in the Greek, you is plural.

181
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,960
 So he's talking to the people of the church.

182
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,480
 He's saying, "Do you not know that you are God's temple

183
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,220
 "and that God's spirit dwells in you?"

184
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,440
 So here's what I need you to do.

185
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,480
 I need you to put Matthew 21

186
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,320
 and 1 Corinthians 3 together.

187
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,840
 1 Corinthians 3 says that you, in fact, now are the temple,

188
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,000
 that we, the people of God, the church,

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,040
 are the temple where God's presence resides.

190
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,880
 What does Matthew 21 say?

191
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,140
 It says God's house should be a house of prayer.

192
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,720
 The temple should be referred to as a house of prayer.

193
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,600
 It should be known for prayer.

194
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,320
 So if you pair that with 1 Corinthians chapter three,

195
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,400
 what do we find out? That we, the people of God,

196
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 the temple of God now, should be known for prayer.

197
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,520
 So that's why we wanna be a people tonight

198
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,040
 who gather together and pray.

199
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,640
 - So I don't know how you're feeling when you hear that,

200
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,540
 that we're gonna pray tonight.

201
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,220
 Some of you, I imagine, are here and you aren't a believer

202
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,540
 and you haven't prayed ever or very often in your life.

203
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,320
 And I just wanna say, this is a really safe place

204
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,360
 to not know what you're doing,

205
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,280
 that you're not gonna experience any judgment

206
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,880
 or anything that should make you uncomfortable.

207
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,480
 This should feel easy.

208
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,400
 And if you just want to be quiet, it's okay.

209
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,680
 But I would say to those of you

210
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,680
 that don't yet know God or trust Christ,

211
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,080
 that talking to Him is an awesome thing to do.

212
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
 And asking Him, "Hey, if you're real,

213
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,260
 I would love to know you,"

214
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,700
 to talk to Him in a way that is honest and real.

215
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,140
 That is what we're going to do tonight.

216
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,500
 We're going to be honest and real.

217
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,380
 And so I actually wanna begin this night

218
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,460
 by you getting really comfortable.

219
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,460
 So if that means you spread out, get on the floor,

220
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,060
 whatever you need to do, just move around.

221
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,820
 I want you to get in a different location

222
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,220
 and posture than you're in now.

223
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,380
 So move around.

224
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,260
 Good luck.

225
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,420
 Spread out.

226
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,480
 Make a new friend.

227
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,740
 - Huh, yeah.

228
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,900
 (audience chattering)

229
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,900
 (audience laughing)

230
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,060
 (audience chattering)

231
00:10:37,060 --> 00:11:02,580
 - All right.

232
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,300
 (audience laughing)

233
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,440
 Here's how we're gonna start.

234
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,500
 I want you to close your eyes.

235
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,880
 And we're just gonna be quiet for just a minute.

236
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,900
 I want you to close your eyes,

237
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,540
 and I want you to think about your feet on the ground

238
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,060
 or where you're sitting.

239
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,320
 I want you to think about your breath.

240
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,620
 I want you to remember that God is with you,

241
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,900
 but you are also with many people who love him.

242
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:51,740
 And I wanna begin with just as honest as you can be,

243
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,340
 you in the quietness of your heart,

244
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,520
 expressing to God how you're doing with him.

245
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,900
 What is your relationship like?

246
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,500
 I want you to be honest about it.

247
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,900
 I want you just to tell him.

248
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:27,700
 Likely, in the last 15 seconds,

249
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,380
 your attention was hard to focus.

250
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,780
 It was hard to focus on prayer.

251
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,120
 And I wanna tell you, do not judge that.

252
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,500
 Just every time that your attention wanders off,

253
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,300
 just gently bring it back.

254
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,780
 Now I want you to express to God

255
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,300
 what you want your relationship with him to be.

256
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,460
 (silence)

257
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,620

258
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,780

 (silence)

265
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,740
 And I want you to ask him what he thinks about you.

266
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,900
 (silence)

267
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,060

268
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,220

270
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,540
 (silence)

271
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,700

272

275

 (silence)

276
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,180
 What are some of the things that you've heard?

277
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,300
 You can yell them out.

278

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:47,600
 So Father, we enter this night in the safety of your love for us.

293
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,400
 And we thank you that you have provided the means for us to be right with you.

294
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,400
 And wherever we are, we can come to you.

295
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,200
 We don't have to make everything right about us.

296
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 We don't have to keep our attention perfectly focused on you.

297
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,600
 We don't have to even have nice things to say to you.

298
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,400
 We can just come to you.

299
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
 Thank you.

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Now we're gonna turn our eyes to God.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,200
 And I want us to just thank him for who he is.

302
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
 That's how we're gonna begin.

303
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,200
 So we're gonna do that corporately because it's so special that we can

304
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
 and say these things out loud to God.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 So God, you are kind.

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,600
 I want you just to speak out and even wherever you are listening from,

307
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 if you're in a location with other people,

308
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 I think speak out the words to each other.

309
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,000
 And let's just pray and thank God for who he is.

 God, you are all of these things,

 all of the words that are being thought and said in the room.

333
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 God, you are beyond these words,

334
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 thousands of them being spoken at the same time.

335
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You are different than us.

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 We can't imagine your holiness and your goodness and your kindness,

337
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 and yet you set your eyes on us.

338
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Thank you.

339
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And we know because the scripture tells us that you care for us

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 and that you want us to make our requests known to you.

341
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So God, would you bring to mind the things that we need,

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 the things that the people we love need?

343
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And as God brings those things to your mind,

344
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I want you to share with two or three people around you,

345
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 and then I want you to pray together over those things.

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And if that is not comfortable for you, it's okay.

347
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Just say, "I'd rather not pray out loud."

348
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But I would encourage you to pray together,

349
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 two to three of you right now,

350
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 for the things that are on your heart.

 [music]

403
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 - Well, Lord, you tell us to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread."

404
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And so that's what we're doing right now.

405
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 We're just acknowledging what we need, and we are asking you to provide it, Lord.

406
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And so what a joy it is to be able to bear one another's burdens and to pray for one another now.

407
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And we thank you that you hear our prayers, and we thank you, God, that our lives are safe in your hands,

408
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 that you know what we need.

409
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Just as you met the Israelites' needs every morning, that there was always man awaiting,

410
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 we pray that you, God, would provide for whatever was just spoken in this place.

411
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 I pray that you would provide it in your kindness and in your perfect way.

412
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

413
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Here's what I want to do now.

414
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 I just want to ask you guys to be honest as much as you're willing,

415
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 but I would imagine that there are people in this room who would say, "Yeah, life is really tough right now."

416
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Maybe you feel like you're in the midst of a dark place or just in the midst of a trial,

417
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 what you hoped your life would be right now and what it actually is are very, very far apart.

418
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 So if you're going through a trial right now, if life is hard, if something is hurting,

419
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 would you slip up your hand real quick so we know who that is?

420
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And here's what I want to ask you to do.

421
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I want to ask you to leave your hand up, and if you look around and you see someone with their hand up,

422
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 if you're willing, would you just come around them and ask them their name?

423
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And what we want to do is we want to pray for them.

424
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And you can even take a moment and share if you feel comfortable and just say,

425
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 "Would you pray for this? Would you pray for my mom who has cancer?

426
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Would you pray that I could find a job quickly?"

427
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Whatever it is, share that real quick.

428
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And then what I want to ask you guys to do is to pray out loud for one another.

429
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And if you're not around someone who has a hand lifted up, that's okay.

430
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Would you pray for them out loud?

431
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Would you pray for the people who are hurting in this room?

432
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Take a moment and do that.

 But if you're sitting there and you don't have someone to pray for,

 pray for the people who feel depressed right now or anxious.

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Pray for those who feel suicidal.

465
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Pray for those who have a loved one who is battling cancer.

466
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Pray for people who desperately need a job.

467

 Pray for those who have gone through a breakup and are dealing with a lot of heartache.

 Psalm 40 says, "I waited patiently for the Lord.

484
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 He inclined to me and heard my cry.

485
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog,

486
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.

487
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.

488
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.

489
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust."

490
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Lord, I do pray for every person in this room who is hurting right now.

491
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 I thank you that there is not one person in this room who has to hurt alone.

492
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Lord God, that you see into the darkest places of our lives.

493
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 You know the thoughts that have been had in this room of taking their own lives.

494
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Lord, you know the people who have despaired, who feel lonely,

495
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 who feel anxious or depressed.

496
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Lord, you know those who have lost a loved one.

497
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Lord, you know those who have parents who are going through a divorce right now.

498
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Those who are having to navigate all sorts of complexities

499
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 in a friend's situation or something at work.

500
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Lord, I just thank you that you are a God who is near to the brokenhearted.

501
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 God, I pray that you would put a new song in people's mouth.

502
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 I pray that you would put people's feet on solid ground.

503
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 For those who feel hopeless, I pray that even right now as I'm talking,

504
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 they would sense you breathing hope into their souls.

505
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Lord, I thank you that you deeply love each one of us and that you're with us.

506
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 David says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

507
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 I will fear no evil for you are with me."

508
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Thank you that you are with us, even in the toughest moments of life.

509
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

510
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 I want to take just a minute and make some observations of some things

511
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 that are happening in the room.

512
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 This isn't something we do all the time together.

513
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 And one of the things that just happened is you were the priesthood of the believers.

514
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 You owned your place.

515
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 You believed that a pastor didn't have to pray for that person,

516
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 that you could pray and pastor that person.

517
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And that is a weapon that God has given us into your hands.

518
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 He has given you a weapon, and it is the weapon of prayer.

519
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 And we don't believe how powerful it is because we don't believe how powerful our God is.

520
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 We don't know that he really is listening.

521
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 But whether you're in your workplace or on the side of the road

522
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 or with a checkout person or with a waiter, you can pray for people.

523
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 You can be this for people.

524
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Doesn't it feel powerful?

525
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 All of you that just got prayed for, is that not the greatest gift?

526
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Such a gift, yes.

527
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 And we get to go give that away anytime.

528
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 So, we're going to move into a time of confession.

529
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 You knew we were going to go there.

530
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 If I didn't get excited, here's why.

531
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Because, T.A., there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

532
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 That is true.

533
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It is true.

534
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 And if it is true, then this is the safest place in the world to say your sin.

535
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 But before we get to that, I actually want to help your view of confession with God to grow a little greater.

536
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Confession means to say what is true.

537
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And sometimes what is true is that you're struggling with addiction.

538
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Sometimes what is true is that you're struggling with sin.

539
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Sometimes what is true is you're struggling with immorality in a relationship.

540
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 But sometimes what is true is you are paralyzed in fear.

541
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And so, I want to begin this little part of confession, I want to begin by praying against fear.

542
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 And by naming your fears.

543
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Each of you is probably afraid of something.

544
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 It may not be obvious to you every day, but it's probably the thing beneath the thing.

545
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 It's something that you're afraid of.

546
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 And so, I want to take just a minute, and I want you to process that with the people you've been praying with.

547
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 And 2 Timothy 1:7 says this, "For God gave us a spirit, not of fear, but of power, of love, and self-control."

548
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 So, if we're going to fight sin, then we have to not be afraid.

549
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 And so, what is it that you're afraid of?

550
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Of course, the thing that the enemy has made you believe is more powerful than God.

551
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 So, with your people right now, I want you to just confess your fear.

552

576
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 Okay.

577
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 I know, y'all are just getting started.

578
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 But I'm not going to miss sin, too, so we're going there.

579
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 And here's how I want to do this.

580
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 So, you've said your fear. Many of you haven't had a chance to pray for it yet.

581
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And here's how we're going to do confession.

582
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 We're going to say it out loud.

583
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 "God, forgive me for blank."

584
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 "God, release me from blank."

585
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Whatever that fear is, say what is true.

586
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 And we're just going to spend some time in the quiet.

587
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And you can stand up and say it loud, or you can stand up and say it quiet.

588
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 I don't care, but I want you to stand up, because there is something powerful about standing up and speaking it.

589
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 [silence]

590
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Alright. Calm down, folks.

591
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Let's go.

592
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 [silence]

593

 How do you work with existence?

 [inaudible]

605
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 You promise, God,

606
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 if we confess our sins to you,

607
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 that you will forgive us our sins.

608
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 And so we believe that.

609
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 And we pray against the enemy who condemns.

610
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 We pray against the enemy who lies.

611
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 We pray against the enemy who issues a spirit of fear.

612
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 God, we want you.

613
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 We want a night like tonight to be our everyday life.

614
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Praying with our friends and running after you and fighting the darkness.

615
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 God, we don't want to exist for our few days here.

616
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 We want to be in the river of your spirit.

617
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 We want to not miss every good work that you have prepared in advance for us to do.

618
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 So, God, would we not bow down to the lies?

619
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Would we not bow down to the condemnation?

620
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 But would you be the lifter of our heads?

621
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Would you lift our heads and remind us what is true?

622
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 You have us.

623
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 You love us.

624
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 You like us.

625
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 And we can come to you with anything and everything.

626
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 Every word that was spoken,

627
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 God, in confession, quiet or loud.

628
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 God, I pray that you would bring comfort and peace.

629
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 I pray that there would be no shame,

630
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 that there would be no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

631
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 And for those who have not yet met Christ Jesus,

632
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 would this be the moment?

633
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Would this be the moment where they realize

634
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 a broken people can come to God in their brokenness?

635
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 God, I pray for the person right now

636
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 that knows that they don't know you.

637
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 God, I pray that this would be the minute

638
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 that they would just simply pray these words,

639
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 because this is all we do,

640
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 is to put our faith and hope in you.

641
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 Jesus, I need you.

642
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 I believe that you are the son of God.

643
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 I believe that these sins that I've been so afraid

644
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 to say out loud, God, that you knew them already.

645
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 And that you have the power to forgive them

646
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 because of the blood of Jesus.

647
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 So would you come into my life and I will serve you.

648
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 I will follow you.

649
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Help me do that.

650
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 And our God who conquered death

651
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 has the power for sure to conquer sin.

652
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Yes, it is good.

653
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 It is good.

654
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 (congregation applauding)

655
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 And so we're gonna pray for the world

656
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 and for the people that don't know him yet.

657
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 - Yeah.

658
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 So the last thing we wanna pray is,

659
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 I wanna invite you to just think about the people

660
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 in your spheres of influence

661
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 who do not have a relationship with Jesus Christ.

662
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 They might be here with you tonight.

663
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 I was thinking about a woman in scripture, Lydia,

664
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 and here's what it says about her.

665
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 It says, "The Lord opened her heart

666
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 "to pay attention to what was said by Paul."

667
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 And so I just want you to think,

668
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 is there someone in your life,

669
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 maybe it's a family member, maybe it's a friend,

670
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 maybe it's a co-worker,

671
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 maybe it's someone that you work out with

672
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 or someone that you live next to in your apartment complex,

673
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 and something in your heart is burdened

674
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 for them to know Jesus Christ.

675
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 And it is your deep desire for God to do in their life

676
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 what he did with Lydia,

677
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 that he would open their heart

678
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 to pay attention to the good news that Jenny just shared,

679
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 that Jesus Christ died.

680
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 Why did he die?

681
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 Because we needed a savior,

682
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 that every single one of us is sinful,

683
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 that we've all turned and gone our own way,

684
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 that no one has lived the life that God has required,

685
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 and because of that, we all deserve punishment,

686
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 separation from God.

687
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 And yet Jesus Christ died in our place.

688
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 He was punished so that we wouldn't have to be.

689
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 He rose from the dead as a display

690
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 that his payment for our sin was enough.

691
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 So if there's someone in your life that you want that for,

692
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 would you just take a moment and would you pray that?

693
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 You can pray out loud, you can call their name out.

694
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 If they're with you right now, maybe you don't call it out.

695
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 But let's take a moment,

696
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 and I want to invite you to pray specifically

697
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 that God would open up specific people's hearts to the gospel.

698
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 Take a moment, pray out loud for them.

699
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 (gentle music)

700
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 (people whispering)

701
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000

705
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 (gentle music)

706
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 (people whispering)

707
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 (gentle music)

708
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 (people whispering)

709
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 (gentle music)

710
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 (people whispering)

711
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 (gentle music)

712
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 (people whispering)

713
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 (gentle music)

714
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000

715
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000

 (people whispering)

721
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 And as you continue to pray,

722
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 I want you to pray for those around the world

723
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 who have never heard the name of Jesus.

724
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 I think about what Revelation chapter seven says.

725
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 It paints the picture of a day.

726
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 It says this, "After this I looked and behold

727
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 "a great multitude that no one could number

728
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 "from every nation, from all tribes and peoples

729
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 "and languages, standing before the throne

730
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 "and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes,

731
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 "with palm branches in their hands,

732
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 "and crying out with a loud voice,

733
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 "'Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne

734
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 "'and to the Lamb.'"

735
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 And so I want to ask you guys to pray for that.

736
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 Beg God to raise up people to go to those in the world

737
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 who have never heard the name of Jesus.

738
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 Maybe that's you.

739
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 Maybe that is you sitting here in this room

740
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 and something in your heart right now is on fire saying,

741
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 "I'll take the gospel to those who have never heard of Jesus."

742
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 But let's pray right now.

743
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 Pray that God would raise people up and send them out.

744
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 Pray that God would reveal himself

745
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 in miraculous ways tonight in various people groups,

746
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 that there would be revival all around the world.

747
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 Pray for that right now.

748
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 [music]

749
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 [whispering]

750
00:52:44,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 [music]

751
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 [music]

752
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 [music]

753
00:53:43,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 [music]

754
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 And as you continue to pray, I'm going to read you a prayer

755
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 that the apostles prayed in the book of Acts

756
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 when they were enduring persecution for sharing the gospel.

757
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 Here's what was prayed.

758
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 "And now, Lord, look upon their threats

759
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word

760
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal,

761
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 and signs and wonders are performed

762
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 through the name of your holy servant Jesus."

763
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 It says, "And when they had prayed, the place

764
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 in which they were gathered together was shaken,

765
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit

766
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."

767
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 And so, God, my prayer is right now in this place, God.

768
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 You would fill each person who knows you,

769
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 who calls you Savior and Lord.

770
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 I pray that you would fill them with your spirit.

771
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 And I pray that this would be a generation of young adults

772
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 that are filled with boldness, God, that tomorrow,

773
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 when they wake up and they go to their work,

774
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 may they see their workplaces as mission fields,

775
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 as places with people who desperately need to hear the gospel.

776
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 I pray that tomorrow there would be hundreds,

777
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 if not thousands of conversations that are happening

778
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 across the city of Dallas where the name of Jesus

779
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 is being proclaimed, the gospel is being shared.

780
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 And I pray that tomorrow or even tonight

781
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 would be the day of salvation for someone,

782
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 that the gospel would be shared and someone would put their trust in you.

783
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 I thank you, God, for what you're doing in this place.

784
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 I thank you for every individual here.

785
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 I pray that when they leave in just a few minutes,

786
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 God, they would know that you are leaving with them,

787
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 and they can continue the conversation with you

788
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 as they get in the car.

789
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 Lord, I pray that as we seek you in prayer, we would find you.

790
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 And I pray that this summer we would have our best summer yet with you,

791
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 because as we draw near to you, you would draw near to us.

792
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 May we be a people who know the joy of your presence

793
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 and the pleasures forevermore that exist in you, Lord Jesus.

794
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 We need you, we love you, and we sing to you in Jesus' name.

795
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 Amen.
