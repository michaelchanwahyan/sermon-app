[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.160]   How we doing porch?
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.560]   Come on, come on.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.140]   If you're listening anywhere you are,
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.260]   if someone just led you in worship,
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.440]   wherever you are, be it Fort Worth, Houston,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.640]   Cedar Rapids, wherever,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.140]   can we just applaud the way that they use their talents
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.000]   to stir our affections for God?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.580]   Late last week, I was at lunch with two other pastors.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.780]   One was Todd Wagner, senior pastor here,
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.100]   and another pastor friend.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.740]   And we were eating at a restaurant
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.340]   we haven't eaten at before.
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.340]   And so there, we kind of engaged the server, right?
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.500]   Like here's the reality,
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.940]   he doesn't have a chance of not hearing the gospel.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.140]   Like we're gonna talk about Jesus one way or another.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.540]   That's about to happen.
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.460]   And so Todd engages him first and says,
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.940]   "Hey, you know, man, do you mind if I ask you
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.260]   "a couple of questions?"
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.500]   And the guy's out thinking like,
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.340]   "Yeah, sure."
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.780]   Like, "What salad dressing do we have?"
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.420]   Or, "What's the soup of the day?"
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.300]   You know, and he's like, "Let me ask you this.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.160]   "What comes to mind when you think about God?"
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.860]   And there's a host, oh, that kind of question.
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.940]   And so he's like back and forth, you know,
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.260]   between us and other tables.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.220]   And the second question,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.820]   "Hey, what comes to mind when you think about the Bible?"
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.300]   And then he kind of goes back and forth.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.660]   He's like, "Let me think on that."
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.560]   And the third question is,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.420]   "What comes to mind when you think about the church?"
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.020]   And so then kind of all the other tables clear out
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.180]   and we're there 'cause we were meeting
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.020]   about some other things.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.140]   And so we're able to talk with this young man.
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.180]   And I wrote down his questions.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.020]   I'd love to share.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.280]   I wrote down his answers.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.180]   I'd love to share them with you.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.820]   So what comes to your mind when you think about God?
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.340]   He said, "A higher power that no one can know."
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.700]   Maybe you know someone that would say the same thing.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.900]   Maybe you know someone that would respond in a similar way.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.260]   He says, "What comes to mind
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.300]   "when you think about the Bible?"
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.100]   And he said, "A book that's been changed over time."
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.980]   And he likened it to like the telephone game.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.540]   Like when you whisper in someone's ear
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.660]   and then they tell the next person
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.660]   and they tell the next person
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.620]   and then it comes out different.
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.740]   And we got to have a great conversation about that.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.400]   I said, "Hey, are you aware of the Dead Sea Scrolls,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   "the greatest archeological discovery ever to find,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.240]   "ever to be found?
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.340]   "Did you understand that that dates,
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.560]   "pre-dates before they thought the Bible was changed,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.900]   "that it shows that it hasn't been changed?
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.580]   "Do you know how many manuscripts we have?"
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.600]   And we started to have this really thoughtful
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.300]   and engaging conversation.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.540]   And this is what comes to mind
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.140]   when you think about the church.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.300]   And he said, "A group of people
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.220]   "who don't really believe what they say they believe."
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.040]   And I said, "Well, what do you mean by that?"
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.040]   And we're in this conversation.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.880]   He said, "Well, you know,"
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.040]   he's essentially saying people that gather around hypocrisy
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.000]   because they say that Jesus is the life
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.900]   and the Bible is true and that life is found in God alone,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.300]   but they really live their lives however they want.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.920]   And I was particularly intrigued by this answer.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.840]   And I asked him, I said, "Well, listen, what do you believe?"
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.780]   And he said this, he said,
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.020]   "I believe we need to find our own way
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.960]   "determine what is true for us
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.900]   "and live our lives the way we want to
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900]   "as long as we do good."
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.880]   We're in this series, Bad Advice,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.780]   and I wanna start by saying that's bad advice.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.920]   That's bad advice that you need to find your own way to God,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.440]   determine what is true for you
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.560]   and live your life however you want as long as you do good.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.400]   That's not good advice.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.480]   But this is very popular idea,
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.760]   particularly in our generation.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.800]   This is an idea that's growing in popularity,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.720]   and I'll show you some stats that 43% of millennials,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.860]   if you were born between 1980 and 2000,
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.880]   said it doesn't matter what religious faith you follow
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.560]   because they all teach the same lessons.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.240]   Some of you might think that here.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.460]   70% of all major Christian
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.080]   and non-Christian religious groups say
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.000]   many religions can lead to eternal life.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Comes from USA Today.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.760]   The fastest growing religious expression
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.480]   among the millennials is called nuns,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.640]   comprised of men and women who have no religious affiliation
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.200]   or are atheist agnostic.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320]   They might say, "I'm spiritual but not religious."
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.160]   You ever heard this?
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.980]   Anybody ever told you that?
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.880]   "Hey, I'm spiritual but not religious."
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.720]   Anybody ever heard that?
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.720]   Some of you here, you've said that.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   Spiritual, not religious.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   Pew Research Center said that this is twice as many,
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.900]   millennials believe this,
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.760]   than compared to our parents' generation,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.780]   and three times more than compared
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.960]   to our grandparents' generation.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.160]   Furthermore, when it comes to religious tolerance,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.720]   millennials tend to think it doesn't matter what you believe.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.060]   68% say there's more than one true way
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.000]   to interpret the teachings of my religion.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.720]   50% believe all people are eventually saved
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.160]   or accepted by God no matter what they do.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.320]   That is a teaching called universalism.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.580]   That everyone ultimately goes to heaven,
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.300]   and here's the problem with those beliefs.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.760]   They're not rooted in an ancient scripture,
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.120]   an ancient writing, a man who showed back up from the dead
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.320]   and say, "Here's the reality."
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   They're not rooted in history, biology, and science.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.840]   They're rooted in one thing, feelings.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.040]   I don't wanna think people go to hell,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.160]   so I kinda just made up my own religion
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.060]   that all people somehow get to heaven.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.760]   That's interesting.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.520]   What divine revelation did you have?
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.680]   What dream, what man showed back up from the grave
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.780]   and taught you?
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.960]   It's just a convenient truth.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.880]   We think we're growing smarter than our parents
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.860]   and than our grandparents,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.120]   but really, when it comes to God, we digress.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.720]   If there's a God, and he's a creator God,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.400]   and I literally believe this as fact.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.580]   I believe he spoke things into existence,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.140]   like he said it and it formed.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.520]   That he's the creator of all things,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.940]   that he thought about you before the creation of the world
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.600]   and had plans for your life.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.260]   He knew the talents he was gonna entrust to you,
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.300]   and so if that is true of him,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.260]   if he can speak things into existence,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.140]   but he cannot introduce himself to me,
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.360]   then he's a weak God.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.540]   And if he has to show himself as these different faces,
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.080]   like he's one God over here and a different God over here
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.620]   and a different God over here, that's just confusing.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.000]   Like you would agree if I said, hey, I'm really strong
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.980]   and I'm really talented and I can do all things,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.060]   but I can't even tell you who I am.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.040]   That's problematic.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.540]   And I don't think that's true about God.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.280]   The problem is that so many of us say we know this God,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.720]   but we live our lives however we want to,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.240]   and our theology gets squishy,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.520]   because we say that we believe the Bible is true
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.500]   and that it's God's written word, but we don't read it,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.740]   we don't study it, we don't apply it to our lives.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.660]   We say that life is found in Christ alone,
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.080]   but if anybody was to come and audit our life
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.980]   and to list out our priorities,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.280]   they would begin to prioritize other things over Jesus.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.280]   And our behavior always follows our belief.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.940]   So what do we really believe?
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.920]   You have a choice.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.300]   You can try to find your own way to God,
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.500]   determine your own truth, and live your own life,
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.280]   or you can turn to the one who gave you life
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.220]   and has a purpose for your life,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.740]   and you can ask him the way.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.680]   You can allow him to define the truth,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.000]   and you can ask him, hey, how do you want me
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.320]   to live my life, and so that's what we're gonna look at,
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.920]   how Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.200]   What does this mean?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.880]   What does this say about Jesus?
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.200]   And so I'm gonna be in John chapter 14,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.320]   but it actually starts in chapter 13
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.160]   as we continue this series, Bad Advice.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.400]   And so Jesus is talking to his boys,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.100]   and he says, listen, I'm going somewhere,
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.640]   and you cannot come with me.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.160]   But where I'm going, see, he's about to die.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.920]   He's telegraphing what's about to happen.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.240]   He says, but where I'm going, you're gonna come later.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.640]   And Peter, you know, he bows up,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.920]   and he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.160]   I'm gonna go anywhere with you, man,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.920]   ride or die, it's you and me for life.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.360]   We're gonna, I'm not leaving your side, Jesus.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.260]   And Jesus tells him, really, man,
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.700]   before the rooster crows, you're gonna deny me three times.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:03.260]   And so he says, listen, I'm gonna go, I gotta die.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.720]   One of you is gonna betray me.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.640]   Peter, you're gonna disown me.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.560]   And Satan, he's gonna work against all of this.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.440]   And so it's this really tender moment.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.800]   These guys are pretty discouraged.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.040]   You can imagine, they're sitting there,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.220]   and they're just like, what?
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.160]   And he says this, John 14, one.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.220]   Do not let your hearts be troubled, guys.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.840]   Come here, hey, listen, don't let your hearts be troubled.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.040]   You believe in God.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.160]   Believe also in me.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.960]   See, my father's house, it has many rooms.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.880]   If that were not so, would I have told you
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.120]   that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.080]   And if I go to prepare a place for you,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.220]   I will come back and take you to be with me,
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.760]   that you may also be where I am.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.240]   Why does he use this language?
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.360]   This is an incredibly intimate language.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.120]   This is the Hebrew wedding or Hebrew marriage metaphor.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.440]   What would happen is a young Hebrew, young Jewish child
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.120]   would leave his father's home, go into a foreign land,
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.960]   find a bride, return back to his father's house,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.960]   begin to build a room on his father's house,
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.160]   and then at a time and an hour unknown,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.640]   return for his bride to take her home to that room.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.760]   And that's the language Jesus is using here.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.360]   He said, guys, don't you understand?
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.680]   I'm going to build a place for you,
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.340]   and if you weren't gonna live in it, I wouldn't build it,
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.300]   but I'm coming back for you.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.280]   That's the hope you live with today, guys.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.560]   I'm coming back for you.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.160]   You know, he says, you know the place where I am going.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.040]   And Thomas, this is doubting Thomas, or Thomas Didymus,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.200]   Thomas the twin, he speaks up and he says,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.640]   Lord, we don't know where you are going,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.400]   so how can we know the way?
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.200]   And then Jesus, God incarnate, God in the flesh,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.440]   creator God walking the earth, said, spoke these words.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   He said, I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.360]   We could have stopped at I am.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.520]   Those two words.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.920]   We could spend an entire evening on the two words I am,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.160]   because this is God's name for himself.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.360]   And they said, who are you in Exodus?
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.280]   He says, I am who I am.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.960]   Remember Jesus in the garden when they come to arrest him,
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.660]   and they say, hey, are you the Christ?
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.820]   And he says, I am.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.500]   And they fall over like a science fiction movie.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.900]   They just, poof, fall on the ground.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.240]   Powerful words.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.920]   He says, I am.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.720]   And it translates, I and only I am the way,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.200]   the truth, and the life.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.680]   And he says this, no one comes to the Father
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.740]   except through me.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.440]   So what does it mean that Jesus is the way?
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.780]   The bad advice is that there are many ways to God.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.100]   My first point is that Jesus is the only way
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.160]   to eternal life with God.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.960]   Specifically, Jesus is answering,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.600]   hey, how do we get to God?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.920]   How do we get to where you're going?
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.600]   My wife, my family, and I, we're planning a vacation.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.720]   Right now, as we speak, I was on orbits today
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.760]   looking at locations and flights.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.040]   And what I do when I'm planning a vacation
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.760]   is I talk to somebody who's been there.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.580]   Hey, you've been there?
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.960]   Hey, what did you do when you got there?
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.800]   Hey, how did you go?
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.080]   Did you fly, did you drive?
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.120]   What's the best thing?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.180]   What's the best place to stay?
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.680]   Right, when you're going somewhere,
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.480]   you wanna talk to someone who's been there.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   Well, there's one person who's been
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.840]   in eternity past in heaven with the Father,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.920]   came here and is back there, and he's coming back here.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.120]   And this was the opportunity.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.040]   Hey, so how do I get there?
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.660]   Hey, I'm how you get there.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.280]   I'm the way.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.040]   No one gets to the Father except through me.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.560]   And so maybe you've been here and you've heard,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.000]   well, basically, right, all religions teach the same thing.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.560]   That was a part of our conversation at lunch.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.460]   That was one of the things this young man said.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.560]   He says all religions essentially teach the same thing.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   I mean, no offense to him, but I will tell you
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.120]   that it's an incredibly uneducated position
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.980]   that all religions basically teach the same thing.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.680]   Let's just study them for a second.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.180]   I don't expect you to leave here an expert
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.880]   on Islam or Hinduism, but I will just give you
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.420]   just a brief overview from some of these things.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.720]   So this comes from Islam.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   This is the Quran.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   The Quran, for lack of better term, is the Islamic Bible.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.400]   This comes from, let's see, the Ali Imran,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.440]   chapter three, verse 85.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   "Whoever prefers a religion other than Islam,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.200]   "it shall definitely not be accepted from him,
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.440]   "and in the hereafter, he shall be among the losers."
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:48.320]   And then from the Al-Ma'idah, chapter five, verse 72,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.600]   listen to this one.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   "They have certainly disbelieved who say Allah
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.680]   "is the Messiah, the Son of Mary.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.960]   "Allah has forbidden him paradise,
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.320]   "and his refuge is the fire."
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.560]   Let me summarize that for you
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.040]   in case you got lost in that language.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.320]   It's saying anyone who believes Jesus is God
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.480]   is going to hell.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.780]   That's from the Quran.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.040]   So you got the Bible,
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.280]   Jesus, I am the way, the truth, and the life,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.640]   no one is the father except through me,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   and the Quran, anyone who believes Jesus is God
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.080]   is going to hell.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.240]   And they're both right.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:23.040]   They're not, in case somebody clips that sound.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.320]   [congregation laughing]
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320]   Sends it viral.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.400]   Let's talk Hinduism, okay?
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.000]   This is Krishna, the Hindu force of the universe speaking.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.520]   This comes from the Hindu Bible, if you will,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.200]   the Bhagavad Gita.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   This is chapter nine, verses three through four.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.680]   It says, "Those who are without faith in my teaching
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.000]   "cannot attain Krishna or enlightenment.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.400]   "I permeate all the universe in my unmanifest form.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.240]   "All beings exist within me.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.520]   "If you do not accept this view that you do not exist,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.440]   "you will never achieve Hindu salvation."
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.320]   This is the one way to Hindu salvation.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.680]   But it's also interesting that not just the path
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.220]   to eternal life is different, the destiny is different.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.480]   The Hindus believe in reincarnation.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.080]   And so you're not spending eternity with the father,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.640]   you're being made again into,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.120]   depending on how you live your life,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.800]   what your karma was, a rat, a cow.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.740]   And if that sounds disrespectful,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.840]   that also is an uneducated position, 'cause it's not.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.720]   They treat cows like gods.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.560]   And so then there's Buddhism.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   From the Dhammapada, chapter 20, verses 274 through 275.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.700]   Oddly enough, this section of this writings
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.080]   is called the way.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.840]   Buddhism is the only path.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.040]   There is none other for the purification of insight.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.560]   Walking upon this path will make an end of suffering.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.640]   It is the only way.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.480]   Exclusive.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.320]   And then in the Jewish tradition,
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.820]   exclusivity manifests itself in God's chosen people,
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.840]   in which anyone who accepts the teachings
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   of Jewish monotheism is waiting for a messianic world
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.160]   to come, they've rejected Jesus as the Messiah,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.540]   they are waiting for the Messiah to come,
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.600]   and that is the only way to get to God,
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.240]   is through the law.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:25.640]   And so if you're here, and in the name of love and tolerance
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.400]   you wanna coexist and think, hey, all religions are correct,
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.000]   what you've done is maybe the most unloving, unhelpful,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.640]   most hurtful thing you could possibly do.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.760]   What you're really saying is they're all wrong,
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.000]   ignorant to what they actually teach,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   with absolute contradictory statements
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.880]   within their spiritual writings,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.040]   that they cannot be all right,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.760]   to say that they are all correct
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.720]   is to say all of them are wrong.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.440]   It is to reject all of it, it may sound good,
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.440]   feel cute and fuzzy, it just doesn't work out intellectually.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.460]   So now you've got a choice, I can reject them all,
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.040]   I can embrace one of them, what do I do?
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.280]   The reality of it is, is we can coexist here, absolutely.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.720]   I've got friends who are Muslim,
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.800]   I have friends who are Hindu,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.720]   I can sit down and break bread
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.020]   and have conversation and discuss faith,
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.800]   we can coexist here, but we cannot coexist in eternity
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.500]   through embracing those beliefs.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.060]   And it's harmful, it's unloving.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.440]   And if you're here and you believe that,
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.120]   you have made up a religion
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.200]   and ultimately rejected six billion people.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.320]   Let me go one more with you.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.920]   Monica and I, my wife and I,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.960]   we were in New York and we were really far from our hotel
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.200]   and we had done this kind of hop on, hop off bus tour thing
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.280]   and we were really far and we had this idea
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.480]   like let's take the subway back,
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.420]   we'd never been on the subway,
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.900]   so let's experience the subway.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.160]   And so we buy our ticket, we go underground
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.680]   and we're sitting there and, you know,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.520]   should have thought this through,
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.760]   but there's this big map of all these lines
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.540]   and I'm trying to figure out the one to get to our hotel,
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.140]   but there's like a green line, a blue line, a red line,
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.600]   a black line, a yellow line,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.680]   looks like some sort of gospel presentation or something
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.960]   and they're all there.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.040]   And I'm just staring at it hopelessly
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.920]   and I'm like trying to follow
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.120]   and this local, this New Yorker comes up
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.280]   by the grace of God and says,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.880]   hey man, can I help you out?
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.340]   And I'm like, yeah, man, we're trying to get to the Marriott
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.760]   over there, you know, near Times Square
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.720]   and he says, oh man, you need the green line.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:56.680]   Now what I didn't say, dude, don't green line me, bro.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.560]   Coming at me with all your closed mindedness on your line,
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.000]   I'll take it, what about the yellow,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.360]   what if I wanna take the yellow line?
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.040]   What if I wanna get to the Marriott by the yellow line?
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   How about the black line?
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.040]   What if I was gonna jump on the,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.880]   you're gonna come at me and tell me
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.120]   that the only way there is the green line?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.320]   No, I said, thank you.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.840]   Thank you for sharing that truth.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.940]   You've obviously been where I wanna go
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.400]   and you're telling me how to get there.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.700]   That's really helpful.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.180]   Now, imagine that that's what happened,
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.860]   let's step out of that hypothetical situation.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.080]   Let's just say I was dying, I was bit by a snake,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.960]   I needed an antivenom of sorts and I'm there
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.560]   and I need to get to the hospital
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.640]   and I say, hey, and I'm frantically,
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.440]   he sees that I'm frantic and life's not going well right now
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.560]   and I need to go to the hospital.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.160]   Which one's gonna take me to the hospital
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.360]   and to comfort me, to make me feel better,
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.520]   he puts his arm around me and says,
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.840]   hey man, here's the good news,
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.000]   any of these will take you to the hospital.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.040]   Man, are you serious?
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.080]   Yeah, oh dude, that's good news, thank you so much.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.320]   I feel so loved right now and then I get on one
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.620]   and I end up further from the hospital and I die.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.180]   I'm gonna realize that wasn't very loving.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.980]   You think about how many of your friends
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.380]   are gonna get to the end of this race,
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.520]   dude, why didn't you tell me Jesus was the way?
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.460]   Why didn't you tell me?
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.700]   You mean God came here in the form of a man
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.340]   and he told us how to get to God
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.060]   and you kept that to yourself?
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.940]   Why didn't you tell me?
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.580]   I'll go one more with you,
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.960]   if there was another way to save people,
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.040]   see, I've got a son, Weston,
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.120]   and if basically he has to die for your sins
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.040]   or anything else, I'm gonna choose anything else.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.640]   Like it seems like when Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.600]   and he's like, Lord, let this cup pass from me,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.240]   God would be like, yeah, okay, you got it, man,
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.480]   'cause there's some other ways.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.580]   They can just be good.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.640]   You know, yeah, yeah, no worries, no need to die.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.400]   No need to watch my son be publicly humiliated,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.340]   pinned to two pieces of wood in the town square,
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.420]   asphyxiating slowly for the sins of man.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.540]   There's other ways.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.420]   Seems like that's when they would have been introduced.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.460]   And so I know Christianity is exclusive, it is indeed,
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.280]   but I will tell you it is the most inclusive
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.860]   of all exclusive religions
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.200]   because Jesus is standing there at the gate saying,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   hey, come one, come all, I died for you.
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.160]   Just embrace my payment.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.100]   Embrace what I've done for your sins
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.140]   and you can have my kingdom.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.120]   Bad advice number two is to find out what is true for you.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.680]   Truth is relative, truth is different for every person.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.740]   Second point is Jesus is the truth
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.140]   that defines reality in the world he made.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.020]   Jesus is the truth that defines reality
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:57.860]   in the world he made.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.940]   This is different than saying Jesus is true.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.900]   We can believe that Jesus is true.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.700]   Most credible atheists in our day
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:10.700]   would embrace the existence and historicity of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.140]   I'm not saying that Jesus is true,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.240]   I'm saying Jesus is truth.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.940]   But let's just go down that path for a second.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.100]   Jesus is true historically, right?
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.580]   He fits in history.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.980]   He was born in Bethlehem.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.060]   Everyone here, you heard of Bethlehem?
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.460]   Raise your hand if you've heard of Bethlehem,
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.300]   if you're listening,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.420]   raise your hand if you've heard of Bethlehem.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.500]   Okay, it looks like just about everyone's heard of Bethlehem.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.020]   Ever heard of Ephrat?
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.060]   How many of you have heard of Ephrat?
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.400]   It's a city right beside Bethlehem.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.240]   You've never heard of it because Jesus wasn't born there.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.100]   The only reason you know about Bethlehem
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.740]   is because Jesus was born there.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.020]   If Jesus was born in Ephrat, I would say,
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.860]   "Who knows Ephrat?"
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.820]   Everybody would have raised their hand.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.860]   Who knows Bethlehem?
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.100]   No one would have raised their hand.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.940]   Bethlehu?
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.760]   We wouldn't know it.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.100]   We know it because Jesus was born there.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.600]   You know of Nazareth, right?
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.540]   Jesus lived in Nazareth,
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.100]   so we can all raise our hands we know of Nazareth.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.860]   Anyone know Enmah Hill?
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.660]   It's a town right beside Nazareth.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.860]   You've never heard of it.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.940]   See, the only reason we know these places
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.740]   is because the single most polarizing character
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.640]   in the history of history lived there.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.840]   That no matter where you go,
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.400]   people know the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.840]   I've been in the jungles of Africa.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.680]   They know him.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.120]   I've gone down the rivers in the Amazon.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.320]   Six days, got off to find a people
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.640]   who knew about Jesus Christ.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.320]   Not just that, but your iPhone today
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.660]   tells you that it's 2017.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:53.180]   2017 years from what?
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.440]   The birth of this man.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.240]   See, up until he showed up, we were counting backwards.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.560]   Before Christ, he shows up on the scene
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.120]   and we start counting one, two, three,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.080]   all the way up to 2017.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.100]   Every atheist you know acknowledges him
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.900]   by the date they put on their test paper or their checks.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.640]   Truth, that's Jesus is true.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.840]   Truth goes beyond simply being true.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.240]   Truth defines the way things are, right?
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.000]   When something is truth, it can be rejected,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.620]   but it is still true.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.240]   And so there's people who say,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   well, there is no absolute truth.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.200]   Well, then that's not absolute truth.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.560]   Do you see, I just want you to engage your mind.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.800]   That's all I'm trying to get you to do right now.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.280]   I just want you to be thoughtful.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.080]   If someone says, well, there's no absolute truth,
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.840]   they've just made an absolute statement.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.160]   If there's no absolute truth,
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.860]   then you could reject their statement
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.960]   of there not being any absolute truth.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.800]   That's crazy.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.400]   Okay, listen, to hammer this home, right,
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.180]   that just because you say something
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.800]   and even because you believe something
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.040]   does not mean it's true, even if you know it to be true.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.680]   I wanna do something and I need your participation with me.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.180]   If wherever you're at, please participate with me.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.280]   What I'd love for you to do right now is close your eyes.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.760]   Okay, close your eyes, hold your purse close to you.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.880]   I'm gonna watch everyone.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.200]   I'm watching people's movement.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   Okay, if you would just close your eyes for a minute,
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.560]   okay, close your eyes and grab a good pointer finger.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.060]   So hold up a pointer finger
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.080]   like you're doing the number one, right?
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.720]   So wherever you're at, Fort Worth, wherever,
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.620]   hold up a pointer finger and I want you to point
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.200]   on the count of three due north.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.280]   One, two, three.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.840]   Okay, now open your eyes.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.780]   Nice.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.620]   Nice.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.140]   Hey, hey, back with me.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.420]   Now you're arguing, okay?
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.940]   It's not worth arguing over.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.620]   I'd love to, after the service today, after the service,
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.220]   for those of you that pointed straight up,
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.580]   I'd like to see you, okay?
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.080]   That's confusing.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.060]   We're gonna, yeah.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.700]   Here's the deal, north is that way.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.460]   (congregation applauding)
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.940]   Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.420]   'Cause about a fourth of you think you got it right,
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.180]   but north is a really fine line.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.940]   And if you travel it, you'll eventually hit Canada,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.620]   but if you miss by one or two degrees,
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.080]   you can miss Canada altogether.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.940]   It's a very narrow line.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.220]   And some of you, you pointed confidently this way.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.580]   You're like, no, I got this one.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.020]   And you weren't any more right,
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.320]   no matter how much you believed it to be true.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.220]   You weren't right.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.700]   And for those of you that pointed this way or this way,
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.360]   right, you're close, but it wasn't due north.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.740]   It wasn't the way.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.580]   It's not Jesus plus something else.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.920]   Jesus and other things.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.300]   The gospel and works.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.340]   It's Christ, he's the way.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.020]   He's all you got.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.060]   If you wanna get to God, you look to Jesus.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:24.060]   He is the path, but he's not just the way.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.880]   He's the truth.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.620]   And so,
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:35.060]   you can reject truth in a number of different ways, right?
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.540]   I can reject the truth of gravity
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.180]   by jumping off a building, believing that I can fly.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.220]   But the truth of gravity is going to prevail.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.380]   And if we reject the truth of Jesus,
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.060]   we miss more than heaven.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.140]   We miss out life here on earth.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.800]   And the reason why we do, and this is so important,
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.460]   is because you were not just created by Jesus.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.280]   You were created for Jesus.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.060]   This is what Colossians 1 tells us.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.620]   For in him all things were created,
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.980]   things in heaven and on earth,
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.280]   visible and invisible,
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.820]   whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:14.260]   All things have been created through him and for him.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.740]   Here's what that means.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.280]   Your atheist friend who hates Jesus
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.680]   was made by Jesus for Jesus.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.420]   They were made for him.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.740]   And so what happens is we get to this place
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.140]   where we think that us determining our own truth is freeing
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.460]   and it's not freeing.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.180]   It actually robs us of freedom, right?
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.640]   We can choose to be free to do things
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.340]   that doesn't give us freedom.
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.940]   Like I can be free to choose not to eat
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.420]   'cause I want the freedom not to eat.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.100]   I will eventually starve to death.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.140]   You can have the freedom to reject Jesus
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.780]   and you will eventually spiritually starve to death,
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.380]   eternally death.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:59.480]   There are truths that are wrapped up in this world
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.180]   that we must know.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.700]   If we do not know Jesus, our soul will starve.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:11.080]   My little girl was convinced that she could fly.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.620]   She was convinced of it.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.220]   And she spent an entire day building this flight suit.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.140]   It was rather impressive, out of cardboard.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.380]   And the time came to step out in the backyard
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.260]   and she gave herself as much runway.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.020]   This was on Instagram, eternally memorialized.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:32.300]   And she ran as fast as she could toward the fence.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.460]   And I mean, she was convinced.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.420]   And I'm thinking, I wonder what she's gonna do
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.460]   about the power lines right there.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.940]   If she's even thinking that far ahead.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.220]   But she just ran.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.140]   And I mean, I had to intervene at some point
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.940]   to let her know there was a greater truth
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.500]   than what she believed with all her heart.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.460]   And friends, listen, you are believing some things
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.780]   out of convenience and out of feelings
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.880]   that are not grounded in truth.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.100]   And I just want you to think.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.020]   I just want you to reconsider what is real.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.780]   The world, your peers, your friends,
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.540]   it says freedom comes from you determining what is true.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.660]   But this is different than what Jesus said.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.340]   Jesus said, find out what is actually true
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.100]   and then you will be free.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.140]   John 8, 32, then you will know the truth
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.780]   and the truth will set you free.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.740]   Let me go one more illustration with you.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.700]   Try to explain what I mean by this.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.940]   My kids love pets.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.140]   They have, since they could speak,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.900]   they've wanted a pet, they love animals,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.900]   they've wanted a pet.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.420]   And man, they're conspiring against me.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.660]   Like they meet in the rooms to talk about it
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.580]   and try to figure out how they're gonna get dad on board.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.260]   And whenever we get near Petco,
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.860]   like they make me go inside
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.220]   'cause sometimes they have kittens and puppies in there
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.900]   and it's all a big setup.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.740]   They teach 'em how to sit there and look sad.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.580]   You know they do.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.580]   And so we went in the other day, this happened again.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:13.260]   We go in and the girls are looking at the cats
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.580]   and Weston's looking at the dog
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.340]   and I'm like, okay, sooner or later
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.380]   I'm gonna lose this battle.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.180]   And so here's the compromise.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.620]   I grab 'em, I say, hey guys, let me show you.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.740]   So here's a pet I think you might
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.100]   actually be able to get one day.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.100]   And I take 'em to the Betta fish.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.540]   I'm like, look how beautiful this specimen is.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.580]   I mean, it's purple, it's your favorite color.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.060]   Look at 'em, I mean, that's great.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.900]   And one of 'em, the younger one, says,
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.740]   oh, that's fantastic.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.660]   I could take 'em out and play with 'em.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.940]   And I'm trying to explain, no, you can't.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.220]   Like the fish has to be in water.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.360]   He's like, no, no, no, that's too confining.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.580]   He didn't say that word.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.260]   But he's like, it's not, he said, it's not fair, daddy.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.900]   It's not fair.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.820]   We'll get 'em out, we'll bust 'em outta here.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.340]   We'll put 'em in our pocket and help 'em escape.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.300]   For him to exist, he has to be in right relationship
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.180]   with that which he was existed for.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.340]   And that's what I'm trying to tell you,
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.760]   is you are made by Jesus for Jesus.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.860]   The truth that you live in
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.520]   is that you have to remain connected to that vine.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.140]   Or you are dying.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:32.140]   You're experiencing a spiritual death.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.380]   And if you have not connected yourself to that vine
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.860]   or trusting in his death and resurrection
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.020]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.060]   you will face an eternal death.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.780]   God made the world and placed us inside a narrative.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.800]   Genesis to Revelation, that narrative is about Jesus.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   The whole book.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.060]   One central character.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.520]   And he's coming back for us.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:02.020]   C.S. Lewis said, "I believe in Jesus
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.600]   "like I believe in the sun.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.400]   "Not that I know it's there, but by it I see all things.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.040]   "Not just that I see the sun,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.900]   "but by the sun I see all things."
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.320]   The last bad advice is don't let anyone tell you
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.280]   how to live your life.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.180]   You do you.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.840]   My third and final point is life as it is intended
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.260]   cannot exist apart from Jesus.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.840]   Life as it is intended cannot exist apart from Jesus.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   Jesus made life.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.160]   He certainly knows best how it is lived.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.560]   He lived it as an example.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.240]   He changed my life, by the way.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.240]   I lived in the world.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.500]   I pursued the things of the world.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.640]   Jesus came in.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.440]   I lived John 10, 10, where he says,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.120]   "I've come so that they may have life
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.400]   "and have it to the fullest,
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.060]   "that they would experience life abundantly."
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.060]   And as Jesus calls us to him, he calls us from sin.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.980]   That's repentance, that we would turn from our sin
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.820]   and towards Jesus.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.360]   And sin is not just this bad idea.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.920]   It literally, very literally brings death into our life.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   And this is why the idea of tolerance towards sin
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.260]   is so unbelievably unloving.
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.920]   And this is so popular in our generation,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.560]   that we just wanna let everybody to each his own,
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.800]   do their own thing, you do you, and not intervene,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.000]   and we call it loving.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.480]   It's not loving.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.100]   I don't know how to wake you up and show you
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.700]   that it is extremely unloving.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.420]   It's this opposing message.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.140]   You see, our very best strategy is to call believers
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.420]   and non-believers alike to the truth,
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.720]   into a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.620]   But there's this opposing message that is found
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.700]   that opposes Jesus in 2017 called new tolerance.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.860]   Old tolerance, I have no problem with.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.460]   Old tolerance, it says this, I wrote it down.
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.740]   Old tolerance said that we should accept
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.540]   that there are different views.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.580]   Man, I've got no problem sitting beside you
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.780]   and acknowledging you believe something different
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.300]   than what I believe, be it about marriage,
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.460]   be it about sexuality, be it about what freedoms you have,
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:14.260]   be it about who you voted for, I don't care what it is.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.420]   I've got no problem sitting with you
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.420]   and disagreeing with you politely,
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.660]   just saying, man, hey, I respect your opinion,
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.460]   I have a different opinion, we can still be friends,
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.700]   I still love you, you need a kidney, I got two,
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.340]   you know, it's all, right, that's fine.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.780]   New tolerance says this,
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.040]   says that we should accept different views.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.980]   That's different.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.980]   That's where when I bump up against someone
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.320]   who disagrees with me, that what I need to do
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.580]   to love them appropriately is embrace their views as my own
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.980]   and to say I believe that too, that's ludicrous.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.180]   How did we get there?
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.860]   That's crazy.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.180]   Old tolerance, hey, it's okay for people to disagree.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:00.220]   New tolerance, the only thing you cannot do is disagree.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.060]   That when you disagree, it's hateful.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.340]   What you must do is be open to everybody's views
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.520]   so that no one really has views and we accessorize our lives
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.860]   with different things that different people believe.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   It's like you hear something that someone believes
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.220]   and you're like, oh, that kind of sounds like a good idea,
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.420]   and you wear it like a hat for a season
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.140]   until you find something else,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.980]   you're like, well, that's kind of good too,
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.480]   and you put it on like a coat.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.980]   Instead of actually sitting down
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.300]   and doing the contemplative work it takes to say
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.940]   with the scriptures, who is God?
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.580]   What does he say is true?
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.740]   What do I actually believe?
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:40.100]   How am I going to live my life because of that?
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:49.260]   And what's gonna happen is that people
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:55.540]   will call for tolerance and that when someone faces
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.340]   the natural consequences of sin,
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.420]   they're going to blame it on intolerance.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.060]   I just read an article about this.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.340]   It was about suicide rates
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.660]   and those who are addicted to pornography.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.860]   And it said that people who were addicted to pornography
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.020]   had a higher depression and suicide rate,
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.220]   and then it said the reason that they thought that they did
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.560]   was because of the intolerant culture around it.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.620]   And because they didn't feel accepted or embraced
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   by their addiction to pornography,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.300]   they became depressed and therefore suicidal.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.820]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.980]   God, the creator of the heavens and the earth told us
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.540]   that when we do those things, we experience death.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.060]   It's not the intolerance that's the problem.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.960]   It's the given into sin that's the problem.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.820]   And so it doesn't take tolerance to love that person.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.260]   It takes truth.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.900]   Don't you see it takes truth?
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.180]   Say, hey, let me show you a better way.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.120]   And so I know that a lot of folks here,
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.300]   you're not Muslim or another world religion,
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.580]   but you're just as wrong.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.700]   Because you say you believe in Jesus,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   but you live your life however you want.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.840]   And you're doing more harm to Christianity than good.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.640]   And you would be better off shaking the Christian label.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:21.140]   You would be better off to stop calling yourself a Christian
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.940]   or to really be better off to listen and say,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.760]   God, are you real?
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.000]   And I wanna give my life to you if you are.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.960]   When we understand that Jesus is the way,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.560]   the truth, and the life, it changes the way we preach.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.780]   It changes the way that we share,
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.080]   just like David's great message last week
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.320]   when we share the gospel.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.120]   I wanna show you an example of Peter and John
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.960]   who had just healed a man, and they're facing death,
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.140]   and all they need to do is deny the resurrection
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.920]   of Jesus Christ so that they can live
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.880]   or escape being incarcerated.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.900]   And they're in front of the Sadducees
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.220]   who deny the resurrection, and this is what they say.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.700]   If there was another way to God,
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.040]   this would be a great time to say it,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.180]   but this is what they say.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.500]   Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them,
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.380]   rulers and elders of the people,
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.180]   if we are being called to account today
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.300]   for an act of kindness shown to a man who was slain
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.720]   and are being asked how he was healed,
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.120]   then know this, you and all the people of Israel,
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.980]   it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.160]   whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead,
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.280]   that this man stands before you healed.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.800]   Jesus is the stone you builders rejected,
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.560]   which has become the cornerstone.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.800]   Salvation is found in no one else,
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.160]   for there is no other name under heaven
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.700]   given to mankind by which we must be saved.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.280]   And that would have been a great time to say,
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.140]   hey, Sadducees, listen, man, listen, just be good,
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.280]   and let us go, and let us live.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.020]   Just live your lives, man, lots of ways that God,
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.700]   that'd be a good time to do that.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.760]   That's not what they said.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.360]   In summary, if a creator exists,
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.960]   do you believe that he could show us the way to him?
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.800]   Do you believe there is absolute truth in how we find it?
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.660]   If God created us, do you think he would tell us
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.180]   where life can be found?
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:20.480]   And Jesus, who had spent eternity past with the Father,
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.940]   said, no one comes to the Father except through me.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:29.060]   To go back to that lunch conversation with a server,
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.460]   I said, hey, let me ask you a question.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.640]   Do you have a faith?
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.140]   He said, no.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:42.980]   I said, are you an atheist or agnostic?
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.740]   He said, yeah, I mean, I guess I'm atheist.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.680]   I said, okay, who do you study, like,
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.760]   in regards to atheism, do you read Hitchens,
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.340]   or Dawkins, or Sam Harris, like, who are you a student of?
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:01.360]   He said something really profound I wanna share with you.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:07.140]   He said, I grew up in the dead church.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.660]   That was education enough.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.940]   I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.260]   He said, I've lived my life long enough
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.600]   to know that there are Christians
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.940]   who say they believe one thing,
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.080]   but live a very different way.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.680]   And I'm just gonna go ahead and just claim
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.760]   that I'm an atheist because they're functional atheists.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.660]   It doesn't mean that they actually believe there's a God
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.380]   because they say they believe there's a God.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.860]   Our behavior always follows our belief.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.400]   We can say Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.880]   and then we can follow a different way,
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.120]   search for a different truth,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.200]   and find life on our own in other things.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.580]   You've got a lot of options.
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.800]   If you wanna know where life is found,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.100]   like, you could talk to your buddies.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.360]   Hey, what do y'all believe?
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.560]   You know, you can go to your friends, your parents.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.300]   You can talk to your crazy uncle.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.440]   Hey, man, like, where is life really found?
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.400]   You know, can you help me out?
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.220]   What's true, and how do I find out what's true?
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.120]   Or you can go to the one who showed up on the scene
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.100]   and made quite the big splash.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.520]   He lived a perfect life.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.500]   I mean, people couldn't bring anything against him.
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.600]   In fact, everywhere he went,
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.400]   people were getting healed left and right.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.280]   It's documented really, really well in history.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:32.840]   Such a perfect life that those who were religious
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.300]   at the time became incredibly jealous of him
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.540]   because he claimed to be God.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.820]   And so they tortured him and killed him
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.500]   in the most humiliating kind of way,
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.400]   as had been prophesied for hundreds of years.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.680]   In fact, hundreds of years, 400 years
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.260]   before Jesus shows up on the scene,
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.380]   it says that he's going to die on a cross
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.320]   before anyone had ever seen a cross
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.820]   or even knew what one was.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.560]   He does so.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.960]   And as the prophets had foretold,
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.700]   he showed back up from the dead.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.920]   And it says in historical documents
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.240]   that over 500 people saw him.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.560]   If you're wondering how Jesus became so famous,
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.600]   500 people saw a dead man walking.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.220]   That's something you talk about.
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:30.460]   And these 11 guys who were complete and total cowards
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.080]   now are standing in front of the Sadducees
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.740]   and the Sanhedrin and religious people in the world
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.920]   saying, "Hey, I'll give my life.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.420]   "I saw that man come back to life.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.580]   "You do whatever you want to with me.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.620]   "You want to cut off my head?
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:42.620]   "You want to hit me with a club?
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.940]   "You want to throw me off that building?
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.740]   "You want to crucify me upside down?
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.760]   "Do what you gotta do."
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.840]   But I saw him come back to life.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.840]   I saw him resurrect.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.440]   I saw him ascend into the sky,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.840]   seated at the right hand of God, the creator.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.960]   What you gonna do to me?
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.760]   He came back from the grave.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.360]   What you gonna do to me?
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:09.120]   Better question, what are you gonna do with your life?
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.080]   What's true?
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.080]   How do you get to God?
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.640]   Have you thought about it?
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:27.800]   Father, help us think about it.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.300]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:39.280]   When we're searching for the way to you,
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.720]   we can listen to somebody else
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.080]   or we can listen to your son who you sent here.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.120]   When we're searching for what is true,
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.280]   we can look at bumper stickers
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.220]   or we can listen to your son who you sent here.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.760]   When we're searching for how to live our life,
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.160]   we can read some self-help books, God.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.040]   Or we can turn to you who gave us life,
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.100]   the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.860]   We can ask you what to do.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.860]   Father, would you guide and lead us?
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.840]   Would you direct our steps?
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.760]   If there's somebody here that hasn't come
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   into a relationship with you,
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.240]   anyone listening who hasn't come
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.860]   into a relationship with you, Lord,
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.900]   by the power of your Holy Spirit, please, God,
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.140]   would you woo them into a relationship with you?
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.280]   Help them to deal with these truths,
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.200]   not to listen to bad advice, but to stand on the truth.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.240]   Your son, Jesus Christ, is the way, the only way,
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:42.480]   the truth, the only truth, and the life as it is intended.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.040]   In his name, amen.
