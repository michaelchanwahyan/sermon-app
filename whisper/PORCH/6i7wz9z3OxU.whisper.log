[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.620]   - All right, well hey, welcome everybody in the room,
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.860]   everybody tuning in online.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.000]   At all of the Ports Live locations,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.540]   we are kicking off a brand new series tonight
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.860]   that we are so excited about and praying God uses
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.580]   to address a really big need in this era,
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.340]   and that is on mental health and anxiety.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.520]   And so for the next handful of weeks,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.620]   we're gonna walk through what God's word has to say.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.460]   But let me start with a story
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.940]   that'll give us some tracks for where we're going.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.540]   A couple of years ago, I was speaking at College Station
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540]   at a ministry called Breakaway, which is an amazing ministry.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.020]   And I had committed to speak,
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.900]   and that's on a Tuesday night at 9 p.m.,
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.320]   three and a half hours away, if you're not from Texas.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740]   And the problem was I had also committed to speak
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820]   the next morning in Dallas, Texas at 8.30 a.m.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180]   Now, I realized this and began assuming,
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.500]   oh, I'll just drive back late
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.020]   after Breakaway gets done at like midnight.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.900]   And then I did the math and realized
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.020]   I wouldn't get to bed till 3.30 or 4.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.940]   Now, I don't know about you,
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.420]   there's people that can run without sleep.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.620]   I'm not one of those people.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.380]   I like a good seven, eight hours a night.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.220]   And if I get any less than that,
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.020]   if I'm gonna speak in front of crowds,
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.820]   it's hard for me to put sentences together.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.660]   And so I am seeing just, oh, this is not a good plan.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.940]   And so I am running through, should I cancel one of them?
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.100]   What should I do?
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.580]   And then it hits me.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.920]   A friend of mine, a couple of friends of mine,
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.540]   had recently started a private plane business
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.780]   where they charted out private flights.
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.900]   And this is not really my world, not really my thing,
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.000]   but I picked up the phone, you know, shoot your shot.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.220]   And I was like, hey, if I was gonna use that plane,
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.580]   what would it cost or how much would it charge?
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.860]   And I actually knew the pilot too.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.980]   And he said, if you cover the price of jet fuel,
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.220]   you can use it.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.800]   And so I got some of my friends together in my community
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.700]   and they joined and we just divided and conquered
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.560]   or divided the costs.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.580]   And so, man, everything problem solved.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.100]   We would fly in that night and then fly back out.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.300]   Like we were, you know, rock stars in Coldplay or something.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.300]   And the day came, got to the airport, got on the plane,
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.580]   everything was going fine.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.300]   And then we took off.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300]   And I quickly realized a few things
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.780]   that I hadn't anticipated.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.800]   This was not Air Force One by any means.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.980]   There was a reason why he was like, just cover the fuel.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.820]   It was like a plane from the late 70s or the 80s.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.720]   It was tiny, it was cramped.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.860]   And that becomes really important,
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.100]   the size or a very small two propeller plane,
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.160]   because it was also dense fog and storming outside.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.320]   And so I couldn't see anything around me.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.860]   You're looking outside of the passenger window
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.820]   and it storms everywhere.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.520]   And if all of that wasn't bad enough, I also knew the pilot.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.260]   Now, here's why that's a problem
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.000]   you probably have never thought about.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.780]   There are certain professions that when they interact
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.000]   with your life, ignorance really is bliss.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.540]   If you're having heart surgery, you don't want to know,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.860]   you know, the heart surgeon was your fraternity buddy,
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.060]   Frank the Tank, who barely graduated.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.620]   You want to assume he graduated, you know, magna cum laude
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.380]   and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize last year.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.900]   And the pilot is also one of those situations
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.380]   where Mark was his name and he's awesome,
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.340]   but he's also kind of a little crazy.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.620]   And he would always joke about like,
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.900]   man, I don't know what I'm doing up here.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.340]   The first time flying and you're like,
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.700]   okay, it's not a good joke, man.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.180]   There's a lot of storms outside.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.740]   And he, on top of all of that,
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.420]   he had just recently left ministry
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.900]   to go and help run this plane.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.780]   So I'm like, bro, you've been doing this like an hour.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.780]   And he had nine fingers, story for another time.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.540]   But in the moment you're like, oh man,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.300]   but there's at least 10 buttons up there,
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.540]   I know, on this plane.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.320]   And so it's storming and I can feel every up and down
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.700]   as we're flying here with these guys.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.940]   And I'm like, oh man, this is how I go out.
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.740]   I'm going to die at the hands of nine finger Mark
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.100]   and my kids, you just run a worst case scenario
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.260]   when anxiety hits and I'm walking through like,
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260]   who's going to teach my son how to throw the ball?
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.460]   Who's going to walk my daughter down the aisle?
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.860]   And just all of those thoughts internally that,
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.300]   people around you may not even realize,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.940]   but they're just where anxiety has taken over.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.060]   Now, irony of ironies,
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.640]   I was flying to college station to teach on anxiety.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.060]   I'm like, I'm a total hypocrite.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.560]   I'm going to die in this plane.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.660]   But it was one of those moments when anxiety
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.180]   just grabs you, strikes.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.060]   And what do you do in those moments?
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.460]   This is a question that is increasingly important
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.500]   because anxiety, when it strikes in that moment,
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.880]   you and I have a choice,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.740]   not over whether we're going to have anxious thoughts
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.420]   or feelings, but what we do with those.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.820]   And as a society, we are not great
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.180]   when it comes to coping with anxiety.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.220]   In part, because of the enormous rates
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.140]   at which it is impacting so much in so many of our lives
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.700]   and COVID didn't help that.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.720]   In fact, recent studies from the CDC have shown
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   that 63% of young people ages between 18, 30
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.940]   are suffering from significant symptoms
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.380]   of anxiety or depression.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.060]   Nearly a quarter of respondents reported
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.400]   that they had started or increased the abuse of substances,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.660]   including alcohol, marijuana, prescription drugs,
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.400]   to cope with their anxiety.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.900]   In June, 2020, CDC released data that suggests
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.720]   one in four young adults had considered suicide.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.860]   Here's a slide that shows the incredible growth
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.740]   that happened from 2019 and the rates of adults reported
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.060]   with symptoms of anxiety disorder
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.500]   and the impact COVID has had.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.100]   It's just exploded.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.700]   America is by far the most anxious nation on the planet
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.660]   before a pandemic, and it hasn't gotten any worse.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.420]   And in particular, it's only gotten worse
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.240]   among young adults.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.900]   Here's the age breakdown of people
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.700]   that have reported symptoms of anxiety disorders.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.000]   The largest two buckets being 18 to 24,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.360]   and we can safely assume the 25 to 49
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   is likely more than 25 to 35 in there.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.800]   And so anxiety is not just a problem,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.980]   it's a problem that's getting increasingly worse.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.000]   And young adulthood is a time in life
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.400]   where there is so much change happening,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.680]   it makes all the sense in the world
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.820]   that you would be anxious.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.940]   What do I mean?
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.940]   Well, prior to this stage in life,
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.100]   everything was pretty clearly mapped out for you,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.720]   if you think about it.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.620]   Like, remember, you're in first grade
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.320]   and the tracks were laid out.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.660]   Where do you go after first?
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.640]   Second grade.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.480]   Where do you go after that?
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.360]   Third.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.520]   Where do you go after middle school?
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.600]   High school.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.320]   There's this clear path and track.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.280]   Where do you go after high school?
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year, senior year.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.880]   And then it's like the tracks run out
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.840]   and ah, free fall, as there isn't a clear,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.680]   what is the next step?
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.380]   And a lot of people don't have wise people in their life
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.220]   to help them know, like,
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.880]   what am I supposed to do with my life?
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.800]   Am I in the right job?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.680]   Am I dating the person that I'm supposed to marry?
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.240]   How am I gonna afford to pay off my student loans?
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.760]   And it becomes this free fall
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.480]   that is a breeding ground for anxiety.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.560]   Makes all the sense in the world.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.620]   Which is why this is one of the most anxious times,
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.640]   or anxious time periods in life.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.500]   And on top of all of that,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.700]   just to validate a little bit more,
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.160]   the average age of marriage in the last 20 or 30 years
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.440]   has gone from around the age of 24 and 23 to 30 and 29.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.080]   Which means most of us are walking through
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.920]   the most anxious time in our life all alone.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.080]   Which further contributes to anxiety.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.500]   And so we're doing this series
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.400]   because we wanna help address such a huge issue.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.560]   And candidly, I think that the church
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.480]   has done a really poor job at handling this subject.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.640]   And here's what I mean.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.080]   Intentionally or unintentionally,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.560]   a lot of people have communicated
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.800]   that what the Bible says and what Christians believe
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.760]   is that when it comes to anxiety, you should just stop.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.360]   If you were to ask the average Christian,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.520]   hey, what do you think the Bible teaches about it?
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.920]   They have either been misinformed
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.880]   or are uninformed what the Bible actually teaches.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.820]   So they assume it's just like,
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.000]   hey, just stop or have more faith.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.960]   Which doesn't help.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.360]   In other words, if saying, hey, stop it,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.520]   actually worked, you would have just stopped.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.360]   It's not helpful.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.880]   It's like telling someone who can't fall asleep
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.840]   or struggling to fall asleep, hey, just fall asleep.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.400]   And you're like, oh, thanks for the advice.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.080]   And the same is true with anxiety.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.160]   And tragically, that idea of the Bible just saying,
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.640]   hey, just stop or just pray,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.320]   fails so largely
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.160]   to communicate what the Bible actually teaches.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.400]   And so I wanna walk through and help connect the dots
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.800]   on some of what the Bible teaches
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.460]   as it relates to fighting anxiety,
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.800]   because here's what's true.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.040]   For Christians, I'm talking to Christians,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.120]   our first line of defense
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.760]   when it comes to battling anxiety, worry, fear,
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.360]   is always God's word.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.040]   That doesn't mean that things like counseling
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.460]   or medication or things outside of that,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.440]   there's no place for it.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.140]   Those are wonderful fields, incredible.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.080]   My wife is a licensed counselor.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.660]   I have personally benefited deeply from counseling.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.500]   But for Christians, it does mean anything in addition
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.620]   to God's word is a supplement, not a replacement.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.220]   The Bible is our first line of defense.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.800]   And I think the church has not taught
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.340]   what the Bible actually teaches,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.600]   which means has not given the first line of defense
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.440]   to followers of Christ.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.340]   So that is the passion around this series
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.180]   and around this book,
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.180]   because God's word is so much more practical and helpful
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.500]   than maybe you have ever realized.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.860]   So tonight we're gonna walk through
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.260]   just one of the teachings,
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.960]   given 2000 years ago, that is so incredibly brilliant,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.540]   given by the son of God when he walked on this planet,
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.020]   talking to a group of people
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:15.020]   who turns out were struggling with anxiety.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.220]   It's been around a long time.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.740]   And Jesus brings up some principles and truths
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.980]   that are so relevant to how we
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.660]   can experience increasing freedom
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.820]   and why everyone in the world is freaking out,
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.340]   but why we don't need to.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.820]   So we're gonna be in Matthew chapter six.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.220]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.000]   These may be verses, if you grew up in church,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.300]   you've heard before and may have never actually heard taught
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.020]   in line with what they're saying.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.220]   And we're gonna look at five truths Jesus gives us.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.540]   But before we go there, I wanna define anxiety biblically,
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.660]   'cause one of the challenges with this topic
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.100]   is people have many associations with words
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.220]   like anxiety, worry, fear,
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.800]   and then you throw in anxiety disorder,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.220]   generalized anxiety disorder,
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.740]   post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.180]   And so how do you group
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.860]   and what does the Bible have to say about all of those?
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.100]   All of those are subjects that we're gonna maybe do a views
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.700]   from the porch on or touch at another time.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.380]   Tonight, I wanna focus specifically
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.960]   on what the Bible says about anxiety,
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.560]   not excluding those other things,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.560]   but I just wanna hone in on what the Bible describes
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.480]   and the terms specifically that it uses
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.380]   when it describes anxiety.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.960]   Because even what I'm about to explain
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   will enlighten maybe some of you to go,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.380]   oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.800]   The word the Bible uses when it says, do not be anxious,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.860]   Philippians chapter four, it says,
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.040]   don't be anxious about anything and everything
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.980]   through prayer and supplication,
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.300]   let your requests be made known to God.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.480]   The same word that is used there
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.280]   is the same word that's used in Matthew chapter six,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.720]   that's used in first Peter chapter five,
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.000]   used in Luke chapter 12.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.480]   It's a Greek word, merim now.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.880]   Now the New Testament is written in Greek.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.800]   This is about to be a little heady,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.840]   try to make it as clear as possible.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.080]   New Testament written in Greek
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.240]   and the word that was translated for do not be anxious
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.520]   is not Paul saying never have an anxious thought.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.720]   The word merim now is synonymous with meditation.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.560]   So Paul is not saying,
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.840]   hey, don't ever have an anxious thought, that's impossible.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.600]   He's saying you can choose not to meditate
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.000]   on fearful, anxious thoughts, that is possible.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.320]   So his definition is meditating on fearful
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.100]   and anxious thoughts, which who would disagree with that?
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.080]   I've been doing this a long time.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.960]   I've never heard the story of somebody coming up
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.800]   saying you don't want to change my life for the better.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.640]   I mean, things were off the rails
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.440]   and I decided every morning I'm gonna wake up
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.820]   and meditate on everything I'm afraid of.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.780]   Everything possibly that could go wrong that day,
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.040]   I'm just gonna rehearse in my mind
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.680]   and an asteroid could destroy the planet
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.600]   and there could be another pandemic
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.420]   and that made my life better.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.560]   Nobody would disagree with that
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.440]   or nobody would say that it's true.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.400]   And that's what Paul is saying.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.480]   That's what the Bible teaches.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.800]   You can choose not to meditate
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.280]   on fearful and anxious thoughts.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.520]   So as we walk through in this series,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.880]   that's the definition the Bible has.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.200]   So Matthew chapter six, we're gonna look at these five
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.160]   things that Jesus lays out for us.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.600]   Verse 25, in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.800]   the most famous sermon he ever preached, he says this.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.760]   what you will eat or what you will drink,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.060]   nor about your body, what you will put on.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.080]   So he brings up what they were anxious about.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.000]   And that day there was no refrigeration.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.280]   Chick-fil-A was not open on Sunday,
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.520]   it wouldn't open any day.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.400]   They didn't have the ability to store
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.920]   and so being anxious over, are we gonna have enough food
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.560]   to make it through the end of the season was a real thing.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.240]   To us, he would say whatever you're anxious about,
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.080]   it would still apply.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.300]   Don't be anxious about whether you'll be single for forever.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.760]   Don't be anxious about whether or not
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.280]   Instagram will come back online.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.620]   Don't be anxious about whether somebody is gonna ding
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.280]   your new car out in the parking lot.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.200]   He's not saying it doesn't matter,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.280]   not saying it doesn't important.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.080]   He's inviting us to a life where you are not marked
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.720]   by dwelling on fearful and anxious thoughts.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.180]   And then he asks a question that I think is so profound.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:13.080]   Isn't life more than food
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.640]   and the body more than clothing?
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.240]   Now let me get to the point and I'll tell you why
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.760]   this is so brilliant, like Jedi Jesus move here.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.560]   The first idea that I wanna highlight from the text
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.820]   is to track down your anxiety.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.640]   Stay with me.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:38.040]   Jesus just asked, is all that life is about food
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.440]   and all that, you know, like a body and your life
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.920]   is all about food and clothing.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.120]   Is that the epitome of all life is equal to?
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.440]   Why do you think Jesus would ask that question?
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.360]   We think about it.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.080]   Well, he's God, so we can assume
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.520]   he's not actually asking 'cause he doesn't know the answer.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.880]   In asking that question, his audience would have been forced
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.120]   to go, yes, life is more than food.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.240]   In other words, if we knew we had enough food
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   to make it for the rest of our life,
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.440]   would that be the epitome of life?
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.500]   No, life is, there's so much more than that.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.960]   I mean, food is important though.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.720]   Yeah, but is life equal food?
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.360]   No, of course not.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.560]   To us, he would say, is life not more
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.840]   than having a good paying job?
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.380]   Is life not more than being married?
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.240]   Which, if you get married, you will discover
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.500]   it is a lot more than just being married.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.440]   Whatever you would be worried about,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.160]   he would say, isn't life more than that?
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.440]   And in doing so, he forces his audience,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.640]   just like he would with us, to put into a bigger perspective
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.760]   the object of the words 'cause they don't know him.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.720]   Of course, life is more than just food.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.520]   And he does what counselors still do today
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.400]   in asking questions to help them more clearly see
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.320]   what they're anxious about.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.960]   If life is about way more than just having enough food,
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.340]   why would you give so much of your life
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.120]   to being anxious about it?
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.380]   Counselors, like I said, today will still do
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.220]   the same thing.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.260]   If you go see him, this is about to be $150 an hour
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.300]   right now for free for you people.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.980]   And you were anxious about, your roommate is getting married
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.420]   and you're not sure who's gonna live with you
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.940]   whenever they move out.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.300]   You're anxious over, man, I don't know anybody
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.500]   to look for a roommate and I'm anxious about that.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.580]   And you were sharing this with the counselor.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.060]   They would do what Jesus did, ask questions
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.700]   and try to deflate some of that power
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.680]   and go, well, what happens if you can't find somebody
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.840]   to live with you after they move out?
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.340]   You go, well, I wouldn't be able to afford rent.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.900]   I'd have to move out.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.200]   What happens if you have to move out?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.240]   Well, I'd have to move back in with my parents.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.360]   What happens if you have to move back in
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.800]   with your parents?
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.840]   I would feel like just a failure and I'd be embarrassed
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.680]   about what other people think 'cause I'm living with my mom
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.600]   and she's changed totally my room
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.520]   and that would be uncomfortable.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.160]   Oh, great, okay, you're anxious.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.800]   About what other people think.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.460]   You think you're anxious just about finding a roommate
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.340]   and when you drill down and track down your anxiety,
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.340]   you're really anxious about what other people think.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.400]   Now, does that make the problem go away?
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.080]   No, but it is the first step in order to fight your anxiety.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.020]   You've got a face, what are you actually anxious about?
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.740]   Let me give you some advice that may seem
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.220]   very unconventional but is a reflection
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.020]   of exactly what Jesus is doing
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.660]   by helping them more clearly see their anxiety.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.220]   Anxiety comes in the form often
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.220]   of asking a specific question.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.320]   What if?
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.380]   It feeds off of what if.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.160]   What if I don't ever get a promotion?
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.140]   What if my mom's cancer treatment doesn't work?
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.220]   What if I am single for forever?
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.600]   What if I did leave my wallet out in the lobby?
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.740]   What if?
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.420]   And it leaves you there and it asks that question
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.500]   but we never answer the question.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.060]   We just hang in that oh my gosh, that would be
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.460]   oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.040]   I wanna encourage you, answer the question.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:52.940]   Is that gonna make it go away?
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.500]   No, we're gonna get to the next step
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.860]   but track down your anxiety.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.040]   What if I'm single for forever?
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.580]   What if?
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.920]   Then what?
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.300]   What if?
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.240]   If I am single or what if the relationship doesn't work out?
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.580]   In other words, I'm suggesting an equation
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.000]   to begin to apply and the third part of the equation
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.240]   I'm gonna give in a second but what if?
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.920]   What if the relationship you're in doesn't work out?
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.620]   Answer it.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.340]   Whatever you're anxious about, answer it.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.100]   What if it doesn't work out?
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.380]   Then I would either marry someone else
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.020]   or maybe not get married.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.900]   What if you don't get married?
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.340]   Then I would be single for forever.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.960]   What if the cancer treatment doesn't work?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:47.140]   Then my mom may pass away and that really sucks.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.960]   And that's true.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.640]   But anxiety feeds off of ignorance
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.600]   and not being willing to face those fears
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.200]   and look them in the eye and see them for what they are
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.920]   because when we do that, we're able to deflate the power
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.160]   by applying what Jesus is about to say next
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.720]   but the equation is what if?
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.620]   Then I would.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.200]   It could be something really small.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.780]   What if your car breaks down
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.320]   and you can't afford to get it fixed?
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.980]   Then I would have to figure out
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.780]   another mode of transportation.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:23.020]   It's silly or maybe even simple as that seems,
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.460]   so few people actually track down
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.020]   and chase down their anxiety
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.780]   and so they hang in this fog of fear
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.700]   rather than isolating and identifying
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.420]   this is exactly what I'm afraid of and facing it
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.540]   which is the first step in order to change it.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.540]   And Jesus brilliantly points out,
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.100]   man, you think life is all about fear.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.840]   Life, you know in your heart, you understand,
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   life is so much more than that.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.160]   Trying to deflate the power of their worries
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.520]   'cause inside of that fog, the anxiety,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.280]   whenever we don't pinpoint it and isolate it,
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.160]   it's so much bigger than it really is
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.680]   or we just kind of loom and never get to the bottom of it.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.080]   It's not just similar to this or similar to this.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.640]   There's a study I read that said
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.200]   that a single glass of water is responsible
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.800]   for seven blocks in a city wide
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.240]   of 100 feet tall fog.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.560]   If you go to New York and you see fog out in the day,
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.360]   a single glass of water gets expanded and stretched
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.400]   and is responsible and can make
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.180]   seven city blocks 100 feet deep.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.960]   In a similar way, this is what anxiety does
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.220]   inside of our minds unless we pinpoint it and isolate it
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.760]   and look at it directly.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   It just stretches it and stretches it and stretches it
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.200]   and that fog of fear gets as big as it can.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.040]   And part of the way that you see it, not as a huge fog,
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.200]   but as a glass of water, which doesn't make it go away,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.800]   it's still there, it just deflates the power,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.040]   is by tracking down your anxiety.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.580]   And then Jesus gives us the most important part
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.440]   of that equation.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.520]   What if, and you're gonna answer it,
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.760]   then I would, and he goes to the most important thing
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.200]   to focus on, but God will.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.360]   What if, then I would, but God will.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.200]   Here's where he goes at.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.600]   Jesus says this, look at the birds of the air.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.640]   So they're outside, birds fly over.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.000]   Jesus said, check out those birds.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.120]   They neither sow nor reap, basically plant
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.560]   and harvest crops, to gather into barns,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.000]   and yet God feeds them.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.640]   Are you not more valuable than a bird?
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.720]   And why are you anxious about clothing?
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.000]   Consider the lilies of the field.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.560]   So he points to some flowers, how they grow.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.120]   They neither toil nor spin.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.600]   Yet I tell you, even Solomon in all of his glory
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.200]   was not dressed like one of these.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.560]   But if God so clothes the grass of the field,
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.360]   which is today alive and tomorrow thrown in the oven,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.880]   will he not much more clothe you?
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   Oh, you of little faith.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.560]   Therefore, this is the punchline, do not be anxious,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.480]   saying what should we eat or what should we drink
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.320]   or what should we wear?
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.100]   For the Gentiles, people who do not know God,
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.640]   your translation may say pagan,
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.580]   seek after all of these things,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.580]   and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.320]   Jesus said, remember, God has promised to provide.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.080]   The second idea we see from the text,
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.120]   tracked on your anxiety, remember God's promises.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.440]   This is huge as it relates to that equation.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.500]   What if, and answer that question.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.160]   Then I would, but God will.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.260]   What if I use my own life?
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.300]   I could find myself meditating on
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.520]   what if my wife gets cancer and she dies,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.600]   and I'm left to raise three kids all by myself?
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.360]   What if?
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.180]   Then I would be so heartbroken.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.240]   What if my wife died?
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.320]   Then I would walk through probably the most painful season
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.480]   I'll ever walk through.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.680]   Then I would have to figure out raising children
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.900]   and childcare and all of that alone.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.900]   But God has promised he will never leave me nor forsake me.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.740]   He will get me through it,
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.180]   and he is near to the brokenhearted.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.340]   What if you lose your job?
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.980]   Then you may have to make some changes in how you spend.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.720]   It may be just even for a season
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.060]   while you look and find another job.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.440]   But God has promised he will provide for you.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.800]   He is enough, and he is a sustainer.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.520]   Not to provide for all of your wants,
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.600]   but promised I will provide for all of your needs.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   Jesus brilliantly brings them back.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.160]   He says, "Man, you're acting like people
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.000]   "who don't have a heavenly father.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.580]   "You have a heavenly father who provides for birds
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.880]   "and lilies and does all of this,
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.640]   "and you don't think he'll provide for you?"
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.660]   He brilliantly points out, remember what God has promised.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.660]   So what if?
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.620]   What if you're single for the rest of your life?
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.320]   Stare it down, man.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.440]   You will find freedom,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.840]   but only through staring it down and saying,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.480]   "Then I would be sad,
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.300]   "and I would feel lonely,
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.900]   "but God has promised I am never alone.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.700]   "He will never leave me nor forsake me.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.640]   "He is nearer to me than the breath I breathe,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.060]   "and he will sustain me.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.180]   "What if?
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.800]   "Then I would, but God will."
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.560]   Here's some of the promises that God has given us.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.660]   As it relates to promises that no matter what we walk
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.940]   through, if that old girlfriend or boyfriend,
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.940]   what if they start dating someone else?
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.580]   Then I would be really sad,
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.200]   and I would be really tempted to go stalk them on Instagram.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:52.220]   But God has another story that he's writing,
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.280]   and if they're not a part of that future
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.680]   in a spouse way with me,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.140]   or they're not gonna be a part of my life,
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.540]   God has promised he will work all things together for good.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.220]   And as you begin to rehearse this,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.680]   you will begin to experience peace,
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.660]   because there's no magic words that you can say
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.580]   that can prevent a boyfriend from dating somebody else,
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.520]   a mom from getting cancer,
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.140]   but we can cling to God will.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.100]   God has promised, and when we do,
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.820]   peace begins to be experienced,
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.900]   'cause peace is beginning to be embraced.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.940]   Some of the promises that God has given us,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.260]   that no matter what we walk through,
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.940]   what if, then I would, but God will be my provider.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.060]   Hebrews chapter 13,
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.100]   but God will still be the cornerstone of my life.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.620]   First Peter chapter two, verse six.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.940]   I think these are up on the screen.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.940]   That God will still protect me.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.260]   Psalm 32, verse seven.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.420]   That no matter what I walk through,
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.540]   God will restore my joy.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.300]   As dark as the season I'm in right now,
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.140]   he has promised, he is a joy restorer.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.380]   No matter what I walk through,
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.100]   God has promised, he offers peace beyond understanding.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.260]   That God has promised that the trial I'm facing,
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.240]   he will use to make me wiser and stronger in my faith
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.620]   as a result of the trial.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.640]   James chapter one.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.740]   That God has promised he will help me in my time of need.
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.660]   Hebrews chapter four.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.100]   That God has promised to draw near to me,
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.380]   and he draws near to those who are brokenhearted.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.660]   What if it happens?
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.140]   Then I would, but God will.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.360]   God has promised to work all things together for good.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.100]   Jesus tells them what he would tell you.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.820]   Remember who your heavenly father is.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.540]   He has promised to provide for your needs.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.380]   He can be trusted.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.700]   John Owen was an old Puritan who had a saying
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.060]   that he said it is irrational for a Christian
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:45.980]   to be anxious because a Christian has said,
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.620]   "God, I trust you with all of eternity."
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.820]   And being anxious is saying,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.400]   "God, I trust you with all of eternity,
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.080]   "just not with Thursday."
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.940]   Now, that doesn't mean that it's not understandable
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.340]   or it's not an experience.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.180]   It just is not a rational, logical thing
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.420]   'cause we as believers know God has promised
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.220]   he will provide for your needs.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.300]   He clearly and most clearly did so on the cross,
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.800]   dying for you, giving his life to provide
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.640]   the ultimate payment for you to spend eternity with God,
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.100]   that he has gone to such great lengths
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.260]   to show I will provide for your needs,
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.400]   and I've already done so for your greatest need
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.960]   by dying in your place.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.860]   As it's been well said,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.080]   Christians do not know what tomorrow holds.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.040]   We're the only ones who know who holds tomorrow.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.120]   Christians, we don't always know
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.760]   what tomorrow's gonna hold,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.120]   but you are the only people on the planet
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.280]   who know the God who holds tomorrow in his hands.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.780]   I was reading this week and this verse came alive
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.080]   like honestly I've never thought about before.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.260]   There's a verse in Isaiah, it's an Old Testament prophet,
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.860]   chapter 26, verse three,
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.920]   and it's a verse that I've always read
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.440]   and felt like that is, oh man, that is so far from me,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.780]   and he says, "You keep in perfect peace.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.140]   "You keep him or her in perfect peace
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:11.100]   "whose mind is stayed, focused, fixed on you
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.740]   "because he trusts you."
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.500]   That's essentially what Jesus is saying.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.600]   Hey, remember who your God is.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   Keep your mind.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.720]   You have a heavenly father who's promised to provide.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.980]   God will come through.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.200]   He will sustain.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.080]   Keep your mind focused there,
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.400]   and you'll experience peace focusing on him,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.400]   who he is, what he's promised,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.100]   and you'll experience peace.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.240]   What if?
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.740]   Then I would, but my God will.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.860]   Jesus asks another question, the third idea,
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.680]   so you have to track down your anxiety,
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.020]   remember God's promises, and then he says this.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.440]   "Can any of you, by worrying,
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.420]   "add a single hour to your life?"
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.640]   Now, I think he's messing with them in this question,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.820]   but that's me, maybe that's just how I read the Bible,
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.220]   where he's asking, hey, let me just take a side note,
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.140]   pause here.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.080]   While we're on the subject, let's just all agree.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.500]   Does worrying add anything beneficial to your life?
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.980]   To which we would all agree, no.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.060]   I mean, you may have never thought about it before,
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.080]   but you worrying about whether or not
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   you're gonna be single for forever
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.360]   does nothing to remove whether or not
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.760]   you're actually gonna be single for forever.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.080]   If anything, it may lower or increase the chances,
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.840]   'cause you're a little bitter to be around.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.220]   And if you worry about whether or not
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.800]   you're gonna have enough money in a bank account to,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.140]   I'm kidding, it was a joke, don't send me the email.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.340]   If you worry about whether or not
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.680]   you're gonna have enough money in the bank account
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.140]   to pay rent, does that do anything beneficial
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.660]   to actually increase the amount in your bank account
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.500]   to pay rent?
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.340]   No.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.460]   And Jesus is pretty brilliant.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.540]   They go, let's just all get on the same page here
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.140]   and understand, I think we can all agree,
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.840]   worrying is useless.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.440]   Understand, worry is useless.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.860]   It's the third idea that we see from the text,
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.520]   that he's saying it doesn't add.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.900]   Let's at least all agree it does nothing beneficial
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.620]   inside of our life.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.900]   In fact, studies have shown by the Mayo Clinic,
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.220]   Charles Mayo said, "Worry affects the circulation,
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.800]   "the heart, the glands, the whole nervous system.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.380]   "Though I have never known a man who died of overwork,
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.900]   "I have known a lot who died of worry."
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.020]   If anything, science would say it takes off of your life.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.780]   And Jesus would say, man, let's at least agree
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.520]   it is not a useful thing.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.820]   I think one of the even flaws in the ways
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.580]   that we think about anxiety and worry
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.440]   and the way we express it is flawed.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.280]   What do I mean?
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.180]   You'll even use terms that are like,
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.260]   man, I just, you know, I struggle with control
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.180]   or I have anxiety and I just, you know,
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.380]   I struggle with control.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.760]   I think that is a statement or sentence
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.340]   that we should take out of our repertoire, if you will.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.220]   Why do I say that?
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.140]   Because you don't struggle with control.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.700]   You've never had control.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.220]   That's like saying I struggle with x-ray vision.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.140]   It's like, no, you have never had x-ray vision
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.180]   and you never will have x-ray vision.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.680]   You have never had control and you never will have control.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.100]   Because control is something that only God has.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.340]   And Jesus is brilliantly just saying,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.180]   let's just all agree, get on the same page,
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.100]   understand worry is useless.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   And then he gives a really practical tip
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.380]   'cause that one didn't feel as practical.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.220]   At least we can all agree, but what do I do?
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.100]   Let's say, remember what God has promised.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.620]   She tracked down your anxiety.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.780]   And then brilliantly, he goes into another practical tip.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.620]   But seek first the kingdom of God
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.860]   and his righteousness
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.100]   and all these things will be added to you.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.740]   This I think is one of the most misunderstood verses
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.080]   as it relates to anxiety.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.940]   What Jesus is saying is the fourth idea from the text,
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.100]   which is seek God's kingdom and surrender yours.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:59.300]   Place as highest priority God's kingdom.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.920]   When it comes to who sits on the throne of your life
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.460]   and whose agenda comes first,
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.060]   let there be no competition, it is God's.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.500]   And embrace God's kingdom or prioritize the same word
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.400]   first in your life.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.900]   God's agenda, God's will, God's reign for you.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.480]   Now, most people read this verse and they think,
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.620]   Jesus is saying, hey, don't worry, go on a mission trip.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.420]   Don't worry, read your Bible.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.220]   Don't worry, tithe.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.260]   None of us are bad things.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.100]   They just way oversimplify and miss the power of this verse.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.740]   What Jesus is saying, I want you to place
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.740]   as first in your life, God's agenda, God's kingdom.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.860]   It's another way, it's the same word for reign
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.340]   or agenda or kingdom above your own, above anyone else's.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.380]   Now, why is that brilliant?
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.860]   Because you know what all of my worries
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.540]   and all of your worries have in common?
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.140]   At the center, they're all about your kingdom.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.060]   Now, you would never put it that way 'cause that's weird
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.100]   and we don't have kingdoms,
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.300]   but they're all about your wants and your desires,
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.340]   which is your agenda.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.900]   Your kingdom.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.500]   In other words, I'd never find myself laying awake
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.940]   at night worried, I mean, emotionally anxious
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.100]   and overwhelmed by like God's agenda
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.300]   and God's desires for the world.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.820]   I've never been unable to fall asleep over,
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.300]   God, there's just so many people in China
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.260]   and I don't know if you have what it takes
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.300]   to save all of them or what are we gonna do?
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.100]   No, but that's God's agenda and God's kingdom.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.560]   I worry about my kingdom, my agenda, my wants,
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   my car, my kids, my life, my house, just like you do.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.900]   At the epicenter of all of those things,
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.380]   it's God's kingdom and he's saying,
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.940]   if you will begin to prioritize and place
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.820]   as first importance in your life and in your heart,
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:45.780]   God's agenda, even when it contradicts yours,
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.060]   you will begin to experience peace.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:53.940]   The idea of kingdom is kind of built on the idea
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.860]   of me not getting what I want.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.340]   That's ultimately why I worry.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.380]   Me not getting or things not going how I want them to go,
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:07.940]   which is so funny because as every person
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.460]   in this room has realized,
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:14.940]   life is not always going to go the way you want it to go.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.660]   And we don't always get the things that we want.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.300]   In other words, it's not possible.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.020]   There's gonna come times where God's will
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.540]   or whatever happens in my life is not the things that I want.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.620]   That's not, it's not possible to get everything
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.860]   that I want all the time.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.140]   And so having everything according to my agenda
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.500]   or my kingdom is not possible, but peace is.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.980]   In other words, you can live life
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.180]   and have not everything go always the way
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.580]   that you want it to and have anxiety,
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:47.060]   or you can not have everything you want and have peace.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.620]   Having everything you want is not possible.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.340]   Peace is, and Jesus is saying,
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.500]   put on the throne God's agenda,
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.420]   God's revealed will, excuse me, for your life.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.620]   Now, what does that mean?
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.740]   There's two ways we know the will of God in scripture.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.580]   There's the Bible, which is his revealed will,
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.740]   basically the commands, instructions that he gives.
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.100]   And then there's the unrevealed will of God.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.380]   What is that?
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.260]   That is God is sovereignly over everything.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.020]   And so everything that happens in my life
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.860]   is something that has come through his hands.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.180]   He is over, and whenever life begins to go,
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.660]   not how I want it to go, in other words,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.620]   whenever God's will unfolds in front of me in my life
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.260]   in a way that I didn't want it to be,
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.260]   I can either choose to say, God, your kingdom,
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.980]   your will comes before mine, I trust you.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.980]   Or I can be anxious, but it won't thwart the will of God.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.620]   But I can choose, God, when those times happen,
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.020]   I choose to trust you, your kingdom comes before my kingdom,
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.260]   your will comes before my will.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:36:00.100]   He brings us back, so to something he said 20 verses earlier,
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.660]   like I mean in the same chapter,
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.080]   I mean like this is like 35 seconds later in the sermon,
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   where in chapter six, verse nine,
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.900]   remember we were on verse 33,
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:18.620]   he brings up the same words, kingdom and will.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.100]   And he says, this is how you should pray.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.260]   Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.820]   which is as holy or amazing as your name.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:30.580]   Your kingdom come, your will be done
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:35.260]   on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.740]   God, your kingdom comes before my kingdom.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.780]   And he said, this is how you should pray,
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.620]   you should go to God, say God,
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.560]   your will comes before my will.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.900]   I want your agenda before my agenda.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.220]   And then 18 verses later, says,
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.380]   prioritize God's kingdom, God's agenda,
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.700]   even when it contradicts yours.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.100]   And when you do, you'll experience peace,
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:00.100]   or you can not embrace God's agenda and experience panic,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.740]   but it's not gonna change the circumstances around you.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.580]   What does this look like?
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.780]   It looks like financially, whenever you don't get the job,
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.980]   you go, God, you pour your heart out.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.980]   So God, you know, desperately I need a job.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.340]   But if that wasn't the career,
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.460]   that wasn't the one that you wanted me to have,
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.820]   I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.460]   Would you please provide a career, a job, a position?
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.560]   And if this isn't your will, I trust you.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.540]   God, you know how desperately
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.340]   I wanted this relationship to work.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:36.160]   And I don't know if I'm ever gonna date again
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.080]   after this person, I don't know if it is gonna work.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.740]   Maybe we're about to break up.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.060]   And God, I really wanted this to work.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.780]   If that's not your will, I trust you.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.500]   And I'm gonna embrace his kingdom.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.940]   I'm gonna seek his kingdom first, surrender mine.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.300]   And when it contradicts, I'm gonna embrace his
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.580]   and I will experience peace.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.820]   He models this himself, Jesus talking about
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.000]   when in the garden of Gethsemane,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.140]   he does this exact thing when he prays.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.860]   And he goes to God hours before he's gonna be crucified.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.020]   And look at what he prays, Mark chapter 14.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.420]   Abba, Father, everything is possible for you.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.700]   Take this cup from me.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.320]   In other words, translation, God, I don't wanna die
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.820]   on a cross and be separated from you.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.080]   Is there another way?
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.260]   Yet not what I will, but what you will.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:39.360]   Your kingdom comes before mine, your will comes before mine.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.380]   And I can either choose to embrace that
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.180]   when life doesn't go the way that I want
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.700]   and say, God, this is not what I would have.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.140]   The cancer treatment isn't working.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.060]   And if something doesn't change, I'm worried.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.620]   We may not have much time left.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:56.260]   So will you please allow it to work?
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.620]   But if that's not your will, I trust you.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:38:59.940]   I'm trying to trust you.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.220]   Your kingdom comes before mine.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.020]   You help me.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.860]   And when you do, you will begin to experience peace.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.740]   Finally, he gives us the final solution.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.420]   It's really important as it relates to anxiety.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.060]   It says this, "Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow,
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:22.440]   "for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:27.220]   "Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.660]   I love it.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.020]   Jesus just said, don't worry about tomorrow.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.780]   Tomorrow's gonna have enough trouble of its own.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.340]   You got enough problems today.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.180]   Focus on that.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.620]   The final idea from this text is take one day at a time.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.700]   Anxiety is one of those things that sometimes preachers
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.740]   or sometimes just people in general can communicate,
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.860]   hey, if you will do enough of these steps,
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.140]   anxiety, you'll never have it again
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.280]   for the rest of your life.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.700]   You'll experience peace.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.660]   You'll never worry, which is just not true.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.660]   Jesus says, hey, you take every day,
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.180]   you focus just on today.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.980]   And the daily battle of anxiety is one
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.140]   that will be present for the rest of your life.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.180]   And it's gonna be, anxiety's gonna be present in our world
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.860]   and fear and worry for the rest of your life.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.940]   But it's control over your peace and over you
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.340]   doesn't have to be present for the rest of your life.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.060]   But it is daily choosing to apply God's word
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.300]   that I'm gonna choose to trust you
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.380]   in a moment by moment basis,
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.140]   in a world where the current is gonna try to push you
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:34.020]   in the direction of anxiety and of worry and of peace.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.340]   And if you're not intentional,
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.580]   you're gonna be moved in that direction.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:41.340]   It's like this, my wife and I, we love going to the beach.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.460]   And so we'll go to the beach and from time to time,
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.020]   we'll go with family or go with extended family.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.860]   And a couple of years ago,
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.180]   we were at the beach with extended family.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.280]   And while we were there, I was out throwing Frisbee
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.220]   in the water with one of my brothers.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.200]   And we're out there in front of our resort
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.040]   and throwing it around maybe 45 minutes.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.620]   And I look up and we are three resorts down
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.620]   from where we were staying.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.080]   What had happened?
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.260]   Well, we didn't ever walk down that way.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.260]   It just did what happens
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.060]   if you've been in the ocean before.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.380]   The current just pushes you.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.100]   The tide and the water just moved you
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.220]   without ever intending to or ever trying to
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.140]   or ever wanting to.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.060]   It just moved you in that direction.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.900]   And so what do you do?
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.420]   Well, you're in the ocean, you just get up, you walk
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.420]   and you move against the tide and against the current
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.220]   to get back to where you want to be.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.320]   This world is broken.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.340]   Jesus even promised in John chapter 16
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.220]   before he left the planet,
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.120]   one of his final prayers that he gave.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:44.420]   He said, "In this world, you will have trouble.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.320]   "You can bet on it.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.220]   "Children die before they ever should.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:54.960]   "People get sick and they leave spouses behind.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.780]   "Relationships don't work.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.780]   "Jobs, pandemics happen."
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.180]   In John chapter 16, verse 33,
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.220]   "But take heart, I have overcome the world."
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.980]   In the same verse, he says,
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.020]   "I have told you these things so that in me
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.900]   "you may have peace."
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.060]   You live in a world that is gonna try to push you
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.140]   like an ocean current where just fear unintentionally
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.260]   and anxiety and worry for the rest of your life
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.100]   are gonna push you.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.780]   But it is possible to move against the current,
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.420]   but it is not a one-time-done fixed thing.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.460]   It is a day-by-day, God, I surrender, I trust you.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.620]   I know you're in control.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.540]   I know that you're for me.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.020]   I remember your promises.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.200]   No matter what valley of the shadow I walk through,
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.260]   you are with me.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.300]   You will comfort me, you will sustain me,
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.460]   and I can trust you.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.300]   And when things get dark, I have the promise
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.180]   that I will spend all of eternity with you,
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.700]   and I'm gonna keep fighting against that current.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.940]   And it is a day-by-day thing.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.060]   And I wish there was an answer,
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.140]   and I wish there was a book that just said,
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.460]   "Hey, just do this one thing,
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.940]   "you'll never be anxious again."
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.100]   That doesn't exist.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.100]   That is a fantasy.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.540]   But it is possible to decide,
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.220]   God, I'm gonna trust you.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.580]   When life is not going how I want it to,
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.640]   I'm gonna trust you.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:13.020]   I'm gonna remember your word, your promises.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.180]   This is why we harbor in community so much around here,
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.460]   because sometimes in those moments
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.740]   where I'm overwhelmed with anxiety,
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.860]   I need people in my life that remind me,
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.140]   this is what's true.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.820]   This is who God says you are.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.520]   This is who God is.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.120]   To help me push against that current,
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.920]   to walk and move in the direction of peace.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.880]   And when I do, I move against the current of anxiety,
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.360]   and experience a peace, not of this world,
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.120]   but of God.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.720]   If you're in the room and you've never had a moment
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.020]   where you trusted in Jesus,
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.240]   you experiencing freedom from anxiety
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.280]   is really not possible,
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.640]   because you should have a level of anxiety,
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.960]   because you are gonna stand before God,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.660]   who is perfect, holy.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:05.360]   And it was said abundantly clear in the scriptures,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.080]   there is no one who is worthy
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.600]   to spend all of eternity with me,
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.180]   based on how they behave,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.300]   but what they believe.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.000]   In other words, it is not whosoever behaves
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.120]   shall not perish, have eternal life.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.440]   It is whosoever believes in what Jesus did on the cross
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.800]   shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.640]   And you should be anxious if you've never trusted in him,
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.960]   because you are headed to spend eternity
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.000]   apart from the God who loved you so much,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.200]   he gave his life for you,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.160]   who doesn't expect you to do something for him.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.800]   He gave his life and did something for you,
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.040]   but you have to receive it and accept it.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.760]   And you will never experience peace,
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.780]   'cause you don't have a relationship
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.280]   with the Prince of Peace, the Bible calls him.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.080]   But for the rest of us,
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.840]   we can choose to trust in the midst of anxiety,
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.700]   to take all of that and track down our anxiety,
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.760]   to remember the promises of God,
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.000]   to understand worry is useless,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.480]   to seek God's kingdom and surrender ours,
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.640]   and to take it one day at a time,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.600]   which spells out trust.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:17.020]   If you are in a place where you could use prayer,
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.160]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.480]   You're walking through and you're anxious,
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.760]   and man, it's all over the room.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.400]   And so if you bring the lights down,
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.720]   and everyone who's here,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.040]   we're just gonna bow heads really quick.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.040]   And if you will raise your hand,
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.380]   I'd love to just pray for you specifically,
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.840]   where it is real,
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.120]   the things that I'm saying, you feel,
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.980]   it hits different,
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.480]   because of where you are right now,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.200]   and you're not alone, God loves you,
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.920]   he is for you, and if that's where you're at,
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.760]   will you just raise a hand?
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.680]   I just wanna pray specifically over you.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.440]   Father, I pray for these friends,
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:58.040]   who my heart breaks at knowing the pain and the fear,
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.120]   the uncertainty, confusion,
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.880]   and I can only imagine how much more your heart,
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.560]   because you know each one of these hands,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.920]   you know each one of the men and women right now,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.220]   walking through what they're walking through,
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.800]   you know every hair on their head,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.960]   you love them far more than any person ever will.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.520]   And so I pray that you would be more near to them,
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.280]   and their awareness of your nearness
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.240]   would be greater than ever before.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.760]   You would be more real in their life,
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.720]   than fear, than anxiety,
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.120]   than worry, than depression,
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.760]   and that you would help them experience peace,
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.720]   on a moment by moment, day by day basis.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.320]   Thank you that you went to the cross,
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.400]   and you gave your life,
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.600]   so that we could experience peace for all of eternity,
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.440]   and walk and experience increasing amounts of it,
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.880]   in this life,
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.800]   would this series be another addition to push,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.680]   and promote that in our hearts.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   We love you,
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.440]   and pray all of this in the name of Jesus, amen.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
