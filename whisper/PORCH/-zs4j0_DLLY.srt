1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,200
 - All right, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,080
 so glad you're tuning in with us.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,040
 Like she said, last week was so amazing

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,040
 getting to be together and gather in person.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,800
 It was also such a tease.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,480
 I know for me, I spoke too soon last week

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,520
 during the announcements,

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,620
 and I am just sick that we did not get

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,600
 to be together this week,

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,920
 but I am trusting that God is good,

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,800
 He is faithful, and I am just thankful

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,440
 that we still get to gather through technology,

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,280
 that we have the opportunity here to still meet together.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,760
 And so wherever you are, thank you for joining us tonight.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,800
 And I know that God still wants to speak to us,

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,480
 even amidst all the crazy.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,020
 And so if you're joining us for the first time,

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,400
 we are in a series called "Seven Deadly Sins,"

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,340
 where we are identifying different sins

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,480
 that a lot of people have said,

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,680
 "Hey, these sins specifically,

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,880
 although all sins are equal,

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,800
 these sins, if you let them have a stronghold

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,020
 or a huge grip in your life, they can ruin you.

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,240
 They are deadly in their nature,

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,620
 and so you have to be on your guard against them."

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,560
 And we've talked about things like anger and pride.

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
 We've talked about self-indulgence

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
 in terms of laziness and gluttony.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,040
 And tonight, we get to talk about the deadly sin of greed.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,320
 And I know for me, by the way, if we haven't met, I'm JD.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,520
 And I know for me, one thing that's true of JD

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,680
 is I don't have a lot of stuff.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,040
 I'm just at that stage of life where I'm 26,

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,940
 and I just don't have, I don't have my own house.

37
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,360
 I've moved a lot in my young 20s,

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,020
 and I for sure don't think that I have a lot of money

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,480
 compared to some.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,880
 And so when I first was given this topic,

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
 I was like, man, greed.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,240
 I mean, I guess I can tap into like something.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,600
 I guess I can hit something.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 But as I learned more and more about what greed looks like,

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 I realized, wow, I am such a greedy person by nature.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,840
 And I think a lot of us will be agreeing with that

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,880
 by the end of tonight.

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,760
 And so let's lean in together

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,120
 and see what God's word has to say about this sin of greed.

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,720
 And so here's one way that I identified

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,960
 what greed has looked like for me.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,460
 There was this thing, because of Corona,

53
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,700
 because of all the effects that it's taken on our economy

54
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,020
 and all the things that it's done to us financially,

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,840
 our government passed something where people got

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
 what's something called a stimulus check.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,520
 I had never heard of a stimulus check.

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,480
 I didn't even know if I would receive a stimulus check.

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
 I was like, all right,

60
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
 am I gonna get some form in the mail?

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,600
 How will I know if I'm gonna get my STEMI?

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,280
 And so I guess one day was checking my bank account

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,880
 like I do every day.

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,120
 And I was like, what?

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,240
 Ta-ching, I saw a deposit that I didn't sign up for.

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,760
 I didn't know how it got there.

67
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,580
 I was like, I guess the IRS from my taxes know my stuff.

68
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,400
 I don't know, but I'm not really asking questions.

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,680
 All I see is I got money that I didn't work for

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,040
 and it felt good.

71
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,520
 And what was my first reaction?

72
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,560
 I was like, man, I'm gonna save this.

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,400
 No, it was like, I'm gonna go out tonight.

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
 Dinner is on me.

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,080
 I'm gonna buy those new pair of Nike's

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,680
 I've been looking at over there.

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,540
 And I just was like, this is time for me

78
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,560
 to get myself something because this was money.

79
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,880
 You know, I know for me, I mean, praise God.

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,140
 I know there's a lot of people

81
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,380
 who really desperately needed that money.

82
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,360
 And I'm so thankful that you were able to be provided for

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,200
 in that way.

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,520
 But for me, luckily, like I've gotten to keep working.

85
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,320
 And so this in my selfish mind

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,120
 just looked like some extra cash.

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,960
 And so what do I do with my extra cash?

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,520
 I spend it on something extra with the extra self that I am.

89
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,760
 And so I get my check.

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,000
 And the first thing I thought was,

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
 what can I do for myself?

92
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,200
 And what it for sure was not,

93
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,040
 is there any way I can use this for others?

94
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,140
 I mean, think about what a Christian,

95
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,080
 like what we claim to be about.

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,300
 You would think that somewhere in there in my heart,

97
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,120
 somewhere inside of me,

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,640
 I would think there are so many people right now

99
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,960
 who don't have a job.

100
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
 JD, you have a job.

101
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
 There are so many people out there who have never had a job.

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,580
 There are homeless people.

103
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,780
 There are sick people.

104
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,800
 There are families in need.

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,120
 And you would have thought maybe, just maybe,

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,920
 I would have thought to help others out with my check.

107
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,640
 But no, my first reaction was to spend it on myself

108
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,000
 because that's what greed does.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
 Greed makes life all about you

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,040
 and it makes it nothing about others.

111
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,420
 But a lot of times we can't really see greed

112
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,080
 because greed, it wears a lot of mask.

113
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,220
 It disguises itself in forms of things like,

114
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,280
 man, I'm being resourceful or hey, I deserve this.

115
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,720
 I've been working really hard or hey,

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,300
 I'm putting that into my savings.

117
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,600
 It's good to save.

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,480
 Or hey, I'm just trying to be a good steward.

119
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,120
 I need this money because one day I have a plan

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,200
 to upgrade for my family.

121
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,440
 We're going to have more kids.

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,660
 And it disguises itself in so many things

123
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,800
 that look good on the outside,

124
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,840
 but on the inside, the motives are all out of whack.

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,960
 And we're doing all of these things,

126
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
 although them in themselves are not bad,

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
 we do them with wrong motives.

128
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,000
 And deep down, we do it for comfortability

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,060
 and we do it for our own desires.

130
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,760
 And I want to tell you this before we get started.

131
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,040
 If you live this life,

132
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,560
 if you live a life where you are convinced

133
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,820
 that you're not greedy, but yet somewhere in there,

134
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,080
 you're motivated by greed,

135
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,380
 you're going to live this way that tells you,

136
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,480
 okay, in this, I'm going to find security and satisfaction,

137
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,620
 but you never will.

138
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,220
 Instead, you're going to find an upbringing of anxiety

139
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,200
 and worry and comparison and discontentment

140
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,160
 and exhaustion from striving to succeed,

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
 to achieve more and more and more.

142
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,100
 And so I think it's important that we expose tonight greed

143
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,300
 for what it really is.

144
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,140
 So that way we don't live a life slave to it.

145
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,080
 And so I'm not going to teach you,

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,020
 I'm going to let God's word teach you.

147
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,160
 And so if you have your Bible,

148
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,300
 let's see what Jesus teaches about this idea of greed.

149
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,260
 As you get your Bible,

150
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,920
 we're going to read a lot of Bible tonight.

151
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,340
 So if wherever you're at in your house,

152
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,740
 if you don't have your Bible,

153
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,020
 go get your Bible,

154
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,020
 grab it and open it up with me to the book of Luke 12.

155
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,380
 And while you turn there, for all my note takers,

156
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,820
 here's what we're going to be covering tonight.

157
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,280
 Tonight we're covering the difference

158
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,940
 between what greed says and what God says.

159
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,780
 Okay?

160
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,540
 The difference between what greed says and what God says.

161
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,460
 So the first thing, the first thing that greed says,

162
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,420
 before we read the text,

163
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,540
 is greed says, everything I have is from me.

164
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,320
 But God says, everything you have is from him.

165
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,260
 Okay?

166
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,160
 Greed says, everything I have is from me or because of me.

167
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,420
 But God says, no, everything you have is because of him.

168
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,820
 So Luke chapter 12, hope you're there.

169
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,620
 Jesus teaches more on this.

170
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
 Here's a little bit of context.

171
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,260
 A great crowd is gathering around Jesus

172
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,020
 and they're asking him all these questions.

173
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,860
 He's starting to be identified as a great teacher.

174
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,540
 And this guy, we don't know who he is.

175
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,700
 He raised his hand and he's like, hey, Jesus, my brother,

176
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,220
 he won't give me my half of our inheritance.

177
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,100
 Can you go tell him, like, dad,

178
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,800
 can you go tell him to like give me half of our share?

179
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,780
 And Jesus looks at him and says,

180
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,300
 dude, I'm not the boss of you or your brother.

181
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,860
 But then he kind of like goes off

182
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,420
 and gives a quick little dad lesson.

183
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,780
 Here's what he says in verse 15.

184
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,780
 Then he said to them, watch out, warning, caution.

185
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,080
 Be on your guard against all kinds of greed.

186
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,720
 Life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.

187
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,920
 And he told them this parable,

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,680
 a parable we talk about them a lot here.

189
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,840
 Luke is filled with parables.

190
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,600
 They're basically just, that's just a way of saying a story

191
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
 that is kind of laced in wisdom

192
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,040
 and deeper insight for us to take away.

193
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,240
 He says this parable,

194
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
 the ground of a certain rich man

195
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,960
 yielded an abundant harvest.

196
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,400
 He thought to himself, what shall I do?

197
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
 I have no place to store my crops.

198
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,840
 And then he said, this is what I'll do.

199
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,920
 I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones.

200
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,240
 And there I will store my surplus grain.

201
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
 And I'll say to myself,

202
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,600
 you have plenty of grain laid up for many years.

203
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,880
 Take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry.

204
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,960
 Talk about the American dream.

205
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
 But God said to him, verse 20,

206
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,620
 you fool, this very night,

207
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,580
 your life will be demanded from you.

208
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,500
 Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?

209
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,680
 This is how it will be with whoever stores up things

210
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,480
 for themselves, but is not rich toward God.

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
 And so here's what this looks like today.

212
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,240
 Just really quick, like modern day, this story.

213
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,400
 Everyone at one point, hopefully, if you haven't, no shame,

214
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,320
 but if you've moved out of your parents' house,

215
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
 you have built up things for yourself from your childhood

216
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,180
 and you have accumulated a lot of things.

217
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,640
 And then you get to this point

218
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,840
 where you have to now move maybe to college

219
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
 and you have to move into this smaller room,

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
 a dorm that you're sharing with someone else.

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
 And everything you have cannot fit in this small space.

222
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
 And so what do you do?

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
 You give it away to the needy and the poor.

224
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,840
 No, that's not what you do.

225
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,440
 You get your extra stuff and you put it in plastic bins

226
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,900
 and then you put it in like an attic,

227
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,880
 or some people go as far as to purchase

228
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,680
 or rent these things called storage units,

229
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,560
 where they literally pay people to keep their extra stuff

230
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,680
 that they think one day they'll need,

231
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,200
 but in reality, it'll just contain dust

232
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,020
 and they might not ever see it again.

233
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,880
 It's crazy.

234
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
 And it's very normal here in America

235
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,880
 for us to build bigger barns

236
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,960
 like we see here in this guy's story.

237
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,080
 A lot of us though, we don't even store our extra stuff.

238
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,960
 We ain't even trying to hide that we're extra.

239
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,220
 I know for me, I got stuff laying everywhere

240
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,560
 that I don't necessarily need

241
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,020
 and it's a whole lot of extra.

242
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,140
 Things like shoes.

243
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,320
 I love shoes.

244
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
 I have a lot of shoes.

245
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,280
 For some of you ladies,

246
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,040
 you might have a lot of extra purses out there.

247
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,120
 I don't wanna, I know I'm treading on whatever, but clothes.

248
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,600
 I know for me, I have a lot of hoodies.

249
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,520
 I'm a big hoodie guy.

250
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,600
 I don't understand it.

251
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,640
 Money.

252
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,680
 And some of you right now are like, nope, trust me.

253
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,760
 That's the one thing, pal,

254
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,200
 especially right now with Corona,

255
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,160
 I do not have an extra amount of money,

256
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,200
 but then I think Jesus would even lean in and say,

257
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,320
 okay, well then how are you paying for your Spotify premium

258
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,580
 or Apple music?

259
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,240
 How do you have Netflix, Hulu?

260
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,920
 How do you manage to somehow go out to eat all the time

261
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,680
 or go out every weekend?

262
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,040
 That Xbox you got, you have extra money.

263
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,120
 Some of you, it might be extra time.

264
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
 You might say, I'm too busy.

265
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
 I don't have extra time.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I have too much going on.

267
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,600
 And any free time I do get, I need it for me,

268
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,680
 for #selfcare.

269
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,520
 Haven't you ever heard?

270
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,620
 I need to rest.

271
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,520
 And some of us, it might be our emotions.

272
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,000
 Hey, I just only have so many.

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,360
 This is my personality.

274
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,480
 This is the way I am.

275
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,360
 I can't be giving away all these emotions

276
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,320
 that are a lot of work for me.

277
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,080
 And so we protect these things

278
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,720
 and we store these things for ourself.

279
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,020
 And we think that all of the extra that we have,

280
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,940
 it has a place.

281
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,180
 And that place usually doesn't involve other people.

282
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,760
 It involves making our life more comfortable.

283
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,860
 And these things, hear me, in and of themselves,

284
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,900
 music isn't bad.

285
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,780
 Xbox, not bad.

286
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,360
 Netflix, but not bad.

287
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,420
 God has given us things like music.

288
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,700
 God has given us time and emotions,

289
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,080
 but how we steward these things, how we use these things,

290
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,520
 the why behind we have these things,

291
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,180
 says a lot about our relationship with those things.

292
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,160
 It says a lot about where we are at in our heart with greed.

293
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,820
 And I believe if you are so unsure,

294
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,460
 if you don't want to help other people

295
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,600
 and use your things with other people,

296
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,840
 if you protect your time and your space

297
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,160
 and your money and your things,

298
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,600
 and if you're the only one,

299
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,120
 I would say that Jesus would want to share

300
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,140
 this story with you.

301
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,200
 And so I think he still wants to share it with us tonight.

302
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,120
 And so a lot of the reasons, hear this,

303
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,200
 a lot of the reasons why

304
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,160
 we think everything we have is ours.

305
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,840
 The reason why we're so quick to believe that greed,

306
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,880
 when it says that what we own is ours,

307
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,280
 is because we think we did something to get it.

308
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,400
 We think that we earned the things that we have.

309
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,880
 And so it's only natural to think,

310
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,480
 oh, well, if I earned this, if I achieved this thing,

311
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,900
 if I put in the work

312
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,760
 and then I received the benefits from it,

313
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,160
 if I received the results from all of my work

314
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,540
 and my earnings, it's mine.

315
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,480
 I get to dictate what I do with these things

316
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,700
 because they're mine, mine, mine.

317
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,440
 And in verse 16 of the story,

318
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,880
 we see this in this man's life.

319
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,920
 He says, "The ground of a certain rich man

320
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,160
 yielded an abundant harvest.

321
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,320
 He thought to himself, what shall I do?

322
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,680
 I have no place to store my crops."

323
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,120
 That's what greed does.

324
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,680
 Greed keeps you isolated

325
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,040
 and it leaves you to make decisions on your own.

326
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,460
 You don't invite God into your resources.

327
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,920
 You don't invite God into your decisions

328
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,320
 of how you use your things and steward your things.

329
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,040
 He thought to himself, he didn't invite his friends in,

330
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
 he didn't invite, maybe even if he was married,

331
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,200
 he didn't invite his spouse in.

332
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,760
 He thought to himself, what shall I do?

333
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,880
 I have no place to store my crops.

334
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,180
 And I'm reading this and I'm going, my crops?

335
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,480
 What do you mean my crops?

336
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,040
 Everyone knows in this day, if you're reading this,

337
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,320
 if you're hearing this,

338
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,920
 there was no machinery for farmers back in this day.

339
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,320
 Everything that they got,

340
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,800
 their harvest was solely dependent on the ground

341
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,880
 and the ground to have good soil was dependent on what?

342
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,120
 The rain and sun and light.

343
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,760
 And I wanna ask who is in control of those things?

344
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,600
 God.

345
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,480
 God was in control of the ground.

346
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,680
 God was the one in control of his bountiful harvest.

347
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,880
 But greed doesn't let us see things that way.

348
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,320
 Greed doesn't let us see our harvest

349
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,280
 through the lens of God being gracious and giving it to us.

350
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,520
 Greed says, look at what you did.

351
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
 Look at how you earned.

352
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,080
 Look at how you succeeded.

353
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,440
 Look at all of the things that you now get to dictate

354
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,920
 what you do with it because you earned it.

355
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,080
 (silence)

356
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,520
 I know for, I was thinking about this,

357
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,000
 sorry, I was just reading my notes.

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,760
 And it says, remind them of what a toddler is like.

359
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,600
 And I was thinking about how crazy it is

360
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,000
 that sometimes we think that we can look at God and say mine.

361
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,280
 And it's been like this from the very beginning.

362
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,480
 Toddlers, you give them a toy and they start playing with it

363
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,360
 and start figuring it out.

364
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,280
 And they're like, this is nice.

365
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,640
 And then you're like, hey, share with your brother

366
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,480
 or share with so-and-so.

367
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,320
 And they're like, no.

368
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,140
 And they start crying.

369
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,280
 They're like, mine, mine, mine.

370
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,520
 And what's crazy about that is it's not theirs.

371
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,720
 It was given to them by other people who worked

372
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,560
 and got the money and went to the store and bought the toy.

373
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,800
 A toddler cannot do anything for itself.

374
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,240
 It only got the toy because its parents gave it to them.

375
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,920
 And so it's the same with us.

376
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,560
 For us to look at our things

377
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,560
 and to basically communicate to God, mine, I did this.

378
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
 I paid for this.

379
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
 I earned this.

380
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,380
 It's crazy.

381
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,760
 I'm here to remind myself and remind you guys tonight

382
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,720
 that everything we have is from God.

383
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,020
 Nothing is ours.

384
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,020
 Greed will say it's mine, but God says everything is his.

385
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,620
 Greed will say, no, I took the extra four years of college

386
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,800
 to get this doctorate degree.

387
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,200
 Greed will say, no, I put in the work on Saturdays

388
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,560
 when everyone was out partying.

389
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,040
 Greed will say, no, I came out of the hole

390
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,400
 that was my family and came out of my small town

391
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,900
 and am now living the Dallas dream of success.

392
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,440
 No, I put in the workouts and the dieting

393
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,400
 and the discipline to get to where I am today.

394
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,320
 I, I, I.

395
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,280
 And so therefore, because all of this was because of me,

396
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,160
 when I received the benefits from my labor, it's mine.

397
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,080
 And why are we so quick to claim the things that are good?

398
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,680
 Like this guy was like my crops, my harvest.

399
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,320
 If I'm like my promotion, my paycheck, my new shoes.

400
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,240
 But yet the moment that things go bad in our lives,

401
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,980
 the moment that things don't go how we want them to,

402
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,720
 that's when we're like, this one's yours, God.

403
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,800
 Like that's when I realized that I'm quick to put the blame

404
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,760
 and like the power in God's hand.

405
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,280
 When things go bad, when I'm in a wilderness season,

406
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,600
 when I'm in a dry season, when storms come,

407
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,720
 I'm like, God, it's yours, it's yours, take it.

408
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,540
 You're in control.

409
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,880
 I know you're in control, but when life is good,

410
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,960
 when I don't need to depend on God, I'm like, it's mine.

411
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
 I've got it.

412
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,700
 I got myself here.

413
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,760
 But that's crazy 'cause the reality is,

414
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,520
 is nothing has ever been ours to begin with.

415
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,120
 I don't care how bad your life is right now.

416
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,720
 I don't care if you're flourishing and thriving

417
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,440
 and Corona has brought you more work than ever before.

418
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
 All of it is God's.

419
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,760
 And God has always been the provider and sustainer

420
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,880
 of our flourishing, of everything that we have.

421
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,320
 First Corinthians 10, 26 says,

422
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,120
 "The earth is the Lord's and everything in it."

423
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,260
 Everything in it.

424
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,080
 And I know for me, when I started to get puffed up

425
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,360
 with my work ethic, when I started to get puffed up

426
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,280
 with my success or my promotion or my pay raise

427
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,900
 or my gifts or the things that I can do,

428
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,800
 I had to go to the word of God and remind myself

429
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,720
 that pride always comes before the fall.

430
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
 Greed is tricky.

431
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,020
 It tells you, hey, you have to do these things.

432
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,000
 You have to do these things

433
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,060
 so that way you can be comfortable.

434
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,000
 You have to earn.

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,420
 And so I have to go back to the word of God

436
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,620
 and say that it's never been about us earning.

437
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,920
 It's never been about man doing.

438
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,840
 It's always been about God's provision, God's faithfulness.

439
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,840
 And when I read the Bible and I remind myself

440
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,960
 of the stories that the Bible tells,

441
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
 that it's always been God.

442
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,080
 God spoke and the earth was formed.

443
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,560
 It was God who split a sea

444
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,360
 so his people could walk through it.

445
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,880
 And then when they walked through the desert

446
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,560
 after he provided manna from heaven

447
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,700
 and sustained them and fed them.

448
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,160
 It was God who flooded the earth and then refilled it,

449
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,040
 repopulated it and gave man a second chance.

450
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,720
 It was God who sent up a man named Elijah

451
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,240
 in a tornado of fire.

452
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,500
 It was God who defeated an entire army

453
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,440
 with nothing but a jawbone of a donkey.

454
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,280
 Go read it.

455
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,100
 It's in there.

456
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,940
 It's a crazy story.

457
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,240
 It was God who fulfilled prophecies.

458
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,880
 It was God who brought his son to the world

459
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,440
 as a perfect God man

460
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,800
 to pay for the penalty of all the mankind

461
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
 and defeated death.

462
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,740
 It was God who told Peter to walk on water.

463
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,080
 It was God who fed 5,000 plus their families.

464
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160
 It was God who blinded Saul,

465
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,100
 a man known for killing Christians

466
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,540
 and then converted him and made him Paul,

467
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,120
 the leader of the church.

468
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,020
 It was God who gave the blind sight.

469
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,040
 It's God who gave the deaf hearing, the lame walking.

470
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,760
 And it's the same God who is giving everything

471
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
 that we have today.

472
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,560
 It's the same God that has you listening today

473
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,400
 because he wants you to hear it's always been him

474
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,720
 who's provided for you.

475
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,140
 You haven't done anything.

476
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,680
 You've always needed him.

477
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,360
 And so come to him like a child.

478
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,520
 Don't go out and think that you earn something.

479
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,960
 Don't go out and think that everything is yours.

480
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,960
 Life is so much better when you admit that everything is his

481
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,920
 and none of it is yours.

482
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,740
 But greed doesn't want you to believe that.

483
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,720
 Greed wants you to think that you have a part to play.

484
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,480
 Greed wants you to think that life is all about you.

485
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,120
 And when life becomes all about you,

486
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,520
 it becomes less about him.

487
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,280
 And then life at first might seem like it's more enjoyable,

488
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,800
 but it only gets more sad.

489
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,440
 And then if you believe that,

490
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,640
 it'll lead us to our second thing greed says.

491
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,320
 Greed says, trust in yourself,

492
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
 but God says, trust in him.

493
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,000
 Greed says, trust in yourself.

494
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,220
 You've got this.

495
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,660
 But God says, no, trust in me.

496
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,360
 Let's keep reading.

497
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,240
 Jesus, he just keeps telling the story.

498
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,480
 He looks at his disciples now

499
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,920
 after he's shared this parable.

500
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,000
 And he says, "Therefore I tell you,

501
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 do not worry about your life,

502
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
 what you will eat or about your body,

503
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,320
 what you will wear for life is more than food

504
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,920
 and the body more than clothes."

505
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,480
 Verse 24, "Consider the ravens.

506
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,960
 They do not sow or reap.

507
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,400
 They have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them.

508
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,200
 And how much more valuable you are than birds.

509
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,680
 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?

510
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,560
 Since you cannot do this very little thing,

511
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,640
 why do you worry about the rest?

512
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,680
 Consider how the wildflowers grow.

513
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,480
 They do not labor or spin.

514
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,520
 Yet I tell you not even Solomon,

515
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,380
 which was just a king, a character in the Bible,

516
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,680
 who was very wise and very rich.

517
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,880
 Even Solomon in all of his splendor

518
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,100
 was dressed like one of these.

519
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,640
 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field,

520
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,520
 which is here today and tomorrow is thrown under the fire,

521
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,520
 how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith?

522
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,440
 And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink.

523
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,560
 Do not worry about it.

524
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,600
 For the pagan world runs after all these things

525
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,160
 and your father knows that you need them.

526
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,480
 But this is important, but seek his kingdom.

527
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,400
 And these things will be given to you as well.

528
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,680
 Here's the problem of thinking we have to earn our things,

529
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,760
 of thinking that it's up to us to provide for ourselves

530
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,620
 and for our families and for our children,

531
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,520
 to think that it's up to us

532
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,880
 to have a comfortable life and a joy-filled life.

533
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,680
 When we believe that it is up to us

534
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,760
 to fulfill our needs and desires,

535
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,480
 then we send ourselves down a path that has no end.

536
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,680
 It just keeps going

537
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,160
 because we were never created to satisfy ourselves.

538
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,620
 We were never created to give ourselves all that we need.

539
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,020
 God created us in his image and in such a way

540
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,360
 that he would know that we were thirsty.

541
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
 He would know that we were hungry.

542
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,680
 He would know that we would be in need.

543
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,600
 And then he made himself

544
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,640
 where he could give us everything that we need

545
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,680
 and that he could know us better

546
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,220
 than we could even know ourself.

547
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,800
 But if you get on the path of thinking,

548
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,620
 I can provide, I can do, I can earn,

549
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,360
 I can grow my savings account, I can grow my business,

550
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,720
 I can build a bigger barn,

551
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,600
 you're only gonna become more worrisome,

552
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,280
 you're only become more anxious.

553
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,840
 And he says here, you're only gonna continue

554
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,960
 to chase after something that you're never gonna find.

555
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,920
 But somehow we think life is easier

556
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,500
 if we can just work harder.

557
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 We think if I can work harder so I can earn more

558
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 so that way I can feel more secure and have more control,

559
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,280
 then I'm set, I'm good.

560
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,420
 But if we truly have control,

561
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,940
 then why are we so full of worry and doubt?

562
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,440
 Think about that.

563
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,320
 Why?

564
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,640
 Why are, if I have control, if I'm doing so much,

565
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,400
 why am I so fearful?

566
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,020
 And why do I worry?

567
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,560
 And it's because most people think the core issue of greed

568
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,200
 is selfishness or needing more,

569
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,280
 but the actual core issue of greed is fear.

570
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,580
 The core issue of greed is fear.

571
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,360
 Because when you think that you have to earn,

572
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,960
 and when you think that your plan,

573
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,560
 like you have to build a bigger barn to store your things,

574
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,600
 when you don't come to God and ask him

575
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,760
 what he would have for you, you're saying,

576
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,800
 hey, I have to control everything

577
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,440
 because I have to know that I'm gonna have enough,

578
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,920
 which is also communicating that I'm afraid, God,

579
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,200
 that you're not actually who you say you are.

580
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
 I know it says right here in this text

581
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,460
 that God looks at me and is like,

582
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,600
 hey, if he gives the food to the birds

583
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,860
 and if he closed the flowers,

584
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,680
 how much more would he give you the things that you need?

585
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,480
 He knows you, but just seek him.

586
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,520
 He knows you.

587
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,040
 I don't really believe that.

588
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,840
 Or I would just trust him.

589
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,700
 And I would ask him, hey, what do you want me to do?

590
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,820
 What are your plans for my life?

591
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,260
 How do you want me to steward my things?

592
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,840
 And I would take myself out of the equation

593
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,080
 and I would let God lead.

594
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,220
 But we're fearful.

595
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,280
 We're afraid to give up control.

596
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,240
 And I don't know what it is.

597
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,840
 It could be different for every person.

598
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,340
 Something might've happened to you.

599
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,180
 Someone might've abandoned you

600
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,780
 that was supposed to provide for you.

601
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,740
 Someone might've broken your heart

602
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,780
 when they were supposed to bring you

603
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,500
 satisfaction and security.

604
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,820
 Someone might have withheld something from you

605
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,780
 out of maliciousness.

606
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,540
 I don't know what happened to you

607
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,780
 for you to project this onto God.

608
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,320
 But I'm telling you, God does not fail.

609
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,220
 God will not let you down.

610
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,900
 He knows you and your needs more than you could.

611
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,140
 And so all he asked you to do is trust,

612
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,140
 trust in him, not in your things, not in your money.

613
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,420
 We were talking about this earlier,

614
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,480
 how funny it is that,

615
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,420
 did you know that on every piece of money that we have,

616
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,860
 I have here a $1 bill.

617
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,860
 It reads, "In God we trust."

618
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,460
 In God we trust.

619
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,260
 It's as simple as that.

620
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,960
 But if you look around at America, no, we don't.

621
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,460
 We clearly don't trust God

622
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,260
 because we put more trust in this.

623
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,380
 We think that this can bring us something that God can't.

624
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,060
 We say, I need more, I need more, I need more money.

625
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,580
 I need to wear the on-brand stuff.

626
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,660
 I need a better job.

627
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
 I need a bigger promotion.

628
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,540
 I need a bigger house.

629
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,180
 I need more, I need more because God isn't enough.

630
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,020
 That's what greed communicates.

631
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,340
 And it's because deep down,

632
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,260
 we're afraid that God isn't actually good,

633
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,780
 that he isn't actually a father.

634
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,220
 And so that's why greed says, trust yourself.

635
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,520
 Because when you trust yourself, you think you get control,

636
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,460
 but that only leads to fear and worry.

637
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,700
 Trusting God is where true joy and peace is found.

638
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,420
 But if you follow greed,

639
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,620
 and if you think that what you own is yours,

640
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,180
 and if you think that you can trust yourself,

641
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,900
 you're naturally gonna think the third thing that greed says.

642
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,740
 Greed says life is about what you can get,

643
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,460
 but God says life is about what you can give.

644
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,900
 Greed says life is about what you can get,

645
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
 but God says life is about what you can give.

646
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,660
 Luke 12, let's continue reading.

647
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,980
 Let's wrap it up.

648
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,420
 Do not be afraid to trust yourself.

649
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,540
 Do not be afraid, little flock.

650
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,380
 So he's saying, don't be afraid.

651
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:48,220
 For your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom,

652
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,840
 sell your possessions and give to the poor,

653
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,900
 provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out,

654
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,580
 a treasure in heaven that will never fail,

655
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,580
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.

656
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,900
 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

657
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,700
 Why did the guy in the first story that Jesus told

658
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,860
 build a bigger barn?

659
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,260
 Why did he think that was the right mood

660
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,620
 to make with his extra?

661
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,700
 Because he thought I need to store up for myself

662
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,200
 on this earth because this earth is where it's at.

663
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,060
 This earth is gonna bring me joy.

664
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,140
 I'm gonna work hard.

665
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,980
 I'm gonna put stuff into my 401k.

666
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
 I'm gonna build so one day I can work hard

667
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
 and work hard and one hard

668
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,140
 'cause I have this dream one day that I get to retire

669
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,380
 and take this long trip around the world with my wife,

670
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,420
 or I get to one day pay for my kid's college

671
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,060
 and I'm gonna work and work and work and work

672
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,700
 for this idea of this day that is not promised to us.

673
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,140
 Like the man in the first story,

674
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,260
 he did all of this work to save and store all of his stuff.

675
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,100
 And then God looks at him and says, you fool,

676
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,660
 you're gonna die tonight.

677
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,300
 And you can think, you can be disillusioned to think

678
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,180
 that you have control of all these things.

679
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,940
 But one thing that you cannot control

680
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,500
 is the number of your days.

681
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 You just can't.

682
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,280
 God is the only one who knows

683
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,020
 when we are gonna leave this earth.

684
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,640
 And so are you gonna trust in yourself

685
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,740
 and your limited view of life?

686
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,420
 Or are you gonna trust what the book,

687
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,980
 what the Bible is saying

688
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,580
 about how we're supposed to steward our things?

689
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,700
 Because it says here

690
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,300
 that you need to store up things in heaven, not on earth.

691
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,800
 Don't build bigger barns on earth.

692
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,500
 Who's gonna get those things?

693
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,000
 But store up things in heaven.

694
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,580
 How do you store up things in heaven?

695
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,700
 By giving away things on earth.

696
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,500
 The weapon to greed is generosity.

697
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,640
 And so just a simple application that I had to deal with,

698
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,220
 this week is, have you ever tried asking yourself,

699
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,740
 Lord, what do you want me to do with my stuff?

700
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,420
 What do you want me to do with my extra?

701
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,760
 What bigger barns have I built in my life

702
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,820
 that I need to take down and give away?

703
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,220
 Take some inventory, identify your resources

704
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,420
 and ask God what he wants you to do with it.

705
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,940
 And ask yourself, I mean, get honest with yourself tonight.

706
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,380
 Make a list and say,

707
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,040
 if God asked me to get rid of all of this, could I do it?

708
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,900
 Could I give it all away

709
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,520
 and trust that God is who he says he is?

710
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,140
 And I know that would be hard for me,

711
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,800
 especially if I'm following myself

712
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,140
 and if I'm the one in control, because I would fail.

713
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,920
 But if I'm putting all my chips in with God,

714
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,160
 that is where an act of faith like this can take place.

715
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,320
 Life is not about what this man thought.

716
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,980
 Life isn't about your retirement.

717
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,600
 Life isn't about taking it easy

718
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,080
 and eating and drinking and being married

719
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,720
 and getting more so you can do more.

720
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,000
 That is a sad view of life

721
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,240
 if you think that's where life is found.

722
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,540
 Jesus says here that life is nothing, it's a vapor,

723
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,480
 but heaven is everything.

724
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,840
 So if you're going to invest, invest in heaven.

725
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
 And how does he call us to invest in heaven?

726
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,960
 By giving during our time on earth.

727
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,300
 So I'll close with this.

728
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,660
 Talking about investment.

729
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:14,140
 If I could go back to JD at January 1, 2020,

730
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,160
 and I could say to myself,

731
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,940
 hey, hey man, you should invest in Zoom.

732
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,740
 Invest in Zoom and Purell.

733
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,080
 JD, January 1 would be like, what?

734
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,400
 It's like, what is Zoom and why Purell?

735
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
 Like I'm a Germex guy or is that the same thing?

736
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,040
 I don't know.

737
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,200
 But point is, is I would look at myself

738
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,160
 and be like, you're crazy.

739
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,240
 I am not investing in Zoom.

740
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,920
 No one uses Zoom.

741
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,840
 He's like, no, trust me, man.

742
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,600
 You're going to want to invest in Zoom.

743
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,560
 And I'm like, ah, get out of here.

744
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,200
 You don't know what you're talking about.

745
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,880
 And then now, how would I view that conversation?

746
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,640
 I'd be like, ah, I should have listened to future JD.

747
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,480
 I would be making a fortune right now.

748
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,760
 It's crazy that I did not listen to him.

749
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,080
 And in the same way, it's crazy, crazy

750
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,040
 if we live our life listening to greed

751
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,880
 and not listening to God.

752
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,440
 Because God says that everything that we see is his,

753
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,680
 not ours.

754
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,680
 God says that when we trust him,

755
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,480
 we'll experience joy and peace and life.

756
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,200
 And God says, life is not found in what you get,

757
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,080
 but what you give.

758
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
 That's where life is found.

759
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,120
 But it's like, but I'm getting less out of the deal.

760
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,720
 I'm literally losing something.

761
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
 How is that more for me?

762
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,320
 This week, I came across a couple of hundred bucks

763
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
 that I wasn't expecting to get.

764
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,800
 And for me, that's a really big deal.

765
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,960
 I don't get to just like take those things lightly.

766
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,040
 And I was like, wow, I have a couple of hundred bucks.

767
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,720
 And I started to lean towards new shoes.

768
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,680
 And I was like, no, save it, save it.

769
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,400
 And I put it on the table.

770
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
 And for the last couple of days,

771
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,480
 I've been prepping at the same table

772
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,000
 that the $200 was sitting at.

773
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,080
 And I'm writing this and I'm like looking at it.

774
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,560
 And I'm like, I have been writing all of this message

775
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,920
 and not once have I asked God,

776
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
 God, what do you want me to do with that?

777
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,240
 And so I tried it.

778
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,960
 I took him at his word and I was scared

779
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,720
 of what he was gonna say 'cause it was uncomfortable.

780
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,440
 I was like, please don't ask me to give it away.

781
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,380
 Please don't make me give it away.

782
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,400
 And what'd he do?

783
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,720
 I read the scripture and he asked me to give it away.

784
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,320
 Along with some other things.

785
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,440
 One of those things being my time.

786
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,040
 I'm really selfish with my time.

787
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,380
 He asked me to start giving away,

788
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,120
 I talked about it earlier, but my emotions.

789
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,440
 There are certain people that I'm so closed off with

790
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,280
 because I don't trust them.

791
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
 That's just wrong, that's not love.

792
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,400
 And he said, hey, none of these things are yours.

793
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,960
 And I had to ask myself, why is it so hard for me

794
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,000
 to give away something that God says is so small?

795
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,240
 And it's because I forget the biggest thing

796
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,480
 that's been given to me.

797
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,600
 I forget that the biggest act of generosity

798
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,560
 came in the form of a baby born in Bethlehem in a manger.

799
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,400
 God sending his one and only son.

800
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,560
 He wasn't greedy, he was generous

801
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,680
 and he sent him for me and for you.

802
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,240
 And he sent him down to live a perfect life

803
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,080
 and to pay the price that you and I could not pay

804
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,240
 by dying a sinner's death, Philippians says.

805
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,560
 He was equal to man, yet he did not sin.

806
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,560
 And he died a sinner's death on the cross for you and for I.

807
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,560
 So that way we could live a life of joy and peace and trust

808
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,040
 that the father is gonna provide for us

809
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,480
 in ways that we never could provide for ourself.

810
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,120
 In the ways that we were never designed

811
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,440
 to provide for ourselves.

812
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,640
 The father is the answer.

813
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,760
 Our relationship with Jesus is the answer.

814
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,560
 And when I start to remind myself

815
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,760
 that because Jesus was so generous with me,

816
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,200
 I now wanna live my life to be as generous as I can be.

817
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,040
 I wanna live my life the way that he's called me to.

818
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,000
 And I'm sitting here going, God, okay, I'll surrender it.

819
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,720
 If you've called me to give it all,

820
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,960
 then I will give it all.

821
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,760
 If you call me to move to Africa and live in a hut

822
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,400
 and never get married and share the gospel with people,

823
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,240
 I'll do it.

824
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,600
 And that terrifies me because I somehow still believe

825
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,480
 that this earth is end game.

826
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,680
 But my Bible says that this earth is nothing

827
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,400
 compared to what's to come in heaven.

828
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,680
 So when I am fighting greed,

829
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,400
 when I am no longer wanting to be generous, what do I do?

830
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,040
 I remember heaven.

831
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,560
 I remember Jesus.

832
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,760
 I remember the price that he paid.

833
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,120
 And that compels me to put myself aside,

834
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,800
 to put my things aside and to make everything

835
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,240
 about the thing, which is Jesus.

836
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,960
 And it's so crazy.

837
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,480
 This like view that's so upside down for us,

838
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
 especially those in America,

839
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
 where it's like, hey, life is found

840
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,440
 when you give away your life.

841
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,840
 You try it, you take the risk,

842
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,680
 and he does what he says.

843
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,440
 And it may not look like you think,

844
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,400
 but that's the point of following a God

845
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,920
 who knows what we truly need.

846
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,560
 And so just to recap, I'm done.

847
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,320
 I'm done thinking that everything is mine.

848
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,720
 And I'm trusting that everything is God's.

849
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,000
 I'm done thinking that I am enough

850
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,680
 and that I can trust myself.

851
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,320
 I'm gonna start trusting God.

852
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,240
 And I'm done thinking

853
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,840
 that when I somehow get to this plan for my life,

854
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,040
 that when I get enough, it'll satisfy me.

855
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,320
 And I'm gonna start believing

856
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,680
 that true life is found in giving,

857
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,800
 just like Jesus gave himself for me.

858
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,200
 Let's pray.

859
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:37,440
 Father, I understand that

860
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,120
 (sighs)

861
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,840
 I have such a limited view and understanding of who you are.

862
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,120
 I have such a small understanding

863
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,120
 of what you truly want for me on this earth.

864
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:01,200
 But I pray tonight that we would be a people,

865
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,960
 if we are in Christ, that we would trust

866
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,400
 that that is the greatest decision that we can ever make.

867
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,680
 That is the greatest thing that we could ever obtain,

868
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,960
 not because of something that we did,

869
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,840
 but because of all that you've done.

870
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,760
 And if there's someone here tonight who says,

871
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,520
 man, I'm just having a lot of trouble letting go of control.

872
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,880
 I'm afraid.

873
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,600
 I've been testing out the waters of this whole like God thing

874
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,440
 and this Christian thing, and I'm so afraid to dive in

875
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,960
 because what if God withholds from me?

876
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,480
 What if God isn't all who he says he is?

877
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,280
 I pray tonight that you would reveal yourself to them,

878
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,840
 that they would open up your word and read the scripture

879
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,080
 and see that it is not a lie.

880
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,000
 It is true.

881
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,280
 It is trustworthy, and it is for them.

882
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,480
 No matter what they've done,

883
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,000
 no matter what they've gone through, it is for them.

884
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,880
 You are for them.

885
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,840
 You are a gracious father who loves to provide

886
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,280
 for his children who just open up their hands

887
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,720
 and say, I trust you.

888
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,760
 And so that's what we do in this time.

889
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,600
 We respond with opening up our hands all across the country,

890
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,840
 all across the world.

891
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,280
 We are a people who are coming,

892
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,600
 opening up our hands right now and saying,

893
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,120
 I relinquish my rights.

894
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,520
 I relinquish my things.

895
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,000
 I relinquish my control.

896
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,680
 And I trust you, the God who has always been

897
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,080
 and will always be in control.

898
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,760
 Let's respond to that and agree to that in worship.

899
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,340
 (wind howling)
