[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.520]   - Love it, love it.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.360]   Welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.880]   friends in Fort Worth, Houston, Tulsa,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.480]   everywhere that you are joining us tonight
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.600]   as we wrap up this series, Bad Advice.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.280]   And we look towards next week,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.480]   which you already heard about, The Unseen,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.940]   as we just explore what it looks like as Christians
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.520]   to fight and battle in the spiritual realm
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.360]   and spiritual warfare.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.960]   So tonight we'll wrap up the series Bad Advice.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.920]   I'm gonna start with a story
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.480]   that'll give us some traction for where we're going.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.880]   When I was a senior in college at Texas A&M,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.960]   me and some, (audience cheering)
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.000]   man, it is Aggies here.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.200]   Did not see that coming.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.840]   My senior year of spring break,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.160]   me and three other friends decided,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.400]   hey, we're gonna go on a road trip.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.840]   It's our last spring break of all time.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.040]   You don't get these in the real world.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.880]   So we're really excited.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.580]   We're gonna go take a road trip together.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.640]   We will decide the destinations of the road trip
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.840]   at some later point.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.880]   So we had just talked about this idea conceptually.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.880]   And then as we got closer and closer to spring break,
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.000]   we're like, we'll figure it out when we get there.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.680]   None of us were really planners,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.160]   but the four of us total would go on a road trip.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.440]   The day before spring break begins, it's Friday,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.780]   everyone's left town.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.520]   We're sitting in College Station trying to figure out
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.000]   what are we gonna do for spring break?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760]   We decide we're either gonna go west
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.920]   or we're gonna go east.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.320]   And we'll just throw a number on three,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.720]   one for west, two for east.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   We'll do a collective vote.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.280]   It's a democracy.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.220]   And we throw a vote, one, two, three, shoot.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.960]   And east won as a count of three to one.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.680]   So we get in the car and we just take off going east.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.160]   We're gonna do a road trip for the next eight days.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160]   In the car, the ways that we decide
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.320]   what destinations we're gonna go to
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.440]   would just be whoever was a part out of the four of us
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.880]   that either knew someone in the town that we could go to
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.680]   and go to stay at 'cause we're poor college students
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.680]   or who had a desire to really see something east of Texas
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.840]   would be a part.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.080]   And we just allow that to factor in.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.940]   Collectively, we would decide the destination.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.580]   So we take off, we head up towards Tennessee,
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.100]   stop in Memphis, walk in in Memphis, see Graceland,
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.220]   which is really not that impressive
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.060]   if you haven't been there.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.840]   But we're stopping there in Nashville.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   Graceland is Elvis's place,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.280]   for those of you who don't know what that is.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.640]   We stop in Nashville.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.680]   We go and see Music City and Knoxville
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.880]   and go in the Smoky Mountains.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.400]   We head to South Carolina, Charleston,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.840]   because somebody had a connection over there,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.700]   just like they had a connection of a place to stay
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.760]   in Knoxville.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.800]   And then we continue on.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.640]   We head towards Savannah, Georgia.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.960]   We didn't have any connections there,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.320]   but one of the guys was like,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.360]   "I did a project in fourth grade on Savannah.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.200]   "How about we go there?"
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.880]   I'm like, "I guess that'll work."
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.400]   And we're out here in the middle of nowhere anyways.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   And so we go to Savannah, we stay there.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.200]   And then another guy was dating a girl at the time
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.600]   in Florida and somehow convinced us
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.360]   to drive hundreds of miles out of the way
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.800]   to go see her and her friends on vacation
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.320]   and hang out with his girlfriend and their girls.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.500]   And that relationship didn't even last, so how about that?
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.340]   And so we drive down there, we stay with them,
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.360]   we hang out there, and then we go to a family member
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.940]   of somebody in the car.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.680]   We stop in Baton Rouge,
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.120]   and then eventually we make it home eight states later
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   or 10 states later,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.640]   however many it was, thousands of miles,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.360]   these guys staying in either a friend's home
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   or America's Best Value Inn, which is, I'm not sure,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.560]   it's a tall claim to be America's Best Value,
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.280]   and I'm not sure it lives up to it.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.620]   It was like the kind of places where you sleep
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.920]   in the sleeping bag on top of the sheets and things,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.040]   'cause what happens in America's Best Value
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.960]   may not stay in America's Best Value.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.620]   So all that to say, throughout the entire journey,
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.080]   it was the collective decisions of the group together
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.720]   and the different people involved on the journey,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.280]   the different passengers that spoke into
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.240]   and determined the different destinations
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.480]   and the different directions
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.200]   throughout that journey that we would head.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   Now, why would I start there?
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.480]   Because in the same way, life,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.160]   it almost goes without saying, is a journey.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.320]   And on this journey that each of us is on,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.720]   it is those passengers or the closest relationship to us,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.440]   relationships to us, the closest friends to us, if you will,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.380]   who will determine at every single turn
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.500]   the direction and destinations of your life and of my life.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.660]   Like if I was to say, hey,
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.120]   who are your five closest friends?
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.360]   Because those friends are going to determine
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.020]   the destinations of who you marry, when you marry,
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.420]   where you work, how your financials go,
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.740]   these different things in your life,
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.020]   you'd be like, that sounds crazy.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.580]   And the reality is, is we're gonna see tonight,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.020]   it's not far from the truth
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.180]   that each of us is on a journey
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.060]   and the passengers or the people closest to us in life
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.500]   will determine the direction of our life,
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.340]   the destinations that we're headed towards.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.880]   The simplest way to say it would be friends determine,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.780]   each of us friends, the relationship we have with friends
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.900]   determine the direction and destination of our lives.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.660]   Now, why or what does that have to do with bad advice?
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.180]   Well, that brings us to tonight's topic
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.000]   as we wrap up the series,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.560]   which is the final piece of bad advice
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.680]   which relates to friendship.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.700]   And it's this piece of bad advice,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.900]   that I can't abandon my friends.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.860]   I can't turn my back on my friends.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.300]   You know, they're my people.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.140]   I can't just walk away from them
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.100]   just 'cause I'm kinda growing in this whole God thing.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.500]   I'm stepping into deeper levels of my faith.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.420]   I can't though totally walk away and abandon,
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.420]   I can't change my friends ride or die, man.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.340]   I can't go away from these people.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.960]   And the reason that is bad advice
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.700]   is because just like in that situation
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.140]   where hey, the friends determine the direction
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.900]   and destination of your life.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.980]   If your friends are not headed in the right direction
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.460]   or they're headed in the wrong direction,
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.280]   they are gonna take along with them you
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.460]   is collateral damage.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.940]   That if you and I live by the mindset of man,
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.400]   I just, I can't abandon my friends
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.620]   despite the fact that the friends
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.180]   that I don't want to separate from
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.740]   or put some distance between are gonna pull me down.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.480]   It's gonna cost you.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.260]   And it's gonna cost me.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.740]   Tonight, we're specifically gonna look at
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.340]   what the Bible has to say
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.100]   as it gives us just a couple principles
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.300]   related to the idea of how powerful friendship is,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.820]   how dangerous it is if you and I associate
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.320]   or live in close relationship with,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.620]   allow us to be under the influence
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.060]   of people who are not headed in the right direction,
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.540]   people who are not following Jesus, if you will,
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.380]   and seeking to align themselves with other people do.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.140]   Tonight's bad advice or tonight's principles
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.520]   from God's word, if you apply them,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.260]   here's what I know about you and here's what I know about me.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.240]   Almost every other message that we covered here
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.820]   with maybe a couple exceptions,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.740]   if you apply the principles from God's word tonight,
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.700]   the rest of your life really is gonna figure itself out.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.400]   And your life is gonna experience
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.720]   so much of the way that God intended and designed
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.540]   and really the future, the preferred future that you want.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.020]   And if you don't apply and I don't apply
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.740]   what Solomon and the Apostle Paul
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.980]   are gonna tell us tonight,
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.980]   then what's at stake is far more than just friend circles
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.940]   but our faith as people wander from the faith
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.360]   because of a result of refusing to say,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.180]   I'm gonna cut off these relationships for a season.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.160]   Your future in terms of even your own life,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.700]   Solomon's gonna say.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.800]   And so we're gonna explore two principles,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.460]   two principles as it relates to friendship
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.660]   and a person that you and I are to look for
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.140]   or to make sure to have in our closest circle of friends.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.120]   We're gonna start in 1 Corinthians 15 and just look up.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.740]   Normally we teach a passage of scripture.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.380]   We'll pick one passage of scripture,
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.700]   pull out three points and go from there.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.260]   Really tonight we're gonna look at these three
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.140]   different passages of scripture
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.460]   and pull out two principles
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.980]   and then the person that all of us are to look for.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.620]   The first one comes 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.580]   If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screen.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.940]   And in verse 33 where Paul says this
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.940]   as it relates to the topic of friendship.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.340]   Do not be deceived.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.980]   Bad company ruins or you may have corrupts good morals.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.860]   Do not be deceived.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.800]   Why would Paul have to say do not be deceived?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.680]   Bad company corrupts good morals.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.060]   Do not be deceived as in like,
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.580]   or your version may say don't mislead.
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.820]   As in people are deceived by this idea
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.460]   that I can hang out with people
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.020]   who have a different standard of morality than I do,
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.900]   who have a different convictions around what they believe,
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.740]   who have different morals than I do
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.220]   and it won't get off on me.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.040]   It won't impact me.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.380]   And Paul would say you are being deceived.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.100]   You cannot spend time with people
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.800]   who have a morality that differs from you
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.600]   and not be affected by it.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.480]   The first idea from this text that Paul's gonna say
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   is that man, your friends are more powerful
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.540]   than your convictions.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.120]   Our friends are more powerful
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.280]   and stronger than our convictions.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.880]   Our friends are stronger than our convictions.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.080]   That if you run with the wrong people,
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.040]   there's not enough sermons in the world to save you
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   from being impacted and being led astray, Paul would say.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.440]   There's not enough churches in.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.280]   It's like, in other words,
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.360]   if you come every single Tuesday night
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.080]   where you're hanging with the wrong people,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.280]   you are going to be impacted by it
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.420]   and you're gonna be pulled in the wrong direction
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.260]   of your life,
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.160]   that our friends have more power over our convictions.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.820]   We've all like seen this.
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.920]   If you look back at any nature
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.360]   and kind of the decisions in your past
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.420]   and how they're influenced
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.320]   by not conviction level decisions often,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.880]   but by the company that we keep.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.360]   If you have ever smoked a cigarette before,
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.200]   the first cigarette you smoked, here's what I know,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.040]   you were probably with somebody.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.600]   In other words, you didn't wake up one day,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.440]   be like, you know what?
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.680]   Today's my day, I'm doing it.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.320]   Let's do this, get a pack.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.840]   Somebody introduced it to you.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.000]   The first alcohol, whatever drink you had,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.020]   the first time you smoked pot, whatever it is,
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.120]   you were in the context, in the company of somebody else,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.480]   that it was in the company of people
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.680]   that you made that decision.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   Whatever your sexual history is, here's what I know,
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.360]   it is connected to the friends that you ran with,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.080]   either in high school or in college
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.360]   or whenever you began stepping into
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.600]   whatever that sexual activity looked like.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.420]   All of us have been shaped by the company that we keep.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.720]   It's stronger than the conviction we have.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.980]   Just like not only does it happen not in isolation,
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.740]   so many of the decisions and so many addictions even start
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.440]   because of the company that we kept.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.560]   We were introduced to something through someone's.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.560]   Pornography, for many of us, like my story,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.760]   was introduced in the context of other people.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.720]   Wouldn't just randomly sought after
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.480]   individually in isolation.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.400]   And not only that, you can see that the company
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.080]   is stronger than the convictions you hold
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.040]   because just like in that situation with the cigarettes,
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.760]   it wouldn't just like in isolation that you do it,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.160]   but it's also not, generally speaking,
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.400]   a result of you changing your convictions on something.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.260]   Like the first time you smoked marijuana,
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.720]   probably wasn't because you're like,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.000]   you know what, it's an herb.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.960]   I think it's from the earth.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.220]   My convictions on this have really shifted.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.640]   Does anyone have marijuana?
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.500]   No, it was when somebody introduced it to you
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.800]   and you were like, you know what,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.760]   you know, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.600]   It's legal in Colorado, who cares?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.540]   And all of a sudden, you made a decision
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.320]   not based on the conviction level changed,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.060]   but influenced and determined by the company that you keep.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.880]   And Paul says if you run with the wrong people,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.360]   you will run in the wrong direction every single time,
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.380]   no matter how good your church attendance is,
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.580]   no matter how much Bible you read
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.860]   and how good your quiet times are,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.200]   if you surround yourself with the wrong people,
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.680]   you will move your life in the wrong direction.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.040]   And it's going to cost you and it's gonna cost me.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.000]   We've all seen it.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.640]   It's almost cliche at this point to say
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.560]   like none of us, we're just not strong enough
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.280]   at a conviction level.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.500]   Like if you're back in church,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.560]   maybe for the first time in a while,
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.760]   maybe you have been joining us for a while
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.120]   and you're like, dude, I just love the porch, man,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.200]   positive vibes, I feel like God's at work in my life
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.640]   and growing and I wanna continue this journey,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.320]   but I'm trying to figure out how to care for my friends
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.420]   'cause I want them to experience
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.000]   what I'm getting to experience.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.600]   And people will come down and they'll just be like,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.160]   so really what I'm doing is using an opportunity
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.760]   to just be like a light in the world.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.160]   I'm just trying to be a light, we're hanging out.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.920]   And so when we go out, for the next six weeks,
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.480]   I'm gonna be the designated driver.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.140]   I'm gonna be designated driver,
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.320]   which slowly moves into, you know what,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.400]   it's her birthday, I'm gonna have one birthday shot,
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.240]   we're gonna do an Uber.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.120]   We're gonna do an Uber, one birthday shot.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.980]   All of a sudden, oh man, well, a couple of drinks,
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.260]   it's her birthday, we're gonna go out, it's her birthday.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.120]   And on and on and on from there it goes.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.400]   And there's always something to celebrate.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.880]   It's always like, it's Bob's one year anniversary at work.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.680]   You know, it's Fourth of July, it's St. Patrick's Day,
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.600]   it's Earth Day, there's always something.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.460]   And all of a sudden, you've moved in the direction.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.160]   And the company that you keep is stronger
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.640]   than whatever conviction you make,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.320]   whatever New Year's resolution you make,
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.960]   whatever discipline that you try to enforce.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.640]   The company that you and I keep is going to determine
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.500]   and is stronger than the convictions
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.660]   that you and I will hold.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.000]   It's stronger, think about this, in your faith,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.600]   that it has the ability to impact you
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.040]   like nothing else in life.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.400]   And Paul says, do not be deceived, don't be a fool.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.920]   Don't deceive yourself, don't be deceived.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.880]   The company you keep is stronger
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.380]   than the convictions you hold.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.880]   It's just a principle.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.200]   And a principle is one of those things
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.440]   that like any time that you violate it,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.840]   or any time that you go against it,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.200]   you don't break the principle, it breaks you.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.040]   Like if you keep company and you run with fools,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.320]   it's going to hurt you.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.840]   You cannot, the company you keep is stronger
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.680]   than the conviction you hold.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.920]   And Paul says it's just a principle.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.840]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.280]   I think this is, yeah.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.200]   So here's what this is.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.520]   What if I was like, nevermind.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.360]   Okay.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.920]   Like an animal or something jumps out.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.800]   Okay, so this is what I call a piece of paper.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.360]   We've all seen one of these before.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.560]   This is, 'cause that's what it is.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.400]   And this is fire.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.440]   You know what happens when you take fire and paper together?
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.600]   Man.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.160]   When you put fire and paper together,
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.220]   something happens every single time
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.660]   based on the principle of what it is.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.660]   It all of a sudden begins to burn.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.120]   Okay, so there's one.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.480]   So this piece of paper is different.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.600]   This piece of paper is disciplined.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.760]   It's memorized a lot of Bible verses.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.640]   It comes to the porch every Tuesday night,
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.380]   and it is committed to not catching on fire
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.240]   despite getting close to the fire.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   Here's what's gonna happen,
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.880]   or we'll just see how well it does.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.500]   Well, oh well, I guess that didn't work.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.340]   Why?
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.780]   Because the principle behind it
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.700]   is that any time you take paper,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.520]   thank you, I'll be here all night.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.920]   Any time you take paper and fire
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.980]   and you put 'em together, it's gonna burn.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.040]   It's just a principle.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.620]   Paul says it is a principle.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.080]   The company that you keep is going to either corrupt
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.380]   or you are going to conform to the morals
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.720]   of the company that you keep.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.840]   It's a principle.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   You cannot keep the wrong company and not get burned.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.360]   And if you and I are not careful
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   to make sure that we surround ourselves,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.600]   the closest relationships that we have
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.360]   are people who are like-minded, faith-driven,
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.160]   focused on that and not pulling us down.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.880]   Paul says the company you keep is stronger
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.840]   than the convictions that you're gonna hold.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.800]   So that's our first principle.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.920]   Our second principle comes from Solomon, King Solomon,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.360]   who was the wisest man who ever lived.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.960]   Solomon, who wrote the book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.080]   He was a guy who was king of Israel.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.400]   God basically came to him and said,
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.080]   "Hey, I'm gonna allow you to have,
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.380]   "you can ask me for whatever you want
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.400]   "and I'll give you that thing."
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.920]   Solomon said, "Hey, give me wisdom to rule your people."
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.840]   God says, "Man, because you did that,
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.760]   "I'm gonna give you wisdom
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.600]   "and just tons of favor and blessing."
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.680]   Solomon becomes the wisest man who ever lives.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.920]   And he, interestingly enough,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.900]   if anyone you would think is so wise
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.400]   that they really don't need to write a ton
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.460]   about getting wise counsel and other relationships,
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.300]   it would be him.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.600]   Solomon writes more about the importance
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.280]   of having good friends, wise friends,
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.120]   and wise counselors than anyone else in the Bible.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.080]   And here's what he says as it relates
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.760]   to the companions that you keep
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.520]   or the people that influence your life.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.300]   This is Proverbs 13, verse 20.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.240]   So be on the screen in case you wanna flip there
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.600]   or in case you don't flip there.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.060]   "Whoever walks with or lives with
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.320]   "or lives under the direction of, influence of,
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.020]   "the wise becomes wise."
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.840]   In other words, if you live with a wise person,
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.520]   a wise person, biblically speaking,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.340]   is someone who knows God and seeks to follow God's way.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.760]   Whoever walks with someone who knows God
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.280]   and seeks to follow God's way,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.120]   it's like that wiseness gets off on 'em.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.960]   You catch it.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.400]   If you hang around wise people, you're gonna catch it.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.240]   And then he says this,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   "But the companion of fools will suffer harm."
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.200]   Then in other words, it's not the companion of fools.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.320]   If you become, hang on with wise, you're gonna become wise.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.720]   You hang on with fools and you get hurt,
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.160]   is what Solomon says.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.960]   You don't just become a fool.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.200]   You end up experiencing pain as a result of it
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.840]   inside of your life and inside of my life
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.400]   that Solomon tells us.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.800]   And a fool, biblically speaking,
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.840]   is someone who knows the difference between right and wrong
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.500]   and just doesn't care.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.640]   Like, there's someone who you're like,
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.080]   "Dude, you know if you get caught with that,
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.680]   "you could go to jail."
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.720]   They're not like, "Oh my gosh, are you serious?
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.360]   "We gotta get rid of this right now."
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.300]   They're like, "Yeah, I don't care.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.140]   "It's not that big of a deal."
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.120]   Or, "Man, it's worth it."
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.280]   Or, "I don't care."
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.760]   A fool is someone who knows the difference
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.880]   and yet doesn't.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.900]   Solomon says, "If you walk with wise, you become wise.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.140]   "If you walk with fools,
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.860]   "you are going to become a fool and pay for it.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.860]   "You're gonna suffer for it."
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.380]   He says, what we've said here before,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.620]   if you show me your friends, I'll show you your future.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.900]   Our second idea from the text,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.100]   the second principle that Scripture tells us
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.660]   is our friends determine our future.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.100]   The friends that you have and the friends that I have
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.020]   will determine your future.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.140]   Here's what I want you to think about.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.700]   Everyone inside of the room,
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.420]   who are your five closest friends?
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.800]   Like, begin to think about 'em.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.220]   You can write 'em down.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.660]   You can elbow, hey, me and you, buddy, besties.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.540]   You can do whatever you want,
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.700]   but think about who are the five closest friends
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.540]   that you have.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:46.740]   It's been long said, what Solomon is alluding to here,
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.860]   that our friends are gonna determine our future.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.260]   Our friends are gonna forecast who we're becoming
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.020]   and the life that we're gonna experience.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.140]   And sociologists have said,
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.540]   hey, man, your five closest friends,
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.860]   you will be the average of your five closest friends.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.980]   You will be impacted by the five closest friends
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.820]   that you have.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.460]   The person you are becoming
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.380]   is directly connected to your five closest friends.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.160]   You and I are the sum of the someones inside of our life.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.940]   Who are the five closest friends
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.500]   and are they the people that are gonna push you?
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.200]   Are they the type of person where you're like,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.500]   man, if I could just continue to move in that direction,
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.380]   if my life continues to move in that direction,
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.240]   I'm excited about that.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.540]   Are you dating someone right now?
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.680]   Man, this is so huge.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.060]   Gosh, if you're boyfriend or girlfriend,
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.940]   if you think about their five closest friends
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.820]   and you're like, man, his friends are idiots,
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.740]   you should have serious pause.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.060]   Even if you're like, yeah, he's such a great guy
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.700]   and his friends are so terrible
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.780]   that in contrast, he's like amazing.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.660]   Every time I'm around him, you should have serious pause.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.380]   I'm being so serious, please.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.660]   Same thing with her.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.460]   Because she is gonna become and she is becoming
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.580]   the average or she's being impacted
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.380]   by her five closest friends, just like you
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.240]   and just like I am inside of my life.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.980]   But Solomon says your friends are gonna determine
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.660]   your future for the better.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.980]   You don't grow your faith in isolation.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.460]   But the Christian faith is lived out
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.180]   and flourishes with other people in our life
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.300]   that help encourage us, hold us accountable.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.020]   So you're either gonna become wise
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.240]   and grow in your faith and grow with others in your life
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.020]   as a result of who you run with
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.300]   or you're gonna experience it for the worse.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.460]   I mean, I think if you're anything like me,
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.080]   the verse, the second half of the verse about,
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.400]   man, if you run with fools, you're gonna experience harm.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.200]   You probably have friends, I have friends
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.660]   that are not alive today because of that.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.440]   Because they got in a car, they'd been drinking too much,
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.600]   they were hanging with fools and they got in an accident.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.840]   There's friends that you may like me have
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.600]   that are on probation because they were hanging
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.060]   with the wrong people and they suffered for it.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.420]   Friends that have spent time in prison
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.760]   because they were with the wrong people
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.040]   and they paid for it.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.440]   And Solomon says, man, you cannot run with fools
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.660]   and not get burned, you will pay for it.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.380]   Surround yourself with wise people,
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.380]   people who are seeking to know God.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.060]   It's gonna harm you if you hang with fools,
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.200]   it'll harm your dating life, your spiritual life,
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.640]   and every arena of your life you're going
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.140]   to experience pain or damage from it.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.940]   Am I telling you that if you look around,
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.420]   you're like, man, these people are really
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.140]   not the type of people who are gonna encourage
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.980]   and push me in our faith.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.720]   Are you saying, David, I need to change my friends?
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.560]   Really?
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.400]   Yes, I'm saying change your friends.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.880]   You need to unfriend them.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.920]   They are hurting you and they're going to hurt you.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.000]   Just like if you've ever broken up with someone before
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.320]   and all of a sudden you go home
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.080]   and you can't stop stalking them on Facebook.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.480]   You're just like, oh my gosh, look,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.680]   she's out with someone else.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.600]   And you have to eventually unfriend them on Facebook
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.440]   because you're like, this is only hurting me.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.900]   In the same way, Solomon would say
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.640]   that there are friends in your life
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.380]   that you have to unfriend, even if it's just for a season,
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.740]   not on social media, in life.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.760]   You have to cut off.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.980]   Does that mean that, hey, you have to not make eye contact
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.820]   and totally avoid?
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.680]   No, it means that, hey, you may have
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.740]   to have some conversations.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.300]   I can't hang out with you on Friday nights
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.000]   at the bar anymore.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.540]   It's not good for me right now.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.380]   We can go to lunch.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.540]   I love you, I care about you, but during this season,
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.020]   man, I just feel like I'm too easily tempted
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.340]   because I'm in a place where, man,
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.500]   I think that I could probably pull people up,
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.880]   but the truth is I'm just gonna get pulled down.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.400]   And Solomon would say, if you run with fools,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.120]   it's gonna cost you every time.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.020]   It's a principle.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.360]   And you don't break principles,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.200]   they break you and they break me.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.360]   All of us, here's what I know about your story
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.860]   and about my story, is like, your story today
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.800]   is like mine, it's been impacted and shaped
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.040]   by this principle, for better or for worse.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.280]   Like, whatever the story you have inside of your life,
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.000]   it has either been one where God has provided
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.580]   good friends or friends, and through those friends
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.900]   and relationships of people who know Jesus,
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.220]   not perfectly, but they just try to walk with him,
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.740]   he's protected you from things.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.640]   Or, that wasn't a part of the story that you had,
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.460]   and you were surrounded by people
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.860]   and you've experienced pain.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.420]   Or you've experienced just making stupid decisions.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.540]   I mean, JP in my story is very, very different,
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.080]   and it's because of this one issue.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.500]   JP's story, like, he'll tell a story,
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.660]   he's like, dude, sat in a bar, you know,
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.220]   smelled like smoke, I was here, here, that was it,
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.380]   and just say things, I'm like, man, what?
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.840]   And he's like, yeah, you know, bottle service
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.680]   and this stripper was over here, I'm like, dude,
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.600]   where were your parents?
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.440]   That's what I wanna know.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.760]   And, like, drugs or things, I'm like, man,
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.920]   the D.A.R.E. program, really, it had an impact on me.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.400]   And, here's the truth, though.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.880]   Is there's no difference between he and I?
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.000]   Around this one issue, like, he was surrounded by fools,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.640]   and the friends that I had, there was nothing good
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.480]   and nothing better about, there's nothing,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.060]   anything good that came out of the story
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.940]   of just God's protection inside of my life
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.100]   was all a result of friends,
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.460]   not a result of anything better or worse.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.820]   And your story, whatever it is,
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.560]   has been shaped by this idea of, like,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.960]   God's source of protection and provision
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.060]   is through relationships with people who know him.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.220]   And his desire for you in the future,
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.540]   as it is already, as you can look back in your past
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.140]   and see the power of relationships,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.700]   his desire for you in the future,
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.820]   because friends determine your future,
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.780]   is that you would have friends who know God,
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.200]   who walk with him, and who wanna help you
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.480]   and encourage you to walk with him.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.380]   The husband or wife you will be someday
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.760]   is being right now shaped by your five closest friends.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.920]   Are they the right friends?
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.620]   Are they the friends that you want to speak into?
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.040]   The man, the woman, the mother that you're gonna be someday.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.500]   Your future is being determined by your friends.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.920]   Are you surrounded by the right people,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   just like your past was determined and shaped
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.360]   by those closest to you?
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.820]   And Solomon would say, walk with wise.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.080]   Walk with wise people.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.100]   And if you don't and you walk with fools,
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.660]   you're gonna pay for it.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:01.140]   Solomon says next, not only how,
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.260]   or not just these two different principles
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.200]   about how our friends determine our future
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.400]   and how our friends are stronger than our convictions,
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.020]   but he really goes into how we are to choose our friends.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.460]   So here's what he says in Proverbs 12, verse 26.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.900]   The righteous, in other words,
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.520]   people who want to live the right life,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.040]   people who know God, wanna walk with him,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.820]   and want to live righteously or rightly,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.160]   they choose their friends carefully.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.540]   Look at that.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.720]   People who wanna live the right life or righteous life,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.200]   they choose their friends carefully.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.400]   The word for choose is literally the word spies,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.320]   as in like they're like sneaking behind the bushes,
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.160]   looking at the friend, being like,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.560]   "Ah, I don't know if this guy's in."
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.080]   That's the word that Solomon says.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.560]   Hey, when it comes to the closest relationships you have,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.080]   the word for friends is literally
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.440]   the word secret inner place.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.680]   Someone who exchanges with you
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.980]   at the most intimate level, he says,
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.580]   "You need to choose very carefully
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.740]   "who's gonna be inside of your inner circle of friends,
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.280]   "inner circle of relationships,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.040]   "but the way of the wicked leads them astray."
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.240]   Our third idea from the text
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.860]   is choose your friends carefully.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.080]   That friends are not, especially, man,
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.400]   as you enter into a young adulthood,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.320]   it's no longer just I met Billy at school by chance.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.940]   The relationships you're gonna have
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.280]   are gonna be forged by choice.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.820]   And he says, "Choose the friends
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.400]   "that you're gonna have carefully."
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.960]   Choose the friends that you're gonna have carefully.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.800]   And so here's where I think we get tripped up,
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.000]   is there's verses like this, and then you go,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.720]   wait a second, but I'm also the light of the world, right?
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.640]   And I'm also, you know, Jesus was a friend of sinners,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.080]   and I'm supposed to go into the world,
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.280]   make disciples of all people,
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.720]   and so how am I supposed to do that
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.480]   with also making sure that I don't hang out
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.040]   with people who corrupt my morals or who are fools?
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.200]   How do I do that tension and walk along that tension well?
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.160]   And the truth is, it is a tension that exists in Scripture.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.740]   But there are seasons inside of your life
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.780]   and inside of my life where as you spiritually grow
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.420]   and as I spiritually grow,
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.260]   we have to cut off the bad companions
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.380]   or friends inside of our life
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.420]   who are just gonna mess with our morals,
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.880]   who are gonna lead us astray from walking in our faith.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.780]   It's like, it's not dissimilar to a tree.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.620]   Like a tree has to have its roots go deeper into the ground
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.600]   before its branches can go wide.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.780]   In other words, the deeper the roots go into the ground,
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.140]   the wider the branches can grow.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.580]   In the same way, the Christian life,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.420]   if you're, man, if you're trying to like grow in your faith,
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.860]   you have got to go deeper spiritually.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.540]   You gotta let the roots of your faith
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.180]   grow deeper into the soil of God's word,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.820]   of God's people, and allow that to be strong
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.260]   so that the reach of your branches,
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.380]   the reach of your friends and influence
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.980]   can be broad and can be wide.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.660]   Tension exists that you and I are to, at times,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.660]   cut off relationships for a season to grow.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.140]   As we say, change your playmates and your playgrounds
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.400]   so that your faith could grow stronger.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.900]   In addition to that, you and I are to make sure
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.340]   that when it comes to the closest level of our relationship,
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.480]   the core people in our life,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.940]   if you're a Christian, it's not an option for you.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.100]   You have to be intentional.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.140]   The core relationships you have must be followers of Jesus
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.540]   because you cannot run with fools,
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.900]   have your closest friends be fools, and not suffer for it.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.620]   It's like this.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.340]   Here's like a graph that'll show a little bit of it.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.500]   So if inside of these three layers of relationships
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.300]   that we have, there's people that we wanna engage with
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.580]   and people we wanna be friends with,
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.140]   people that are not necessarily believers
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.460]   we can pray with, we can hang out,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.520]   you know, go to take to lunch and support
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.080]   and let 'em know that we care about 'em.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.620]   We put those inside of the level of care.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.180]   These are people who are not necessarily believers.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.020]   You work around 'em.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.860]   Maybe they're friends from high school.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.580]   Maybe they're like, hey, she was my best friend
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.320]   since fourth grade, but I just became a Christian,
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.580]   and I'm trying to figure this out.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.000]   You would put her inside of that care circle.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.760]   Then the circle of influence and circle of core.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.260]   These are both circles that are filled
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.260]   with people who are following Jesus,
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   not saying I'm a Christian, people who are following Christ.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.060]   Circle of influence is closer friends
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.740]   or is kind of friends, borderline acquaintances,
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.920]   similar worldview.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.580]   We run in the same circle of influence.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.100]   Then there's the core.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.700]   These would be your community group.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.500]   This would be your closest relationships.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.220]   This is not an option for a believer in Jesus.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.260]   This has to be Christ followers,
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.780]   that the closest people in your life and in my life,
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.180]   the people who are the passengers in the car
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.720]   must be Christians.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.460]   Solomon says, "Choose your friends carefully.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.820]   "Don't be a fool, and choose and make sure
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.060]   "that those inside of your inner circle,
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.040]   "the core, is filled with followers of Christ."
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.760]   Here's three qualities that we said to look for,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.520]   three qualities to look for as it relates to friends,
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.740]   three qualities that relates to those
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.840]   who should be inside of your inner circle and my inner circle.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.120]   First one is that they're following Jesus.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.960]   We already said it.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.140]   They're not a check-the-box Christian.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.560]   The trajectory of their life is following Jesus.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.920]   If you're a guy, other guys.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.640]   If you're a girl, other girls who come alongside of you
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.680]   and they are following Jesus.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.040]   The second one is that they are encouraging you
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.880]   to follow Jesus.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.920]   They're the type of person who is encouraging you
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   in your faith.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.440]   They're the type of person who, like Jonathan to David,
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.980]   and David to Jonathan, says multiple times
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.620]   that Jonathan went out and helped King David,
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.480]   who's an Old Testament figure, find strength in the Lord.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.500]   That you and I are to have people who encourage
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.680]   and help us strengthen our faith.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.940]   People who encourage us on the journey
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.180]   and that we can be a source of encouraging,
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.800]   hey man, I'm gonna help you follow Jesus.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   I know right now that you want to make irrational decisions
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.620]   because of whatever's going on.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.520]   You just broke up.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.460]   I'm gonna be here to support at late
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.300]   in the middle of the night.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.740]   I'm here to come alongside of you
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.000]   because you're feeling like temptation.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.100]   You just want to look at pornography.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.160]   I'm gonna come over and not just say I'm praying for you.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.920]   I'm gonna come right now and pray for you.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.840]   People who will encourage you in your faith.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.680]   They're following Jesus.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.920]   People who are committed to encouraging you
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.760]   inside of your faith.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.720]   And then thirdly, people who will speak the truth to you.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.400]   People who will speak the truth to you.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.240]   It's so sad.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.480]   Proverbs 27 says that faithful are the wounds of a friend,
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.700]   but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.320]   That a true friend will love you enough at times
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.480]   to tell you the truth and tell me the truth and wound me.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.420]   And here's the thing about wounding,
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.060]   no matter who it's coming from, it never feels great.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:20.120]   But Solomon would say, man, if you have true friends,
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.660]   there will be times where they speak the truth to you
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.380]   and they're faithful to wound you.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.060]   Do you have friends in your life
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.380]   who will love you enough to say, man, I see this in you?
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.340]   Has anyone ever brought this up to you?
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.540]   I feel like the way you responded then was a little off.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.220]   Has anyone ever told you that before?
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.060]   Am I crazy?
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:40.900]   I could be wrong.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.980]   People who love you enough to speak the truth
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.340]   and who you love enough to speak the truth,
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.220]   that inside of your inner core,
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.860]   they gotta be following Jesus.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.980]   They gotta be people who will encourage you
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.980]   and help strengthen you in your faith and you in theirs,
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.380]   and then people who are willing to speak the truth to you.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.300]   Here's the application for tonight.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.440]   We're about to come close, land.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.740]   Some of you guys, this Sunday,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.100]   you need to come to Watermark at 1115.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.380]   You need to be a part of the community formation groups.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.740]   If you've gone through the membership process,
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.700]   this is your Sunday.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.860]   It is your time to step out,
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.340]   to change your playmates and your playgrounds.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.520]   If you wanna step away from whatever relationships
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.180]   you feel like are pulling you down and you're like,
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.140]   yeah, am I just supposed to be lonely all the time?
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.140]   Is that what you want from me?
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.420]   No, the Bible doesn't want that for you.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.180]   It wants you to have the best relationships,
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.100]   the most healthy relationships you could ever have.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.980]   And the means by which we attempt to create environments
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.780]   to do that here at Watermark is called community groups.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.380]   It's the single best thing we do.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.420]   If you have to choose between the porch and community groups,
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.660]   go to community, be in a community group every single time.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.420]   Go to community group every single time
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.260]   over coming to the porch.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.860]   It is the best thing that we do here.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.940]   This Sunday at 1115, you can go to watermark.org
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.780]   and find out more information about getting
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.900]   into a community group,
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.460]   community formation in stage two C,
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.500]   stage two C in the tower, in the tower.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.040]   Second floor of the tower, second floor of the tower.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.100]   In your phone, 1115, second floor of the tower
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.660]   across the community formation groups.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.260]   Some of you need to delete phone numbers.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.140]   And you're probably not going to 'cause you're like,
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.080]   ah, come on, you know.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.240]   But there's people in your life you just gotta cut off.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.980]   And they keep pulling you down, they keep tempting you.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.380]   You may need to leave here and make a phone call.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.040]   You may need to set up a meeting.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.700]   But Solomon would say, you cannot break a principle.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.920]   If you go against it, it will break you.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.340]   If you run with fools, you're gonna be a fool
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.900]   and you're gonna pay for it.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.300]   And I'm gonna pay for it.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.980]   It's not like a, man, the pastor's exempt,
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.000]   all of us will.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.260]   If the people inside of your life and inside of my life
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.840]   are not following Jesus, if the people inside of your core
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.640]   and inside of my core are not seeking to encourage
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.960]   and motivate me in addition to following their faith
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.040]   and speaking the truth, you and I are not experiencing
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.680]   what God's design for us is as it relates to relationships.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.520]   In conclusion, our friends are stronger
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.700]   than our convictions.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.280]   Our friends will determine the future that you and I have.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.740]   And then Solomon says, man, choose your friends carefully.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.820]   Let me just address this last thing.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.800]   I think that the biggest obstacle to this,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.580]   the reason why so many of you are not gonna actually apply
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.820]   and not gonna do what Solomon says
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.580]   is because that emotional feeling of like,
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.700]   man, yeah, but I just can't leave my friends behind.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.860]   Like, that just doesn't feel loyal and I care about 'em.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.500]   And I really think, you know, they kinda need me
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.100]   and I need to be there for 'em and, you know,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.380]   I can hang out with 'em on the weekend
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.720]   and just show 'em a light and still go
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.280]   to wherever they're going and I'll just kinda
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.480]   try to be different.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.860]   And here's what I want you to know.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.620]   You are leaving your friends behind
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:01.780]   by showing them a watered-down Christianity,
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.580]   a Christianity that really doesn't change kinda everything,
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.100]   that really doesn't do anything too dramatic,
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.580]   that still allows me to have one foot in the world
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.420]   and one foot out.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.380]   You're leaving your friends behind.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.780]   You are showing them and you're confusing them.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.900]   You're showing them that, hey, this kinda faith thing
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.380]   is really not that big of a deal.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.500]   You're like, like if you and your five closest friends
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   got into a plane crash and you were the only one
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.620]   who was able physically to walk, everyone was injured
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.580]   to the point where they really couldn't walk
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.900]   and you were like, man, I would go get help for all of us
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.760]   but I don't wanna leave my friends behind.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.860]   You were deciding you're gonna leave all of 'em behind.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.580]   Forever.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.260]   Or you can decide, man, I'm gonna go get help
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.900]   and then bring that help back.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.900]   Bring others around that can help my friends.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.340]   You, if you are deciding that I'm gonna kinda live
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.860]   this halfway in, halfway out Christianity,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.360]   you're leaving those friends behind.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.580]   You are doing the very thing that you're trying to avoid
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.600]   and it is confusing and it is hurting the name of Jesus.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.980]   The God who is there is looking for a generation
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.820]   just like ours who will come together and say,
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.420]   man, we're gonna lock arms as believers in Jesus.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.380]   Every single one of us needs one another.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.300]   We need relationships of people who encourage us,
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.980]   hold us accountable and spur us on to love and good deeds,
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.140]   myself very much included, probably more than everybody here
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.500]   because I know that inside of my heart
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.400]   there's just a tendency to run from God,
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.180]   to run towards things that are gonna hurt my marriage,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.860]   hurt my life, hurt me in general
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:35.220]   and every one of us needs that and here's what I know,
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.400]   the capacity or the ceiling on which God wants
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.860]   to use your life, wants to broaden the reach
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.580]   that you're gonna have in terms of reaching people,
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.420]   the ceiling on which he's gonna use that is capped.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.140]   If you reject, what are the primary ways
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.740]   that he's gonna grow those roots deep
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.740]   which is the people of God inside of your life?
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.860]   Who's inside of your core?
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.680]   Are the closest relationships you have followers of Jesus?
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.100]   Are they following Jesus?
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.300]   Are they willing to speak the truth to you?
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.460]   They love you enough to speak the truth
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.540]   and are they encouraging you inside of your faith?
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.180]   Do you have people you're running with like that?
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.540]   In addition to this Sunday, tonight,
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.940]   you can go tonight upstairs afterwards,
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.020]   we have something called First Step,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.560]   it's a chance for you to find out just the ways
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.020]   to connect and step forward into other relationships
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.260]   with believers, life is hard but it is so much harder
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.940]   when you walk through it alone and you were never
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.520]   intended to, even if you got friends,
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.540]   if they're not friends like the ones
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.580]   that Solomon describes and Paul lays out,
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.180]   they're not friends like God intends for you to have
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.860]   and me to have, let me pray.
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.560]   Father, thank you just for the wisdom that you gave us
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.940]   from Solomon and his Proverbs and his teachings,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.980]   would you protect us through the provision
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.460]   of your people inside of our life?
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.060]   You say in Psalm 91 that he who dwells in the shelter
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.600]   of the Most High will abide in the shadow
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.980]   of the Almighty God and the shelter laid out
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.180]   all over scripture is your word and your people,
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.740]   would we abide in deep relationship with your people?
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.200]   And would we experience the protection and provision
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.700]   of you in that, I pray for my friends in the room
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.660]   who know that they need to walk away,
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.420]   who know that they need to change their playmates
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.580]   in their playground, that you would be enough,
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.960]   that you would win in their heart,
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.220]   in the midst of how challenging and difficult
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.380]   that really is to step towards new relationships,
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.020]   would you win and would you move my friends
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.940]   into deeper relationship with you
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.540]   through deepening their relationships
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.860]   with other Christ followers in their life?
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.740]   We worship you now in song, amen.
