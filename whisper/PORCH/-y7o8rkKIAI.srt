1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,760
 Amen, amazing.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,960
 Hello, friends in the room.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,560
 Hello, friends in Fort Worth and friends in Houston.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,000
 I'm gonna start with a story

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,920
 that'll kinda give us traction for where we're going.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,860
 I have a 10-week-old son named Crew.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,640
 Last week, I was going to, yeah, get excited.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,400
 Last week, I was going to pick him up

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,880
 to leave for work in the morning,

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,100
 and I went and picked him up

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,940
 and just held him, gave him a hug,

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,280
 and as I'm holding him,

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,440
 I realize he's got this cross-eyed look,

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,400
 which is not that unusual going on in his face,

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,520
 but something's going on,

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,120
 and he looked milk drunk,

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,200
 which is also not uncommon 'cause he loves milk,

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,120
 and I'm looking at him, I'm like,

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,440
 "All right, buddy, goodbye,"

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,680
 and right as I go to kiss him on the cheek,

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,440
 I get milk thrown up all over my face.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,560
 It is a got milk commercial gone bad,

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,640
 all over my face, it's all over the floor,

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,360
 and I'm like, "Oh, my gosh,"

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,760
 and the reason why he had thrown up

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,620
 is because really, he does this all the time.

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,200
 It's not because he's sick.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,320
 He's in this weird stage of life

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,120
 where he can't get enough milk,

31
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,400
 and even if he drinks until he's full,

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,840
 he throws up, and then he wants more.

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,080
 He's just a little milk monster

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,600
 wanting to go to Dairy Queen all the time,

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,800
 and so he comes up, and he's throwing up on my face,

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,160
 and I'm cleaning this up.

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,280
 Of course, he wants more milk,

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,680
 and we're like, "Buddy, you're okay.

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,700
 "You don't need any more milk.

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,540
 "It's okay."

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,360
 He's crying.

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,200
 He goes ballistic if he doesn't get more milk,

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,640
 and so we live in this world right now

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,360
 where we are constantly having to deal

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,080
 with this 10-week-old who,

46
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,240
 even though he has more than enough,

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,640
 he is discontent and wants to have more.

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,720
 He just purges out and wants more milk for whatever reason.

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,560
 It helps him soothe.

50
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,560
 It helps him find comfort,

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,920
 and the fact that he has enough is not enough for him.

52
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,240
 He's discontent despite having enough.

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,200
 And the reason I start there is because tonight,

54
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,200
 like Shane said, we are talking about the topic of money

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,880
 and the topic of discontentment

56
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,920
 because the idea of an infant wanting more milk

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,480
 despite he's full and, "Hey, I had enough,

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,680
 "but I still want more,"

59
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,660
 is kind of okay for an infant

60
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,760
 when he's in that little stage,

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,280
 but honestly, I think if most of us were honest,

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,040
 we would say that stage of being discontent

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,240
 despite having enough, "I still want more,"

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,800
 despite having enough, "I still want more

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,720
 "and more and more,"

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,160
 is not something that is only for infants

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,200
 and only related to milk,

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,280
 but it's very related to the topic of money.

69
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,960
 Most of us in the room came into the room

70
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,600
 with probably more than enough.

71
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,360
 In a global perspective, we'd say,

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,260
 "We have more than enough,

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,880
 "but there's still something inside of us

74
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,160
 "that is discontent and wants more,

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,200
 "wants more, wants more."

76
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
 And if that wasn't bad enough, we live in a world,

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,960
 and social media has made this so we further are exposed

78
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,880
 and further encouraged to be discontent

79
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,080
 because everywhere we look,

80
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,680
 we are exposed to how much we're missing out on,

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
 how much everyone else is getting to do that's fun,

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
 and you can, with a click of a button,

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,420
 go and see, "Oh my gosh, Instagram.

84
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,800
 "Oh, they're in Maui again.

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
 "I hate them.

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,900
 "Oh man, I wish my job allowed me to travel like that.

87
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,200
 "Oh, I wish I could drive a new car like that.

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
 "Oh, I wish I was self-employed.

89
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
 "Wish I made that kind of money.

90
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,540
 "I wish I had that many pairs of shoes,

91
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,160
 "or I wish I had that many,"

92
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,520
 or insert Pinterest or whatever it is.

93
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,760
 We are in this culture and in this place and time

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,400
 where we're further exposed to how much we don't have,

95
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,040
 further enabled to be more and more discontent.

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
 In fact, tonight, as it relates to the topic of money,

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,120
 we strategically planted inside of this room

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,040
 and inside of Fort Worth a few hundred dollars

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,600
 to further drive some discontentment

100
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,480
 and to use as an illustration later in this message.

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
 And so underneath some of your seats right now,

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,600
 you can look, and there is a $100 bill.

103
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,520
 There's a $50 bill.

104
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,340
 I'm not kidding.

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,400
 I would look if I were you.

106
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,100
 It's in your seat right now.

107
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,800
 Not directly underneath.

108
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,560
 It's on the back of your seat pad.

109
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
 There's an envelope.

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,880
 If you found it, there should be one right down here.

111
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,920
 There should be one somewhere over here.

112
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,040
 Yeah, people are checking other chairs.

113
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,240
 I love it.

114
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,360
 It's starting to move.

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
 This is fantastic.

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,440
 Oh man, if you were not discontent before, you are now.

117
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,320
 (audience laughing)

118
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
 There it is.

119
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
 Yeah, there you go.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
 There's one.

121
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,400
 There's some in Fort Worth too.

122
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
 Directly underneath your chair, on the back of your seat.

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,900
 If you don't get it, there should be at least six

124
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,300
 in this room, and we're gonna come back

125
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,940
 to why those are there.

126
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,940
 (laughing)

127
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,580
 But congratulations if you're sitting

128
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,180
 in one of those chairs.

129
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,020
 Underneath the back.

130
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,840
 Does that make sense?

131
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,380
 So it's not directly underneath where you could see it.

132
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,920
 It's on the very back of your chair.

133
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,340
 You'd have to like, if you reach the hand

134
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,720
 directly behind you.

135
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,700
 Oh, there you go.

136
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
 Okay, don't reach back and grab somebody's leg.

137
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,260
 Just reach back and you may find it.

138
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,700
 Okay, here we go.

139
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,520
 We're gonna keep going.

140
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,080
 Everyone, I've lost the crowd.

141
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,720
 Let me close in prayer, and we'll end tonight.

142
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,960
 We got one, two, I bet we have six.

143
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,260
 So if you don't have it, you can look afterwards

144
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,280
 and you'll be able to find it.

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,420
 Here's why we, actually I'm gonna come back

146
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,180
 to why those have been strategically planted there.

147
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,400
 But if you weren't discontented before, you are now.

148
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,680
 And as we topically address the subject of money

149
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,520
 and how we, as we enter into the world of adulting

150
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
 or really enter into what it looks like

151
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,160
 as followers of Christ to handle money,

152
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,840
 we want to dive into a passage in 1 Timothy 6.

153
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there

154
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,460
 because we live in a world, like we just said,

155
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,280
 that fuels this idea of discontent,

156
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,260
 that fuels the desire to get more and more

157
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,800
 and more and more and more money.

158
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,880
 And the Apostle Paul is going to say that desire,

159
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,400
 that discontent, that you did not just come into the room

160
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,080
 and gain discontent by that $100.

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
 In other words, all of us came in,

162
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,280
 and before we had ever known that the person sitting next

163
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,920
 to us just got 50 bucks, we were discontent.

164
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,440
 And we're gonna come back to why those were put

165
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,920
 in the places that they were.

166
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,800
 But all of us came in, and the Apostle Paul's

167
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,180
 about to lay out that there is a remedy for discontentment.

168
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,680
 But he's also gonna lay out that there is an extreme danger

169
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
 in discontentment, and the danger is not just,

170
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,400
 oh, you know, you're gonna have a bad day.

171
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,760
 What he says is at stake is not just your future,

172
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,280
 but your faith, that it has the potential to erode

173
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,520
 and destroy your faith, which will then destroy

174
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,800
 every aspect of your life.

175
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
 And so what the Apostle Paul's gonna lay out

176
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,880
 as we explore the topic of contentment and money

177
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,660
 and what the scripture says about these two.

178
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,200
 We're gonna start in verse six of chapter six.

179
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
 So if you have a Bible, flip to 1 Timothy chapter six.

180
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,240
 Starting in verse six.

181
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,520
 If you don't, it'll be up on the screen.

182
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,560
 1 Timothy is a book written to Timothy,

183
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
 and it was written by the Apostle Paul

184
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,040
 to this young church leader who's named Timothy.

185
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
 He's a young adult.

186
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,680
 He's leading this church in Ephesus,

187
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,260
 and he had been mentored by Paul.

188
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,720
 Paul was like a, he was Paul's protege, if you will.

189
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,480
 Paul mentored him, and he writes this letter

190
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,600
 to this young adult who's leading this church,

191
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,360
 and he begins to attack or address the topic

192
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,240
 of money and contentment.

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,800
 And we're diving into a conversation

194
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,520
 that had already been taking place in the verses before it

195
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,360
 where he's addressing false teachers who had come up,

196
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,600
 who had said, "Godliness is a means to get financial gain."

197
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
 That's in the verse right before it,

198
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,040
 if you wanna go back and read it later.

199
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,600
 Basically, he's saying, "Look out for people

200
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,740
 "who are gonna come, and they're gonna say,

201
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,060
 "Look, if you're godly, you're gonna get more money.

202
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,800
 "If you give God a dollar, he's gonna give you 10."

203
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,200
 That's the kind of person, Timothy,

204
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,280
 you need to stay away from.

205
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,200
 That person is not doing the Lord's work, he says.

206
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,040
 "Godliness is a means of financial gain is corrupt."

207
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,680
 But there is a godliness that leads to a gain,

208
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
 and it involves something else

209
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,400
 along the topic of commitment.

210
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,280
 So verse six, here we go.

211
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,880
 We're gonna start out with this first idea

212
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,880
 from the text of contentment has nothing to do with money.

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,000
 And if you're sitting next to the person with $50,

214
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,860
 you may not believe me now,

215
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,560
 but hopefully by the end of this message, you will.

216
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,640
 Contentment has nothing to do with money.

217
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,540
 Here's what he says in verse six.

218
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,560
 "Don't be fooled by those who have said

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,740
 "godliness is a way to get financial gain,

220
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,800
 "but here's where gain is.

221
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,540
 "But godliness with contentment is great gain."

222
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,560
 So he's contrasting the idea of financial gain,

223
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,400
 and he says, "Look, there is a great gain

224
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,280
 "that comes from godliness, but it is a godliness

225
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,680
 "that is paired up with contentment,

226
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
 "that I'm okay, I'm satisfied,

227
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,380
 "I don't have to have more, I'm not in constant need

228
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,280
 "of wanting more and more and more stuff.

229
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,740
 "That if you have a discontentment problem,

230
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,920
 "your solution, money, is not the answer to your problem."

231
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,520
 In other words, getting more and more.

232
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,840
 What he says, he says, "There is no relationship

233
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,000
 "between contentment and money.

234
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,560
 "If you get more money, you will not be any more content,"

235
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
 the apostle Paul says.

236
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,200
 "If you get more and more, you will not be any more content.

237
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,540
 "The more you have, not necessarily

238
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,400
 "the less that you want.

239
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
 "Getting more will not leave you wanting less."

240
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
 We know this, right?

241
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,160
 There isn't a relationship between our happiness in life,

242
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,240
 our contentment in life, our joy, our satisfaction,

243
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,400
 and the things that we acquire.

244
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
 There is for like an hour and a half,

245
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
 and then it's like, "Ah, this is kind of worthless.

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,240
 "I want the next one."

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
 We live in a world where constantly,

248
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,320
 especially as Americans, probably the clearest way

249
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,120
 you see this is with your phone, right?

250
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,320
 Who has the iPhone 6 right here?

251
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,160
 Anybody?

252
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
 Who has the iPhone 6S?

253
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,420
 Oh my gosh, I love it.

254
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,320
 We live in a world where we're constantly being bombarded

255
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,200
 with, "Hey, upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.

256
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
 "Get this next one."

257
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,980
 And when we get it, it's like, "This is awesome.

258
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,200
 "I'm gonna keep this clean for like three days."

259
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
 And then it's got a spider web on it,

260
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,300
 and you're like, "I hate this thing.

261
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,280
 "When's the iPhone 7 coming out?"

262
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,820
 We live in a world that's constantly saying,

263
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,960
 "If you will just get more, get more, get more,"

264
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
 especially as America.

265
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,440
 Like, we are so good at this,

266
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,220
 and we are so engaged in trying to get more,

267
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,720
 we don't even allow our stuff to be replaced anymore.

268
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,700
 We do something called upgrade.

269
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,020
 Have you ever thought about that?

270
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,260
 Like, nobody in this room, or most of us in this room,

271
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,380
 weren't like, "You know what happened?

272
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,180
 "I was using the iPhone 1,

273
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,880
 "and then it started disintegrating,

274
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,840
 "and so I moved up to the 6."

275
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,960
 We just go, "What, you're still on the 4?

276
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,380
 "You know, you can upgrade for free,

277
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,080
 "and by free, I mean $25 a month,

278
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,540
 "but you can still upgrade.

279
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,860
 "It's called Next."

280
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,740
 We don't even allow, we don't replace things anymore.

281
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,820
 We drive a car till it's 100,000 miles,

282
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,700
 and then we're like, "I think I should trade this in.

283
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,860
 "I'm not sure what to do with it beyond this."

284
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,060
 We don't even replace things like a TV.

285
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,640
 You're like, "There's an LED, this LCD.

286
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,820
 "This thing is worthless.

287
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,420
 "I need to upgrade."

288
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,100
 We no longer live in a world where we're like,

289
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,360
 "Oh, things need to be replaced."

290
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,220
 We're so good at getting more, and more, and more,

291
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,020
 and yet at the same time, if we were all honest,

292
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,840
 we're going, "It's not gonna bring

293
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,700
 "any more satisfaction in your life."

294
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
 And that's the Apostle Paul's point,

295
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,740
 that there is no relationship between contentment,

296
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,860
 between your standard of living, and your income,

297
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,540
 or the amount of stuff that you have.

298
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,480
 I mean, this is so huge.

299
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,180
 This means that right now, as much as I think all of us

300
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,160
 would go, "Man, I could really use more money.

301
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,340
 "I would like to make more money."

302
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,640
 The Apostle Paul says, "Your contentment in life,

303
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,860
 "your joy, your happiness, you could double

304
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,360
 "your salary right now, and you would still,

305
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,820
 "if you were discontent, find yourself discontent,

306
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,300
 "or find yourself wanting more."

307
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,140
 In other words, if you make $50,000,

308
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,140
 and we say, "Oh, tomorrow you make $100,000,"

309
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,940
 you will then just move everything up,

310
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,420
 and still find yourself wanting more,

311
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
 and more, and more, this appetite.

312
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,160
 And the Apostle Paul says, "Do not be fooled.

313
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,140
 "Gain, and great gain in this world

314
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,700
 "has nothing to do with money.

315
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,660
 "Contentment is not found in having money.

316
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,460
 "Don't buy the lie that the world around you

317
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,580
 "is trying to sell you."

318
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,260
 And he gives an indication further

319
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,780
 into a truth about money.

320
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,840
 He says this, "For we brought nothing into the world,

321
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,440
 "and we can take nothing out of it.

322
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,680
 "But if we have food and clothing,

323
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,580
 "we will be content with that."

324
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,880
 So the Apostle Paul says, "Look, you brought nothing

325
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,720
 "into this world."

326
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,780
 Here's the second idea about money.

327
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,820
 This is not our second point, first in this one,

328
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,100
 or just another idea within this passage,

329
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,180
 is he says, "Look, money, the idea of you bring nothing

330
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,920
 "into this world, and you take nothing out of it

331
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
 "means this, you are a steward.

332
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
 "You are not an owner.

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,440
 "Just like you came into this world with nothing,

334
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,760
 "you will die with nothing.

335
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,320
 "You cannot take anything with you.

336
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,240
 "Everything that you have is passing through your hands

337
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,820
 "like sand.

338
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,020
 "You do not own any of it.

339
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,060
 "You are a steward of all of it."

340
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,920
 And the Apostle Paul says, "Look, Steve Jobs,

341
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,660
 "right now, is worth zero.

342
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,060
 "If great gain is only about getting more and more

343
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,860
 "and more and more money, then at the end of our life,

344
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,940
 "there's no such thing as gain,

345
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,340
 "because you lose everything."

346
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,740
 And he says, "Look, we brought nothing in,

347
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,660
 "we'll take nothing out.

348
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,520
 "There is a gain, but it has nothing to do

349
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,380
 "with how much money you get."

350
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,620
 And while you're here on this earth,

351
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,880
 you are not an owner, you are a steward

352
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,620
 of every dollar that you have.

353
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,340
 It's all temporarily in your hands,

354
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,060
 and it's all leaving.

355
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,100
 And the Bible says, "For followers of Christ,

356
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,420
 "as a steward, you are a steward and not an owner."

357
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,040
 Which means every dollar that you have,

358
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,620
 you are stewarding, you're managing God's money.

359
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,480
 Now, why did we put money in the chairs

360
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,140
 of six people in this room,

361
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,200
 and I think six people in Fort Worth?

362
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,480
 To illustrate this point,

363
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,380
 those of you who got that money,

364
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,680
 if you have the $100, if you have the 20s,

365
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,060
 or if you have the 50, whatever amount that you got,

366
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,980
 we want you to use that money for a specific purpose,

367
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,020
 not on yourself, but on a kingdom investment.

368
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
 We want you to take that money,

369
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,820
 we want you to use it towards some organization

370
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
 that is Christ, for the cause of Christ, if you will,

371
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,340
 whether you're in Fort Worth or whether you're in Dallas.

372
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,540
 We're asking, do not use that money on yourself.

373
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,960
 We're saying, this is a kingdom investment.

374
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,600
 You are to steward this investment,

375
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,740
 you are not the owner of it, you are a steward of it.

376
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,940
 Now, everyone in the room that was jealous

377
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,500
 of not getting the $100 is a little less jealous.

378
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,320
 Have you noticed that?

379
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,060
 We're like, oh, they can't even use it on themselves.

380
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,660
 I don't care about that anymore.

381
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,160
 That's how we're to see all money.

382
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,440
 It's not yours, and it's not mine.

383
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
 That just like in that situation, like, oh, I get it,

384
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
 they don't even really get to use it for themselves,

385
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,740
 they're supposed to like steward it.

386
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,700
 That's how we're to see every dollar

387
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,420
 that passes through your hands and it passes through mine.

388
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,520
 And even the fact that there's a little bit of like,

389
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,740
 oh, I'm kind of sadder that I can't use this

390
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,300
 to make myself happier reflects the idea

391
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,220
 that we don't believe what Paul is saying is true.

392
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,500
 Money has nothing to do with contentment, with happiness.

393
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,220
 But he's about to lay out why contentment is not,

394
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,300
 or discontentment is not something to play with,

395
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,820
 but it is a danger that will destroy your life.

396
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,660
 And it is something that is a sin

397
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,220
 that leads you down a path like few other sins

398
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,300
 in scripture, especially in the language he's about to use

399
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,940
 as it says to this idea of getting more and more,

400
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,420
 aka greed, and how dangerous it is.

401
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,760
 Here's what he says.

402
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,920
 Verse nine, "Those who want to get rich,"

403
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,940
 not those who are rich,

404
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,620
 those who want, or the word long, strongly desire,

405
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,360
 those who lust after riches,

406
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,580
 those who want to live more richly,

407
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,500
 those who direct the course of their life to getting more,

408
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,340
 and to getting more, and to getting more,

409
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,460
 "they fall into temptation and a trap,

410
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,640
 "and into many foolish and harmful desires

411
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,060
 "that plunge people into ruin and destruction."

412
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,260
 I mean, look at the language he's using.

413
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,580
 The people who want to get rich, they fall into a trap,

414
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,540
 and they plunge themselves.

415
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,740
 They lead themselves into a situation

416
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,860
 of ruin and destruction.

417
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,900
 I think the two traps, and it's such a perfect word

418
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,540
 because a lot of us, I think, in the room,

419
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,380
 as we describe our financial situation, what do you feel?

420
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,100
 Trapped.

421
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,940
 Like I'm in a car where I'm upside down.

422
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,620
 I'm in a lease where I can't really afford it.

423
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,780
 I have to stay at this job right now

424
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,700
 because I cannot afford to leave

425
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,600
 because it would mean my standard of living

426
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,440
 would have to decrease.

427
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,460
 I'd have to get rid of the car.

428
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,380
 I'm trapped.

429
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,140
 And the apostle Paul says,

430
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,940
 "Look, you, like every other person in our world,

431
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,100
 "especially in America, is in danger.

432
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,340
 "If you do not have a hold on your discontent,

433
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,060
 "it will lead you down a path towards destruction."

434
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,800
 Our second idea is the danger of discontentment

435
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,340
 where the apostle Paul lays out it is a trap.

436
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,540
 I think the trap takes place in two different ways

437
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,980
 that we see described in Scripture.

438
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,420
 One trap that Scripture lays out as it relates to money

439
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,460
 is that the deceitfulness of money

440
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,140
 is that you never think you have enough.

441
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,100
 Like no matter how much you get, you're like,

442
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,300
 "Oh, I need a few more dollars.

443
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,100
 "I wish I could get a little bit richer."

444
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,260
 Ecclesiastes 5, the richest man ever,

445
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,100
 Solomon says this idea about,

446
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,060
 "Hey, whoever loves money will never have enough."

447
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,180
 John Rockefeller, who was worth 340 billion,

448
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,780
 he makes Bill Gates look like a beginner,

449
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,120
 340 billion was asked famously,

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,460
 "Hey, how much money would be enough for you?"

451
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,940
 One more dollar.

452
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,440
 Rich is a moving target.

453
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,860
 That's the danger of riches and pursuing riches

454
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,780
 because you are chasing a rabbit

455
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,260
 that will always remain in front of you

456
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,020
 no matter how far you run on the track.

457
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,940
 And the danger of riches

458
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,460
 is that they will never ever be enough, even today.

459
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,500
 Not long ago, this year, in May of this year,

460
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,360
 NBC put out a survey studying millionaires in our nation.

461
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,340
 People who made between one and $5 million,

462
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,740
 NBC surveyed a bunch of millionaires.

463
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,020
 These are multimillionaires.

464
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,280
 I make multimillion a year,

465
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,640
 and they asked them how they perceived themselves

466
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,180
 and how they looked at themselves.

467
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,100
 4% thought they were rich.

468
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,220
 In other words, if you make between one and $5 million,

469
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,900
 a multimillionaire, only 4%,

470
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,580
 the vast majority was like, "I'm middle class.

471
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,360
 "I'm a blue collar guy, just like you.

472
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,260
 "I mean, it's insane.

473
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,500
 "Think about that."

474
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,860
 But that's the deceitfulness of riches

475
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,880
 is you'll never have enough.

476
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,720
 You're gonna be in this trap,

477
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,300
 I need to make more, I need to make more.

478
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,300
 And then your lifestyle is gonna rise with that,

479
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,780
 so then you will be trapped into having to make more.

480
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,760
 That's the second idea,

481
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,500
 is really the trap of riches

482
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,460
 and the trap of pursuing to be riches

483
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,780
 is all of a sudden, not only is our income goes up,

484
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,900
 our standard of living will go up with it,

485
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,460
 and we put golden handcuffs on ourselves.

486
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,620
 And we end up finding men with incredible anxiety

487
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,460
 who make $300,000 a year, but they're going,

488
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,940
 "How am I gonna afford private school?

489
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,100
 "We got this yacht.

490
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,740
 "How am I gonna afford all these things?"

491
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,100
 And they put golden handcuffs on themselves

492
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,180
 and live a life filled with anxiety,

493
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,660
 filled with discontentment.

494
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,060
 And Paul says, "Look, if you allow this trap

495
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,380
 "to take you down the path of discontentment,

496
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,780
 "if you do not get a hold on this appetite

497
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,140
 "that is not relieved by feeding it more,

498
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,520
 "but by being controlled,"

499
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,420
 and we're gonna talk about how that takes place,

500
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,260
 "if you don't get a troll,

501
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,800
 "it will lead you down a path towards destruction

502
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 "and something even worse, for the love of money," Timothy.

503
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,020
 This is a very misquoted verse.

504
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,340
 For the love of money, not money.

505
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,780
 "Is the root of all kinds of evil."

506
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,180
 Not all evil.

507
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,620
 It's often quoted, money is the root of all evil.

508
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,900
 That is not in the Bible.

509
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,780
 For the love of money, the lust for more

510
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,220
 is the root of all kinds of evil.

511
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,920
 It's the reason many of you have parents who divorced.

512
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,780
 It's the reason much of the subprime mortgage,

513
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,420
 just circumstances that we found ourselves in in 2008

514
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,980
 and the catastrophe, and the catastrophe,

515
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,140
 and the catastrophe that took place after that took place.

516
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,660
 Greed, the love of money

517
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,340
 is the root of all kinds of evil,

518
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,640
 and some people, Timothy,

519
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,060
 and you can almost hear the emotion in his voice,

520
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,360
 "Eager for more money, have wandered away from the faith,

521
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,020
 "and they pierced themselves with many griefs."

522
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,460
 Some people, Timothy,

523
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,420
 they've taken just one step after the next,

524
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,940
 and all of a sudden, they've found themselves

525
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,380
 in a situation where they can't leave their job anymore,

526
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,180
 and they can't be a part of a local church anymore,

527
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,780
 they can't serve God anymore, they can't give anymore,

528
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,020
 because they've made decisions

529
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,900
 that have taken them down a financial path,

530
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,940
 and all of a sudden, it's led them even away

531
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,700
 from their own faith.

532
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,380
 I mean, think about that.

533
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,420
 How extreme is the language he's using here,

534
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,760
 where they've pierced themselves?

535
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,780
 When else does Paul talk like this?

536
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,620
 And he's saying, "Timothy, watch out.

537
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,680
 "The power of greed can lead you down a path

538
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,180
 "that is even away from God,

539
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,360
 "and you'll walk away from your faith

540
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,740
 "without even realizing the danger of discontentment."

541
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,380
 I know in this room, the trap has manifested itself

542
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,220
 in a lot of different ways.

543
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,080
 It's kept some of you in a job, where you're like,

544
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,900
 "Yeah, of course I have to keep working in iBanking,

545
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,520
 "because I have bills to pay, I have this car that I have,

546
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,920
 "I'm leasing a BMW, duh.

547
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,200
 "Of course I have to continue to work at this bar.

548
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,080
 "The tips are unbelievable.

549
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,500
 "Money has made this trap."

550
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,140
 Some of you are going, "I can't get married yet.

551
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,260
 "I'm gonna keep dating Beverly for the next seven years,

552
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,300
 "because I can't afford it.

553
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,260
 "I got all kinds of debt that are coming."

554
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,940
 Some of you are going, "I need to get married,

555
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,240
 "because I need a sugar mama

556
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,720
 "who can help pay down this debt,

557
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,540
 "and is driving all kinds of different decisions

558
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,560
 "in this room, especially as it relates to debt."

559
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,580
 Man, this is a side note, it's a tangent.

560
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,460
 Tangent.

561
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,080
 I know the averages for the debt amounts in this room

562
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
 as it relates to credit card and college loans

563
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
 are out of control.

564
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,200
 And some of you were fortunate enough to have parents

565
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
 who paid all the way through college,

566
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,000
 and others of you were not able to do that.

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,940
 But wherever you are in that spectrum,

568
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,720
 please use this season right now.

569
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,440
 If you are staring down the barrel of a lot of debt,

570
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,120
 you too, and for Oreth, to pay off that debt,

571
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,080
 that is something you do not wanna bring

572
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,640
 with you into marriage.

573
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,700
 You are gonna bring those financial problems,

574
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
 financial stresses into marriage,

575
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,720
 so do whatever you have to to begin to pay that down,

576
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,940
 hopefully get rid of it,

577
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,520
 but you do not wanna carry those things with you

578
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,560
 into marriage, where you have to go,

579
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,200
 "Oh yeah, look, I want you to meet my friend.

580
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
 "You heard of Master P?

581
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,020
 "Here's MasterCard, come on with me.

582
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,040
 "Here, I want you to meet my friend.

583
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,140
 "Not Lisa, this is Visa, and this is my $10,000 debt,

584
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,120
 "and I'm bringing it with me.

585
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,320
 "And here's the twins, called student loans,

586
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,560
 "and they're with me to stay too."

587
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,360
 Where you don't have to bring those things in

588
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,680
 and add anything else to the beginning of a marriage.

589
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,660
 Use this season, please use this season

590
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,760
 to begin to pay off that debt.

591
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,620
 Make cuts wherever you need to.

592
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,340
 A car, maybe you gotta downgrade from the 4Runner

593
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,940
 and just get a Corolla.

594
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,740
 I don't know, Corollas are great.

595
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,380
 Downgrade from the, and 4Runners are great too,

596
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,540
 but do whatever you have to to financially

597
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,580
 set yourself in a place where you can pursue oneness,

598
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,260
 pursue marriage, and be on the right step towards that,

599
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,380
 and be ready for when God brings that right person

600
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
 or right someone along.

601
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,880
 All right, here we go, keep going.

602
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,140
 The cure for discontentment.

603
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,340
 So Paul lays out, he's saying,

604
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,720
 "Look, there's a danger in discontentment.

605
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,700
 "It will lead you astray.

606
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,160
 "It can even lead you away from God,

607
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,580
 "but there is a cure, Timothy,

608
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,900
 "and I want you to know about it."

609
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,060
 And Paul's life really models the cure

610
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,560
 as well as anyone that I know.

611
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,900
 And he says this in verse 11.

612
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,300
 "But you, O man of God," as we explore the third point,

613
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,800
 "the cure for discontentment is Christ."

614
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,620
 The cure for discontentment is Christ.

615
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,620
 "But you," verse 11, "man of God, flee from all of this."

616
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,040
 What is all of this?

617
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,400
 Materialism, the desire for more,

618
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,560
 the fact that, yes, of course I have to have an iPhone,

619
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,320
 of course I have to drive this kind of car,

620
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,720
 of course I have to live in this area,

621
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,000
 of course I have to get newer clothes.

622
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Hey, flee from all of that.

623
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,400
 There's only two times, his language is so extreme

624
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,280
 in this passage, two times the apostle Paul

625
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,640
 talks about fleeing something.

626
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,060
 One of them is sexuality.

627
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,520
 And I think a lot of us are going,

628
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
 yes, I wanna be on guard, I'm at least aware of the fact

629
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
 that I should flee from this.

630
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,720
 And the other place he talks about it is right here

631
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
 where he says, look, flee materialism.

632
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,600
 It's gonna suck you down a culture,

633
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
 you're gonna step onto a path that will not end

634
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,680
 until it has destroyed you, destroyed your future,

635
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,160
 and destroyed even your faith.

636
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
 And the fact that you don't believe me

637
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,480
 is just a testament to the fact

638
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,280
 that you may be moving in that direction.

639
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,800
 He says, look, greed, like very few other things,

640
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,340
 Timothy, flee.

641
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,040
 Don't be careful with it.

642
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,420
 Don't get in the cage with a lion

643
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,320
 and say, I'm just gonna be careful in here.

644
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,880
 He says, when it comes to the topic of greed and money,

645
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,720
 flee from it, run in the opposite direction,

646
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,680
 in this direction, and pursue righteousness,

647
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.

648
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,200
 I think personally this week, I was like so convicted

649
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,520
 because I, like you, live in Dallas

650
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,440
 in a culture where we are constantly being pushed

651
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,620
 towards keeping up with the Joneses,

652
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,540
 keeping up with making more, dressing a certain way,

653
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,340
 having a certain amount, living in a certain neighborhood,

654
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,120
 buying a home by a certain age.

655
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,780
 And all around me, I can feel this pressure

656
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,260
 to have more and more, and I need more and more and more,

657
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,820
 and I feel this inside of my heart.

658
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,660
 And I think I came in to even studying for this message

659
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,600
 very aware that, hey, I'm a pervert as it relates to lust.

660
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,580
 I need covenant eyes on everything I own.

661
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,640
 I know my temptations is gonna be to long after someone

662
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
 who's not my wife, so I wanna make sure I keep that

663
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,360
 in front of my community, I keep that in check.

664
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,280
 I'm very much, I wanna flee from that.

665
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,360
 And I don't think that I do this,

666
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,920
 where I flee from materialism,

667
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 like the scripture calls me to.

668
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,920
 And even in the shows that I watch and just navigating,

669
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,320
 what am I feeding my heart?

670
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,840
 We just did a remodel in a home.

671
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
 One of our favorite shows is Fixer Upper.

672
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,000
 And even watching that, I was like, oh my gosh,

673
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,700
 I continue to feel this desire for more and more,

674
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,660
 like I'm feeding this discontent.

675
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,660
 And being convicted of like, Lord,

676
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,060
 what am I feeding my heart?

677
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,860
 How am I being led and deceived down this path?

678
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,300
 Will you help me to experience the cure

679
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,100
 for that discontentment which is found in Christ alone,

680
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,760
 which is why he tells Timothy,

681
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,500
 look, don't just run away from it.

682
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,740
 Don't just be intentional about what you're feeding

683
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,060
 your heart, who you're surrounding yourself with,

684
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,820
 how you're spending.

685
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,560
 I want you to pursue faithfulness, things of the faith.

686
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,040
 I want you to pursue Christ.

687
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,360
 And here's what I think Paul knew.

688
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,280
 And I'll close with just talking a little bit

689
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,560
 about Paul's life and then about this true treasure

690
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,800
 that the scriptures reveal that Paul knew of,

691
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 which is Christ.

692
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,720
 Paul, who instructs Timothy,

693
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
 I want you to run after faithfulness.

694
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,800
 I want you to run after faith, love,

695
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,900
 endurance, righteousness.

696
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,840
 I want you to run after all of these qualities

697
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,640
 that are found in your faith, found in Christ.

698
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,020
 I think Paul knew that when you do that, Timothy,

699
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,720
 if that's the pursuit of your life,

700
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,700
 in other words, you could just insert for all of those,

701
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,760
 pursue after Christ.

702
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,120
 When you do that, Timothy, what you will discover

703
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,320
 is he is the greatest treasure of this life.

704
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,880
 Your hands will all of a sudden be opened up

705
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,960
 because you're encountering the greatest treasure,

706
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
 the truest treasure.

707
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,680
 In other words, the cure for contentment

708
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,240
 and the cure for discontentment in your life and mine

709
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,160
 is not just me saying like, look, be fine with what you have.

710
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,840
 You got great treasures, you should like 'em,

711
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,200
 hold on to 'em, but it's finding

712
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,780
 a superior treasure in Christ.

713
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,940
 Like, what other hope do we have

714
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,600
 as it relates to discontentment?

715
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,400
 Really, and we're just gonna like, oh, I'm fine,

716
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,280
 I don't want anymore.

717
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,760
 We live in a city, we live in a world

718
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,560
 that's gonna constantly push us to the edge,

719
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,080
 and Christ and all of that, the only remedy

720
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,480
 for the cure of discontentment

721
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,500
 or to find a cure for discontentment

722
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,480
 is to find the superior treasure,

723
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
 the truest treasure, who is Christ.

724
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,900
 And Paul instructs Timothy, look, run after this,

725
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,240
 and you will discover the one

726
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
 who is worth giving everything up,

727
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
 the one who makes every other earthly treasure

728
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,040
 look so small, the one where true life is found,

729
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,600
 the one who Paul says about in Philippians 3

730
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,560
 as it relates to everything in his world,

731
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,880
 he says this about Christ, that knowing him,

732
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,720
 knowing the true treasure that's Jesus

733
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,960
 has broken the chains of discontentment

734
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,820
 in Paul's life, and he says this, verse eight

735
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,980
 of chapter three in Philippians.

736
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,980
 I consider everything loss because of the surpassing worth

737
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,060
 of knowing Christ, Jesus my Lord,

738
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,580
 for whose sake I have lost everything.

739
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
 Paul, you lost everything, I lost my house,

740
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,380
 I lost my job, I lost my income, I lost everything.

741
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,480
 Man, Paul, that must be rough.

742
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,020
 Not for me, I consider them garbage

743
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,820
 that I may gain Christ and be found in him,

744
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,460
 not having a righteousness of my own

745
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,800
 that comes from the law, but that which is through faith

746
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,180
 in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God

747
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,240
 on the basis of faith.

748
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,700
 I wanna know Christ.

749
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,820
 Yes, to know the power of his resurrection,

750
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,520
 to participate in his sufferings,

751
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
 become like him in his death, and so attaining

752
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,840
 the resurrection of the dead.

753
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,000
 Paul says, look, I've lost everything,

754
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,320
 and I don't even care about it.

755
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,040
 It's all garbage, or the word dung.

756
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,000
 It's all trash to me.

757
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,880
 I've lost it all, and I don't care

758
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
 because the greatest thing in my life

759
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
 is the truest treasure.

760
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,320
 Every other treasure shrunk and became so small

761
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,120
 in comparison to knowing Christ.

762
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,060
 And I read that, and I'm like you,

763
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,240
 and maybe you're someone who's like,

764
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,920
 oh, dude, I am Amish, and I don't have anything.

765
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,880
 I live in this city, and that feels so far from me.

766
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,740
 And I want that to be the story of my life

767
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,200
 where I go, look, everything, God,

768
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,960
 I want it to all shrink away

769
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,360
 compared to the truest treasure, which is Jesus.

770
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,300
 I don't wanna spend my life chasing little trinkets.

771
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,560
 When am I gonna get a newer car?

772
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,000
 I drive a 2004 Tahoe.

773
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,840
 I don't wanna spend it going, when can I upgrade

774
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
 on Craigslist to the 2010?

775
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I wanna spend my life pursuing Jesus,

776
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,700
 and the only way that I know how to get there

777
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,480
 is by looking at what the apostle Paul says

778
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,200
 made it happen to him, is when he began to discover

779
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,920
 through knowing Christ, I can see that Jesus

780
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,880
 is the greatest treasure, the truest treasure,

781
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,120
 the treasure of all existence,

782
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,600
 the treasure that we're gonna worship

783
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
 for all of existence, for all of eternity,

784
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,040
 and the thing that will free your hands up

785
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,060
 from your greed, the thing that will allow you

786
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,640
 to be generous is not by just going,

787
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,440
 I'm gonna try harder, and I'm gonna feel guilty,

788
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,740
 but by knowing Christ and in knowing him,

789
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,080
 you see the truest treasure, the greatest treasure.

790
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,040
 Even the story that we find of this idea

791
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,040
 of treasure in heaven, when you read in Revelation 21,

792
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,680
 and I'm gonna close right here,

793
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,360
 when you read in Revelation 21, and John,

794
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,520
 the apostle John, who was one of Jesus' best friend,

795
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,660
 he writes about heaven, and he begins to describe

796
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,580
 what heaven's like, and even the terms

797
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,940
 and the materials that make up heaven,

798
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,720
 the things that are used for building materials,

799
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,260
 the things for asphalt, it's like he uses

800
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,080
 everything that we value in this world.

801
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,520
 He looks around, and he says, look,

802
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,220
 the streets, it's like they're made of gold.

803
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,280
 The sheet rock up there, it's pearls and emeralds

804
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,600
 and all these different diamonds

805
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,400
 and all these different jewels,

806
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,320
 and he says, everywhere that you look around,

807
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,740
 and he begins to tell out as though

808
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,620
 he's sending us a message that the things

809
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,500
 that we value in this life, the things

810
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,960
 that we think are so valuable,

811
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,280
 especially his audience would have in the first century,

812
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,600
 emeralds, he says, yeah, gold, yeah,

813
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,260
 it's like when you get there, they're asphalt,

814
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,240
 they're nothing, all the things you treasure

815
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,540
 in this life, when you get to heaven,

816
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,540
 one day we're all gonna see all these earthly treasures

817
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,440
 are pushed aside to make way for the treasure

818
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,420
 of the ages, whose name is Jesus,

819
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,800
 and in this life, the thing that will free you and I up

820
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,160
 from discontentment, from wanting more treasure,

821
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 is knowing the truest treasure,

822
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,820
 the treasure of all life,

823
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,780
 and as I wrestled with even just this message

824
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,240
 and we were going, hey, we wanna cover money,

825
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,380
 we wanna cover how we can steward God's resources,

826
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,420
 and we think all of you should,

827
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,280
 what's gonna change your discontentment,

828
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,800
 and this is a huge epidemic in our city,

829
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,000
 in my heart, and I know in this room,

830
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,180
 what's gonna change your heart

831
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,960
 is not gonna be some message on money,

832
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,880
 it's gonna be encountering Jesus and seeing him.

833
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,720
 The Bible even says that's how we're changed,

834
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,960
 is when we're introduced to the truest treasure,

835
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
 and the apostle Paul writes and he says,

836
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,280
 look, I have found it, and in another place he says,

837
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,280
 I know the secret of being content, and it's Jesus.

838
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,100
 I know the secret of being generous, and it's Jesus.

839
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,940
 And the remedy for your greed and for mine is him, is him.

840
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,980
 As we just explore this topic of money,

841
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,140
 we know there are people all across the board

842
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,740
 on the spectrum of finances,

843
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,340
 and some of you feel in a place

844
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,340
 where you're going, I feel trapped.

845
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,100
 We would love to talk with you more,

846
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,580
 but there is a class that I think everyone in this room

847
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,140
 should take called Money Wise,

848
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,540
 where as you walk through finances,

849
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,900
 you don't have to do it alone,

850
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,500
 you don't even have to do it just for your community,

851
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,660
 we'd encourage you, but you can have financial counselors

852
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,860
 who come around, equip and care for.

853
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,820
 And we think everyone should give.

854
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,580
 If you were given that money, please give,

855
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,860
 do not give it here, give it to some kingdom-minded

856
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
 organization, and we hope you're generous,

857
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,900
 but more than any of that,

858
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,900
 we think that the right path to step onto,

859
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,540
 the thing that will break the chains of discontentment,

860
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,300
 break the golden handcuffs,

861
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,140
 is gonna be knowing the true treasure.

862
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,420
 And if you know him and you're pursuing him,

863
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,740
 everything else will fall into place.

864
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,220
 Well, David, how much should I give?

865
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,140
 What does it look like to steward really well?

866
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,740
 If you're pursuing the true treasure,

867
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,660
 it'll work itself out.

868
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,660
 Be generous, as you reflect the God who you worship

869
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,180
 who's generous, generous enough to even give his son,

870
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,940
 but it's him, it's Jesus.

871
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,420
 And this whole message of money is just to showcase,

872
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,900
 it's just to showcase and show him.

873
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,460
 He's the remedy for our discontentment.

874
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,180
 He's the one who can bring change.

875
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,900
 He's the one that Paul says,

876
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,740
 "Everything else I push aside with ease,"

877
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,700
 just to know him.

878
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,580
 I'm gonna pray that we would.

879
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,420
 Let me pray.

880
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,240
 Father, thank you.

881
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,380
 For some of us, you have introduced us already

882
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,400
 to the true treasure, our Savior.

883
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,220
 I pray that, Lord, I wanna treasure Jesus.

884
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,620
 I wanna say with Paul that everything else is a loss

885
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,900
 compared to knowing you.

886
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:43,240
 Would you help us, Lord, we're so easily distracted.

887
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,380
 Would you help us to know, pursue, step onto that path

888
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,340
 of seeing Jesus as the true treasure,

889
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,500
 the treasure that one day we will see

890
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,780
 he's always been the most valuable thing.

891
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,720
 He'll always be the most valuable thing.

892
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,460
 I pray that that would take place before we go to heaven

893
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,260
 or even the building materials testify,

894
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,780
 you're the treasure, you're the king.

895
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,740
 We worship you now.

896
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,180
 Would you convince us of that reality

897
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,900
 that you are our treasure?
