00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 How we doing on porch?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 [Cheering]

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Come on baby.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Come on, we're back.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Fantasy series.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 We're making it happen.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I don't know what you said.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 But you're distracting me.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Trying to preach up here.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Oh man, this Saturday.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm in bed, like it's, you know, we're sleeping in on Saturday.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And my phone rings like 7.20 a.m.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 And it's a buddy of mine.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 He's got some daughters, you know, I've got two daughters.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And one of our oldest are the same age.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And I'm like, what's he doing calling at 7.20 in the morning on a Saturday?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Like, brother's sleeping.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And so I answer the phone and he's like, hey, here's what's going to happen.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I'm like, okay, I'm listening.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 He goes, I'm at 9.30.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I'm going to pick you up in a Bentley GT Continental.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We're going to drive to the Addison Airport.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We're going to take a private jet to San Antonio.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I got a limo waiting for us there.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I got a limo waiting for us there.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And we're going to take that to the Riverwalk.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 We're going to go eat lunch.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We're going to take our daughters, our oldest daughters, same age, and we're going to eat lunch.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And then we'll take the limo back.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I'm going to have you back home by 2.30 in the afternoon.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And I'm like, dude, I thought I was watching soccer games today.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Wow, I had no idea.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I didn't know this was going to happen, you know.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And so just in case you were with us last week, had a nice car on stage.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Like private jets are not normal for me.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Like I can count on one finger the number of times I've been on a private jet.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And so we go and we do this, right.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And we go over there to San Antonio.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And then we go to the Riverwalk.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We go to the Alamo.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Remember the Alamo?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And then right across the street from the Alamo is this tourist trap, right.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's like Ripley's Believe It or Not.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 You know, Ripley, you guys have seen it.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 World Record Museum, something or other.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And then there's this like roller coaster, this indoor roller coaster called Tomb Raider 3D.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Not Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 3D.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And so, you know, I'm like, hey, let's do that.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm up there, I'm buying tickets.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 But then our daughters are like, wait, wait a minute, hold on.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And they're like looking inside.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 They're trying to, you know, because it's something with like you get guns and shoot zombies or something.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Hey, like what's going to happen in there?

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And they're trying to peek in.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And then one of them's like, hey, I'm not going on that unless I know what it's going to be like.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I need to know what to expect.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And so I start there, right.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I'm going to pick up that story in a minute.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 But I start there because I think that's what's happening with marriage, right.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We're getting married later.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 We're getting married less.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 We're getting divorced more.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And I think we're looking out.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I remember, like, look, I'm married now.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I get it.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I get it.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 You know, what do I know about singleness?

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 You forget.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I was single, right.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I remember kind of standing out here, like, looking like, okay, do I want to do this?

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I don't know.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Kind of dip my toe in the water.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Like, are we sure?

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Is it forever, ever, forever, ever, ever?

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 You know, and so, and so you kind of look at it.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 You're like, well, I don't know what to expect.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Like, unless I know what to expect, I'm not going to move that direction.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 It's interesting because what I did is I said, okay, hold on.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Let me go talk to the guy.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I'll go talk to the roller coaster guy.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I go up.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I'm like, Mr. Roller Coaster Guy, can you tell me exactly what to expect?

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Like, how fast does it go?

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Do things jump out at you?

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Like, what exactly are we shooting?

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And he just, he rolls out the blueprint for the whole ride.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He's like, this is what's going to happen, you know, and he tells me.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And so I sit them down.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I'm like, hey, you know, here's what's going to happen.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And they listen, right.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 We get on it.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And we go through the ride.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 It lasts about five minutes, just like he said it would.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 We get off.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And they say, man, that's nothing like we expected.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And I'm like, well, that's confusing because I told you exactly what to expect.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And they're like, yeah, you did.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And it was all the things you said and nothing like we expected.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And I'm like, so you don't trust me, you know.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And so here's why I say that because that's what it's been like to teach about marriage for 10 years.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I mean, I've done probably 20-plus weddings.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I've sat down in my living room, my wife and I, with 20-plus couples.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I said, hey, this is what you're going to.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Hey, this is what it's going to be like.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 This is what God says about it.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I know you think you're going to be the exception.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 You're not going to be the exception.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And then they get in it, right.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And then they call me six months.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 They call me five years.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 They call me later.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And they say, man, it's so different than we expected.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 But it's exactly what you said it was, but so different than what we expected.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And so I want to help you.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I want to help you tonight.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I'm going to tell you this evening what to expect in marriage, a biblical view of marriage.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I'm going to be in Ephesians chapter 5, the last part of that chapter there.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It's all about marriage.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I'm going to give you a picture of it.

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 We're in this fantasy series talking about finding real love in a fake world.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Here's what a fake world means.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 With social media telling you, hey, this is what marriage is like.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 With, you know, with magazines, airbrushing, this is what marriage is like.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Movies and TV shows saying, hey, this is what marriage is like.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Tinder and dating apps saying this is how you're married.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'm going back to the one who invented marriage.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Like he made it.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 It's his idea.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Why?

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Why would God, the creator, come up with this idea of marriage?

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 What was he doing?

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 What was he thinking?

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 What does he want from us?

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 It's going to be different than you think.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And as much as I'm able, I want to help you know what to expect so that when you go in there

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 and you bump up against these things, you're like, oh, man, he prepared me for this.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 God was so gracious and kind that his word prepared me for this, right?

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And so as we think about the fantasy marriage, we think about finding the one, our soulmate.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 We think about love at first sight.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 We think about trying to live happily ever after.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 We're looking for compatibility.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And what I would tell you is there is no compatibility between sinners.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And guess what you are?

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 You're a sinner.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And so there's no-- and I know you're like, no, no, no, my boyfriend and I, we have great compatibility.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Yeah, just like your last boyfriend, great compatibility.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 You know?

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Oh, wow.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I didn't mean to hurt you.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I'm just saying I know you think you're compatible today.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Like call me a couple years into marriage and tell me how that compatibility-- I liken it like this, you know?

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It's like oil and water.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Like it doesn't mix.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And what happens is when we get married, like these two substances, they will not mix together.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And when we get married, it's like we try to mix it up, you know?

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And everybody comes and there's-- oh, it's leaking a little bit.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And there's, you know, a white dress and cake.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And they come and they're like, oh, man, it looks like it's mixed.

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 They go so well together, those two.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So beautiful, so well mixed together.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But it doesn't stay that way.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 It slowly over time, when the feels, all the feels go away, it slowly separates back to something that is not compatible.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So you have to have something else working toward your favor in this, right?

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And I'm really compassionate toward you.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Girls, I know since you were four years old, man, you've been reading the Disney stories.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 You were a Disney princess for Halloween, right?

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And you've been looking for your happily ever after Prince Charming,

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 someone that's going to bring the glass slipper that fits perfect and take you off in a carriage forever and ever to his palace.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I get that.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And guys, since the fifth grade, you've been looking for someone to live out all your crazy sexual fantasies and clean your room.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And I know that. No, I get it, man.

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 I understand.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And I'm just telling you, it's not like that.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Those expectations are setting you up for major failure.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And I know that our expectations are off because, you know, every couple, when I do their wedding, I have them take this test, this prepare and enrich test.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 That's not like pass or fail. It just shows us what to work on.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And they miss these questions. All of them, I believe all of them have missed these questions or at least most of them.

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It says, "My partner will meet all my needs for companionship."

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And they say, "True, it's false."

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 "My partner's interest in sex will be the same as mine."

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 They say, "True, it's false."

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 They say, "Nothing could cause us," this is a big one, "Everyone is missing."

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 "Nothing could cause me to question our love for one another."

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I got to tell you something, you're going to be questioning your love for one another before you get back from the honeymoon.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Like that's the truth.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 You can't go in there with these rose-colored glasses because you're going to be thinking, "Man, did I marry the wrong one? Is this really working? What did I do?"

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I believe I know everything there is to know about my partner.

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 They said, "True, it's false."

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And so as we move through this series, we talked about what love really is.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 We talked about what to look for in a woman, what to look for in a man.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Tonight we're talking about what you are actually looking for in marriage.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 If you want to be married, this is what I want you to know.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I want you to be married.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Like if you desire marriage, then I desire marriage for you.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I want to help you get there, and it's a good thing.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And I hope that you desire marriage.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I'm going to show you tonight, you have two options.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It's marriage or singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 There's no other options.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So you either want to be married or you want to serve Christ with your life, with reckless abandon, with all that you can.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 You want to leverage your singleness for Him.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 We did a great message on singleness.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 You can go search it, singleness.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 I'd encourage you to on the porch.live or watermark.org, and it is there for your learning, for your consumption.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 But if you desire marriage, I want you to get married.

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 That's what I hope happens.

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I hope this is a space maker message.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Not because I scare you off, but because you get married and have babies and stop coming.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I hope that's what God does tonight.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And so we're talking about fantasy marriage, what to expect.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And as we move through Ephesians 5, 21 through 33, we're going to talk about how to expect sacrifice and expect to sacrifice and submit.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Expect to be sanctified through service and expect that it is all about your Savior.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Not about you, but all about your Savior.

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Let's dive in verse 21.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 You want a picture of marriage?

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 We can't get one line into marriage without talking about Christ, without talking about Jesus.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body of which he is the Savior.

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 You can underline submit there.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's said a few times, all right, we can't get away from this.

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Like you might be thinking, man, the Apostle Paul just kind of went crazy here and that's not biblical.

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 The Holy Spirit took his hands off the wheel and that shouldn't be in the Bible.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Except for it says in 1 Peter 3, verse 1, wives in the same way, submit yourselves to your own husbands.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 In Colossians 3, verse 18, wives submit yourselves to your husbands as fitting to the Lord.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So it seems like God means this, like he's serious.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 But let me bring some clarity to this because it doesn't say women submit to men.

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And it doesn't say women submit to sin.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And so if a man is asking you to sin, don't submit to him.

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 That even rhymes for you, okay?

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 So do not submit to any man who's asking you to sin.

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 You submit to the Lord.

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It's not saying submit to your boyfriend.

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 If your boyfriend's coming at you, quoting to you from Ephesians, I'd peace out on that, okay?

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So that's not what this is saying.

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 It's saying wives submit to your husbands.

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Which is, you know, you can say it's outdated.

242
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 You can say, hey, that's old school.

243
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 The Greek, I've studied it.

244
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That's not really what it means.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 You'd be wrong.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Now, let me show you something else, though.

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Stay put.

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I see your scowl.

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Calm down, ladies.

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Verse 25, husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Now, if we were to say in a word what that's saying husbands should do,

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 the best word that I can come up with is this word, sacrifice your life.

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Now, those are two really big asks.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Wives, submit to your husbands.

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 That's a big ask.

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 It's a tall order.

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I'll give you that all day.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And then it says husbands, sacrifice your lives for your wives.

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 That's a tall ask, too.

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I might argue that's a bigger ask, like give up everything for her.

261
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And I would tell you, ladies, if he did that, submitting to his leadership wouldn't be any problem at all.

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 So you want to say I do to a guy that you're confident is going to do that,

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 that he's willing to sacrifice his life for you.

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And so in like our fantasy ideas, we think, you know, find the one or find our soulmate.

265
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 But the mandates of marriage is sacrifice and submission.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 My first point, the mandates of marriage is sacrifice and submission.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 We think, you know, it's like, OK, the mandate of marriage is to find my soulmate and see the world.

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But the Scripture says, no, it's sacrifice and submission.

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And really what Paul is doing here is he's nodding his head at a metaphor of marriage, that it is all about Jesus,

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 that we cannot talk about this text without understanding fully what that is.

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And it's going to be different than what you think.

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It's going to be bigger and grander and more amazing, incredible and more important than you could have ever thought.

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And in fact, Christ is our example.

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 When we think about submission. When we think about sacrifice, Jesus is what we look to to learn how to do that.

275
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 In Philippians chapter two, it says that Jesus, who being in the very nature of God,

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage,

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 but instead he considered himself nothing, became like a servant and sacrificed his life according to the father's will.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 He gave up everything.

279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And so what is the ask of you when you think about marriage?

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It's give 100 percent and expect minimal in return.

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And let's just agree that's extremely difficult.

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 How does anybody do that?

283
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And as you're thinking about, well, are they someone that I might spend the rest of my life with?

284
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I would ask you, how do they submit to authority?

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 How do they deal with this? Are they like do they have a chip on their shoulder like their way or the highway?

286
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 They think they know it all. Pride marks them.

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Are they ready to come under an authority? I'm talking men and women.

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Because we can't forget it says submit to each other.

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 This is a two way street.

290
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Out of your reverence for Christ.

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Submit to each other.

292
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And so how do they do that? This is an important idea to think through when you're considering who you might spend the rest of your life with.

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And so what I would tell you is to stop looking for the one.

294
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 You're not looking for the one. You're looking for someone.

295
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Who has submitted their lives to the one. Capital T. Capital O.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 I know we're looking for our soul mate. Someone perfect for us.

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 You find someone and let God make them the one.

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 There is no one. You've got to understand this. There's not a one.

299
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 That's a bad idea. It's a bad theology.

300
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And I've said this. I've taught this through the years. There's lots of dating messages on our app.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You can go back and listen to all of them.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 But to try to say this in a new way, let me just say it's mathematically impossible.

303
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 There are 66 million more men in the world than women.

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 66 million. That's a huge number.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Ladies I just heard your heart break.

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 It's a depressing stat. I get it.

307
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It's going to be okay though, right?

308
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Because you're not looking for just anyone. You're not looking for the one.

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 You're looking for the one who's already submitted his life to the one.

310
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Who knows Christ and is living for Christ.

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Not a soul mate, but a S-O-L-E mate.

312
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 One mate. A singular mate.

313
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So not a soul mate, but a soul mate. S-O-L-E mate.

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And so that's who you're trying to find in this idea.

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And the good news is, is there's all kinds of people that you can make that work with.

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And in fact, whoever you marry, this is what I want you to know,

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 whoever you marry, there will be someone better suited for you than them out there in the world.

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 You need to know that.

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 So that's kind of like hitting the pressure release valve.

320
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Take a deep breath. I don't have to find the perfect person.

321
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I just have to find someone who knows the one who is perfect.

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And is pursuing them and who they're going to make the perfect person.

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 This is good news, right?

324
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You say, "Well, how do I train for that?"

325
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 You know, sacrifice and submission.

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Have roommates.

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I encourage all my single friends, have roommates.

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I'd get the dysfunctional kind if I were you.

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 That will help you for marriage, okay?

330
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Get the ones that don't do the dishes, you know?

331
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 That will help you and prepare you for marriage.

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And if you're here and you're thinking, "Man, I just don't know if I'm up for..."

333
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 You think I'm kidding, by the way, I'm not.

334
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I've been saying that for 10 years now. I stand by it.

335
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 People have come back and thanked me for that.

336
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Okay, if you live alone, I wouldn't.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Alright, if you're like, "Well, I just like to live alone."

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You're going to hate marriage because there's someone always there, like right beside you, like a shadow, man.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And so, I would get roommates.

340
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I mean, that's great training.

341
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I would serve. I would look for opportunities to put your own selfish desires aside.

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 To think about, "Hey, how can you sacrifice your desires for somebody else?"

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And if you don't want to be married, if you're like here and you're like, "Well, I don't want to be married."

344
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I just, I want to present that other option to you one more time.

345
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 The other option the scripture gives you is in Matthew 19, it's to be single for the sake of the kingdom.

346
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Not to sow your wild oats, to see the world, you know, to see how many shots you can take before you pass out.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Like, that's being single in the wrong way.

348
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And it's a dishonoring to the one who created you and gave you a purpose.

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 You're living outside your purpose and it's going to leave you despairing.

350
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 It's going to leave you really sad and depressed.

351
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I don't want that for you.

352
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 So, you can be single so that you can go and take the gospel as many places as possible and build the kingdom.

353
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Or you can get married.

354
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And if you're single, live radically sold out for Jesus.

355
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 That's really your only option.

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Live for the one who created you.

357
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And I would just tell you in this idea of sacrifice and submission, like I can do anything in a moment.

358
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I can write a love song.

359
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I can write poetry, say, tell you how beautiful you are.

360
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I can even take out the trash for a minute, right?

361
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 But to do that every single day of my life, over and over and over, that's what you're trying to find out.

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Are they up for that?

363
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Are they consistent?

364
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Are they sustaining?

365
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 This is what God, this is how God loves us.

366
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It's in a sustainable, constant, ongoing, forever kind of way.

367
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And marriage is a metaphor showing the world His love.

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And so that's how we love each other in marriage.

369
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 My wife and I, we disagree on a lot of things, challenges in marriage.

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And so one of those things through the years has been a big point of contention has been pets.

371
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 So we haven't had any because I think they're pets and she thinks they're people.

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And so we just have avoided that.

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But I'm reading Ephesians 5.

374
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 You know, I'm supposed to like love her as Christ loved the church.

375
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And I'm like, I think that means get a dog.

376
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 And so I did.

377
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And primarily motivated too, in addition to that, motivated because my daughter was like,

378
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 you know, I just want a puppy, Daddy, I want a puppy.

379
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And all right, so we got a puppy and I even let her inside.

380
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And I know, because that's what Jesus would do.

381
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And so it's like I tell my daughter Finley, who just loves this puppy so much, wanted her so much, you know.

382
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And I say, hey, you never have to wonder if I love you.

383
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 If you ever ask for a second, like, does Daddy really love me?

384
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 You just look at that puppy.

385
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Because that is me laying my life down for you.

386
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And it's like God says to you, hey, you don't ever have to wonder if I love you.

387
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And we wonder sometimes, right?

388
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 When things get hard, we start to question, God, do you really love me?

389
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I think that breaks us hard.

390
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But you don't ever have to wonder if God loves you.

391
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 It's like he's saying to you, hey, if you ever wonder if I love you, you just look at the cross.

392
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 That's where I allowed my son to die on behalf of you, to purchase you to myself so that I can spend forever with you.

393
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 I paid the ultimate price.

394
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And so you think about how permanent that is, that you've been sealed by his Holy Spirit,

395
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 that he gave up what was most precious to him to display his love for you forever.

396
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Verse 26, talking about Christ and the church, it says,

397
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 "To make her holy," that word, "to make her holy" or "to make holy" is a word, "sanctification."

398
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 If you ever hear that's a Christian word, "sanctification" just means to make holy.

399
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 "To make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,

400
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.

401
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 In this same way, husbands," so he's talking about Christ and the church, and then he goes,

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 "In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.

403
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body,

404
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 but they feed and care for their body just as Christ does the church, for we are members of his body."

405
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And so he's going, "Marriage and Jesus and the church and marriage and Jesus,

406
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 wives and husbands, Jesus and the church, wives and husbands, Jesus and the church."

407
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He's just going back and forth, weaving it together, giving you a clue.

408
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Hey, there's something more to marriage than you think there is.

409
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Stop listening to Cosmo or Esquire or ETV or MTV or The Bachelor

410
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 because there's something more to marriage than you think.

411
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 It's bigger than you think.

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And when he says, "Cleansing her by the washing with water through the Word,"

413
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 he's not talking about baptism. He's talking about how the Word of God purifies us.

414
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 That when we read the Scripture, maybe you think it's pointless to move through the Bible,

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 but it's not pointless because the Holy Spirit is doing something through the Word of God.

416
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 He's cleansing you.

417
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And so as I lead my family, one of the ways that I need to lead my family

418
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 is to make sure that we are on the regular getting into the Word of God.

419
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And so if you're here and you're asking, "Hey, am I marriage material? Am I marriage material?"

420
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I got one really simple quiz question for you.

421
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Did you spend time in God's Word today?

422
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Were you cleansed by the washing as though through the Word of God today?

423
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Did that happen? And yesterday and tomorrow?

424
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 And that's just a simple step that you can take to prepare you for whatever is next and for this day.

425
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Let a day go by, not in a form of legalism, but in a form of adoration and worship.

426
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Spend time in God's Word.

427
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 "Man, but it doesn't make sense, and I daydream, and I just don't get it. It's a big Word."

428
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 It's okay. Just read the Word. Get a commentary. Take your time. Go verse at a time.

429
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 There's never been more resources in the history of the world than right now to help you.

430
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And that's on the Internet. It's amazing.

431
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And so the fantasy for us is we want to live happily ever after,

432
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 and have our own little play partner, our own little live-in handyman to fix things.

433
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I think girls think that marriage is like one long conversation, just one never-ending,

434
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 "Me too, me too. Let me tell you about my day. Really, my life."

435
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And guys think it's like one big sexual escapade.

436
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 There's some blend of both.

437
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 But the mission of marriage, my second point, the mission of marriage is sanctification through service.

438
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Sanctification through service.

439
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It's not sex and a long conversation. It's sanctification through service.

440
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 As I said, sanctification is just a big theological word. It means becoming holy.

441
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Bruno Mars says, "I love you just the way you are."

442
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 But what marriage really does, what sanctification means, is it means change.

443
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 It means that the person that you marry, surrendered to the Holy Spirit, is becoming more like Christ.

444
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 That the Holy Spirit is making them more like Christ.

445
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Now I want to be clear here. You don't marry them hoping they will change.

446
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I've seen a lot of people make that mistake.

447
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Like if they're a slob today, they're probably going to be a slob tomorrow.

448
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 The Holy Spirit may leave that just the way it is. I'm not sure.

449
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And so that's true in my case. Just be honest.

450
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Meaning I'm a slob, not my wife. Like she married a slob.

451
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I mean, go look at my truck. She won't even get in my truck.

452
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Like she's like, "Hey, we're taking my car if we go anywhere."

453
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Like she's going with me. Because I'm a little messy.

454
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 You know? It's just the part of my heart that the Holy Spirit hasn't done something with yet.

455
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 You guys pray for me, pray for her. You know it's going to happen.

456
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 But don't seek to change them.

457
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Because God changes them. That's God's job.

458
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 This was breakthrough in my marriage.

459
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And so two years into marriage, like we were headed toward divorce.

460
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Was not good. I was a complete mess and not just messy room.

461
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 I mean, I was a train wreck.

462
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But we were believers. We both had trusted in Christ.

463
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 We were new believers, but we were believers. Christians.

464
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 And reading the scripture, and I had this revelation.

465
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 It was a really simple revelation. Here's the revelation.

466
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 You know, she has the Holy Spirit.

467
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And see, up until then, I had tried to make her who I wanted her to be.

468
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I was trying to, like I jumped into this marriage, made a covenant with God,

469
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 and now I'm going to make you into the wife that I want you to be.

470
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And it looked a lot like parenting or child rearing.

471
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And I realized, I'm reading the scriptures like, "Shame on me.

472
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 That's not the job of a husband.

473
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And she's not a child. She's a grown woman.

474
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And she's, you know, God is at work in her life.

475
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And so all I need to do is trust the Spirit.

476
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And if there's something that I disagree with, like she tells me something that I may disagree with,

477
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 I don't need to respond in such a way that's disrespectful or unloving or uncherishing to her.

478
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 I can say, "God, is that you?"

479
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Because it might be.

480
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Because he lives in her.

481
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And so if my first step is, "That's ridiculous,"

482
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I may be telling God, "You're ridiculous."

483
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And so my first step needs to be, "Okay, hey, I hear you. Let me repeat it.

484
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Let me take that into consideration."

485
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And I don't need to change.

486
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Like over the decades of our life and our marriage,

487
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 the Lord will change her, making her more like Jesus.

488
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And he's changing me, making me more like Jesus.

489
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And if he's changing both of us, making us more like Jesus,

490
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 then we're just going to grow closer and closer and closer and closer.

491
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 That's the truth. That's reality.

492
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 So I can trust God's work in her life,

493
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 and she can trust God's work in my life.

494
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And so what do I need to do?

495
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I need to, especially as a single person,

496
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 you need to grow a healthy appetite for service.

497
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Hey, how do I move to a place where I actually enjoy serving?

498
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 There's this idea repeated in this text.

499
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 It says in verse 28, "Husbands, love your wife as you love your own body."

500
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And he says that over and over and over.

501
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Did you see that? Like three times he's like, "Care for her like you care for your own body."

502
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Right? Now what does that mean?

503
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 When I'm hungry, what do I do?

504
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 That's right. I eat.

505
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 You got it right.

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Let's try this one. One more.

507
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 When I'm thirsty, what do I do?

508
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 That's right.

509
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 That's right. I get something to drink.

510
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And so now I have this other person in my life that I'm to care for,

511
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 and so I'm to be sensitive, in tune to her needs and desires,

512
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 so that if she's thirsty, I get her something to drink.

513
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 If she's hungry, then I'm planning on where we're going to eat.

514
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 I'm making provision in that way.

515
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 I'm thinking about someone else other than myself all the time.

516
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 That's marriage.

517
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Let me give you a real life example.

518
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 We have this king-size bed,

519
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 and we have like a knock-off, tempur-pedic mattress, a foam mattress.

520
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And I love, like when it's kind of cool, like fall weather,

521
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I may be the only one, but we have this big comforter.

522
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 You know, I pull back the comforter, and I roll into that bed,

523
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 and I just like all like snuggle up in there.

524
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 It's just like, "Shh." Like I'm about to go to sleep,

525
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 and it's just amazing what's about to go down.

526
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 I'm going to pray and then go to sleep, and it's awesome.

527
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And she gets in bed too, and she's about to go to sleep,

528
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 and it's amazing. It's just so great to go to sleep.

529
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And so my head is on my pillow, and I'm dozing off.

530
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I'm asleep. Like I'm there. I'm dreaming.

531
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And she goes, "Babe, are you up?"

532
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am now.

533
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 I'm cold.

534
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 That's interesting.

535
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Thank you for waking me up to tell me that.

536
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 I'll pray for you.

537
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Oh, man, I get my butt out of bed,

538
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 and I turn up the heat, right?

539
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 You know why?

540
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Because she's cold.

541
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And that's my problem

542
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 for the rest of my life.

543
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And that's marriage.

544
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 If you don't like to serve,

545
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 you're not going to like marriage.

546
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And if you don't want to change,

547
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 you're not going to like marriage.

548
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Because marriage is about service and sanctification.

549
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 That's the mission.

550
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 That's what happens in marriage.

551
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Ladies, I tell that story up front.

552
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Because we watch "The Bachelor" or "The Bachelorette"

553
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 or whatever, and we want the fantasy date,

554
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 the crazy, the helicopters and the mountains.

555
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And so I think there's a part of you

556
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 that would love for some guy to show up

557
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 in a Bentley GT Continental saying,

558
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 "Hey, we're going to our private airplane.

559
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 "I planned a date somewhere.

560
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 "We're going to go sit candlelight by the Riverwalk.

561
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 "I've got a limo for us there."

562
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 And I think there's a part of you

563
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 that would love that experience,

564
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 because there's something about our generation

565
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 that is chasing experiences.

566
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 We want the next experience.

567
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 But do you know why I got to go on that trip?

568
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 My daughter and I got to go on that trip.

569
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Because he had planned that as just a great day date.

570
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 But the night before, his other daughter

571
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 got the stomach bug.

572
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And so his wife had to stay home

573
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 cleaning up throw up all day.

574
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And that's marriage.

575
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And so, man, you think you want a trophy wife.

576
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 You don't want a trophy wife.

577
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 You want someone to go to war with you,

578
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 because life is a war zone.

579
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 That's what it's like.

580
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 It's hard.

581
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Everywhere you go, there's crazy.

582
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 You get home from work,

583
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 and there's crazy waiting on you.

584
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I mean, there's stuff thrown on the wall,

585
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 and kids fighting,

586
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and soccer games and practices to go to,

587
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 and somebody got in trouble at school,

588
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 and you got a parent-teacher conference.

589
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Like, this is the real life.

590
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And it's cool that she's hot,

591
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 but that's not helpful.

592
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Right?

593
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Like, you're looking for a partner,

594
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 for a helper,

595
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 someone to help you.

596
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Both of you.

597
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I'm talking to men and women right now.

598
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 That's real life.

599
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 And that's marriage.

600
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And there are amazing girls

601
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 all around you guys.

602
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Like some of you, man, I wish you'd wake up.

603
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 It's confusing.

604
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 It's confusing to me, man,

605
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 that you want marriage.

606
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 But if you want marriage, man,

607
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 you have so much opportunity all around you.

608
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Like, take a step.

609
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And can I tell you what I do when I say that?

610
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 I discourage the ladies.

611
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 I know that I do.

612
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I've done this long enough to know that I say things like,

613
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 "Ask the godliest girl out.

614
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 "Find the godliest girl out and ask her out."

615
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And then all the girls go home with insecurities.

616
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 "Well, I guess I'm not godly,

617
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 "'cause he didn't ask me out."

618
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 I know it happens.

619
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 I know I'm not a fool, okay?

620
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Guys, stop making me look like a fool.

621
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 I'm at launch retreat.

622
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 It's our Labor Day retreat.

623
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And I'm sitting between a guy and a girl.

624
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 And she's sharing some stories with me.

625
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 She's talking about, you know, going,

626
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 moving overseas to serve there

627
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 with the rest of her life.

628
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And she's like, "I just don't think, you know,

629
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 "God has marriage for me,

630
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 "because I feel this, like, real calling in my life

631
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 "to this people group."

632
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 And this guy over here, he's like,

633
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 "Well, why don't you find a husband and then go overseas?"

634
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And I think he had an ulterior motive in saying that.

635
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And I'm kind of sandwiched in the middle,

636
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 like, just listening.

637
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 And she's like, you know, "Find a husband,

638
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 "like, someone that God has already called to this place

639
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 "and to this people and to this tribe."

640
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 And, you know, like, to find a husband is hard enough as it is.

641
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 To find someone with that unique calling,

642
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 and she said this line, I wrote it down

643
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 so I could share it with you.

644
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 I hope I never forget it.

645
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 She says, "I would much rather move away and serve

646
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 "than stay here and search."

647
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 She looked at him and she said,

648
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 "I would rather go and serve

649
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 "than stay here and search."

650
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 And I just thought,

651
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 "Ask her to marry you, you know?"

652
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Verse 31, "For this reason,

653
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 "a man will leave his father and mother

654
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 "and be united to his wife,

655
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 "and the two will become one flesh."

656
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother

657
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 "and be united to his wife,

658
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 "and the two will become one flesh."

659
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Now, this is so interesting that it's here.

660
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 This also shows up in Genesis.

661
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 There's something crazy here.

662
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 If you've ever heard me talk about sex glue,

663
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 I'm not gonna go into detail right now

664
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 because I've got message after message after message

665
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 where I talk about the scientific bonding

666
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 that happens during sex,

667
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 that science has discovered

668
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 and they're really finding out

669
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 what was written thousands and thousands

670
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 and thousands of years ago in the scripture.

671
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 That God is saying, "Hey, something unique happens

672
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 "when two bond in that way."

673
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 There's a bonding.

674
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 They become one flesh.

675
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 This is crazy.

676
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 How does that happen?

677
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 But it happens.

678
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 It's real.

679
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 And now science is saying,

680
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 "Oh, and by the way,

681
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 "whenever you experience sex with someone,

682
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 "there's a bonding that happens there

683
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 "that you try to undo

684
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 "when you look at pornography

685
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 "or when you have multiple partners.

686
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 "You're carrying that prom date with you

687
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 "for the rest of your life in some ways.

688
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 "I told you it would separate."

689
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 You see this?

690
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 It's separated.

691
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 But you see that now,

692
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 after there was a tried-to-be-a-two-become-one,

693
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 both are a little more cloudy.

694
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 There's particles of the water up here

695
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 and particles of the oil down here

696
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 that both a little cloudier.

697
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Because two attempted to become one.

698
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 But they didn't stay that way.

699
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 He says, "This is a profound mystery,

700
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 "but I'm talking about Christ and the church.

701
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 "I'm using this verse from Genesis

702
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 "to explain to you about Jesus and his bride, the church.

703
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 "However, each one of you must also love his wife

704
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 "as he loves himself,"

705
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 because he didn't beat that dead horse enough,

706
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 "and the wife must respect her husband."

707
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 And so let me just say this with this verse

708
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 is there's a great book out there called Love and Respect.

709
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 It's a fantastic book.

710
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 I think we make everyone read it

711
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 in their first year of marriage.

712
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 And I'll summarize the entire book

713
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 that women want love and men want respect.

714
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 If you know that, that is a summary

715
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 of that entire book, Love and Respect,

716
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 and it comes straight from this verse.

717
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 But I want you to know that this idea of sex, too,

718
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 this idea of bonding is something for you to consider

719
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 that God, he's done something unique to our bodies

720
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 to help us in marriage.

721
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 In fact, Tim Chester, rather, in closing the window,

722
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 he said this, "You can no more try out sex

723
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 "than you can try out birth.

724
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 "The very act of sex produces a new reality

725
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 "that cannot be undone."

726
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And so I think that we think the mystery of marriage,

727
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 our fantasy, is that we get to get with someone

728
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 and try out all kinds of crazy stuff

729
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 for the rest of our lives.

730
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Experiences.

731
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 When the mystery of marriage is not about you at all.

732
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 The mystery of marriage is it showcases the Savior.

733
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 It showcases the Savior.

734
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 And the fantasy is that it's all about your happiness.

735
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 It's all about, hey, how can I experience joy?

736
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 But it's not about you at all.

737
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 It's not about you just finding someone

738
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 to pick up after you or to experience things with

739
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 or change a light bulb.

740
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 It's this reality that you get to showcase Jesus.

741
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Now listen.

742
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 If you were Satan,

743
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 if you were God's enemy,

744
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 and you knew that God had placed this really powerful metaphor

745
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 on the earth to showcase his majesty to the world

746
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 called marriage, what would you do with it?

747
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 You'd make it undoable?

748
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Do you know what you would do with it?

749
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 You'd make it all about the people.

750
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 All about the cake.

751
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 All about the dress.

752
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 All about the location.

753
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 We took the one thing that was an opportunity

754
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 to display to the world God's majesty

755
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 and we completely caked it in narcissism

756
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 and made it all about us and our emotions in a moment

757
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 and it doesn't last.

758
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Most of them don't last.

759
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 And even some of the ones that do last aren't happy,

760
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 sleeping in separate rooms,

761
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 throwing stuff against the wall,

762
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 hating each other, dysfunctional, separating.

763
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Man, you've got to figure out what it really is.

764
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 What if?

765
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 What if?

766
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Like just consider it,

767
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 that God in his might, sovereignty, and grace

768
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 loves you so much that he has you here tonight

769
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 to consider this one thing.

770
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 What if marriage is all about Jesus?

771
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 What if it's all about Jesus,

772
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 to teach you something more about Jesus

773
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 or to display to the world something about Jesus?

774
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Now you can learn things in singleness.

775
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 You can learn about the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ.

776
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 I've taught that, don't listen to that.

777
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 But I'm talking about marriage right now.

778
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 What if marriage is all about teaching us about Jesus?

779
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 When this was written, what would happen,

780
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 and I've said this before, I love this idea,

781
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 it fills my heart, I can't say it enough,

782
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 is that a young Hebrew, a young Jewish boy,

783
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 a young Hebrew boy,

784
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 when he became aged to find a wife,

785
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 he would leave his father's home

786
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 and he would go to a foreign land in search of a bride.

787
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 And he would look among God's people,

788
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 like he was trying to find the tribes

789
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 that worship the one true God,

790
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 and he would select a wife from there.

791
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 And when he would find her, they would toast,

792
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 they would pour wine in one cup,

793
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 they would both drink from that cup together,

794
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 and he would pay a dowry to her father,

795
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 he would purchase her to himself,

796
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 a high price he would pay.

797
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 And then he would leave her,

798
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 and he would go home, they're now betrothed,

799
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 they're engaged, if you will,

800
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 he would go home to his father's house,

801
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 and he would begin to build a room for them

802
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 on his father's house,

803
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 because his father's estate was one day gonna be his estate,

804
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 so he would build what was called the bridal chamber,

805
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 the room attached to his father's house

806
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 that they were gonna live in,

807
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 and he would spend his time doing that,

808
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 and he's gonna return for her at an hour in a time

809
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 that she doesn't know.

810
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 And so she's busy making preparations for the wedding,

811
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 choosing her bridesmaids,

812
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 all these traditions like a toast and bridesmaids,

813
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 they come from this idea.

814
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 He builds the house, when he finishes it,

815
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 he goes to that foreign land to get her,

816
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 and what he does is he sends word in front of him,

817
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 and they would blast trumpets,

818
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 they would blast trumpets so that it would go

819
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 from one town to the next,

820
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 he's coming for you, he's coming for you,

821
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 they would say his name, he's coming for you.

822
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 And so word would go in front of him and get to her,

823
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 oh, he's coming, and she would scramble,

824
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 get her bridesmaids ready, get the dress ready,

825
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 wait for him, and he would come,

826
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 and he would take her to his father's house.

827
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And they would go in that room,

828
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 and they would stay in there for seven days.

829
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 And there was a party going on outside for seven days,

830
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 hashtag awkward.

831
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 (congregation laughing)

832
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 And now you see where we get the seven-day honeymoon,

833
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 where it comes from, you see where these traditions

834
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 come from, but that's not what I'm trying

835
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 to tell you right now, do you see,

836
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 when Jesus says, I'm going to my father's house

837
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 to prepare a room for you,

838
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 he's saying something so much more than what you think.

839
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 He's saying, you are my bride, the church.

840
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 I've paid a dowry for you with my own blood

841
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 when I drink from this cup.

842
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 Do you see the idea, this all existed

843
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 way before your concept of marriage ever existed.

844
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 When people talk about redefining marriage,

845
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 you can't, we don't even know how to rightly define marriage.

846
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 What it actually is, that it's all about Jesus.

847
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 Piper says it this way, John Piper,

848
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 marriage is temporary, not meaning that you can undo it

849
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 with divorce, but that it doesn't exist in heaven

850
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 to each other.

851
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 That marriage is just a picture.

852
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 And it will finally give way to the relationship

853
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 to which it was pointing all along, Christ and the church,

854
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 the way a picture is no longer needed

855
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 when you see face to face.

856
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Like when I've been gone for a while,

857
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 overseas or on a trip, and I get home

858
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 and my wife greets me in the airport,

859
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 I don't just keep staring at her picture.

860
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 No, I throw the picture out and I grab her and I embrace her.

861
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 You know, it's like that's the real thing.

862
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 And marriage is just preparing you for the real thing.

863
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 All about Jesus, that's the truth.

864
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 Pastor told my wife and I before we got married,

865
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 he just said, he saw that we were a mess, you know,

866
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 doing our premarital counseling, he said,

867
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 you guys, you've got to stop pursuing each other

868
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 and start pursuing Christ together.

869
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 And we said stop pursuing each other,

870
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 he drew this picture of us just kind of missing each other,

871
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 like these arrows, right, of us just kind of

872
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 going after each other, it was manic highs and lows,

873
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 like I love you, I hate you, you know, will you marry me?

874
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Like that's what it was like, and so we were just

875
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 kind of missing each other, and then he drew this other picture,

876
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 he said I want you to stop pursuing each other

877
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 and start pursuing Christ together,

878
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 and it was like this triangle, he says,

879
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 because if you pursue Christ together,

880
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 then for the rest of your life you're just gonna grow

881
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 closer and closer and closer and closer and closer.

882
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 And do you know what I thought about that?

883
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 You know what I thought, you say, woo,

884
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 you know what I thought?

885
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 I thought that is so stupid.

886
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 I just thought that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

887
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 And it was so prophetic.

888
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 It was so true.

889
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 He spoke those words over us,

890
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 and I look back on that and it saved our marriage.

891
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 It became a reality for us that as we

892
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 pursue Christ together, we grow closer and closer,

893
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 by the grace of God, been married 14 years now,

894
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 and we're closer than we've ever been,

895
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 both to each other and to Christ.

896
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 That is a miracle.

897
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 That is the work of God.

898
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 In summary, the mandates of marriage

899
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 are sacrifice and submission.

900
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 The mission of marriage is sanctification through service.

901
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 And the mystery of marriage is it showcases the Savior.

902
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 If you want to know what to expect in marriage,

903
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 expect these things.

904
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 Because I know you're looking at it and you're scared.

905
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 I know you're looking at it and you're confused.

906
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 I know you've seen others get hurt by it.

907
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 I know you're carrying baggage.

908
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 I mean, statistics say that in the '60s,

909
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 seven out of 10 people in their 20s were married

910
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 compared to just two out of 10 today.

911
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 For the first time in history, the average American

912
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 now spends more years single than married.

913
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Divorce rate is about 50%.

914
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 And I know you're looking at this,

915
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 and some of you, you're like,

916
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 "Man, but I've made tragic mistakes, man.

917
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 "I looked at porn last night."

918
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 Maybe that's your story.

919
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 Listen, I know that's been my story in the past.

920
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 I've experienced healing.

921
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Let me tell you how.

922
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 Maybe it's the prom date,

923
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 or maybe it's the last relationship.

924
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 You know you're carrying those hurts with you.

925
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 You know that you're not whole.

926
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 You don't feel whole.

927
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 And you think, "Man, I don't want to get married

928
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 "because I'm just gonna mess somebody else up."

929
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 You know what's interesting about this is,

930
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 oil and water, they don't mix.

931
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 You know the two ingredients in mayonnaise,

932
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 the two primary ingredients?

933
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 Oil and water.

934
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 Which is confusing because there is no amount of effort

935
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 that I can mix these two together.

936
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 It's impossible.

937
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 Until you add something called an emulsifier.

938
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 Science class will tell you what an emulsifier does

939
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 is it takes the molecules of the oil

940
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 and the molecules of the water

941
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 and it bonds them together.

942
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 It allows them to be mixed.

943
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 An emulsifier in mayonnaise is eggs.

944
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 You add eggs and the oil and the water, it mixes

945
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 in a way that it couldn't without the eggs.

946
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 But I end with that to give you this hope

947
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 from this scripture.

948
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 Jesus is the emulsifier in relationships.

949
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 Like the only way two sinners can come together

950
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 and be woven together and to get along forever

951
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 on this earth is to have the one who died for their sins

952
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 enter into that relationship and be the focus

953
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 of that relationship.

954
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Am I saying that your atheist friends

955
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 can't be happily married?

956
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 I'm saying that your atheist friends

957
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 can't even experience marriage.

958
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 That what they have isn't really marriage.

959
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 Because marriage was created by God.

960
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 He gets to define what it is and its purpose

961
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 and he says it is all about Jesus.

962
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 And so whatever someone would experience

963
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 without Christ is a counterfeit version of marriage.

964
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 It's not real true intimacy as bonded

965
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 through the creator Jesus.

966
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 If you want real marriage, then today, right now,

967
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 you put Christ at the center of everything you do

968
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 because marriage and this life and you

969
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 and every relationship you've ever had

970
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 is all about Jesus.

971
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 That's the truth.

972
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 That's marriage.

973
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 Father, would you help us believe that?

974
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 Would you help us to take you at your word,

975
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 to trust what you say is true,

976
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 to live it out according to your will?

977
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 Would you redefine these ideas in our hearts

978
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 and minds that the world has placed there,

979
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 the prince of this air has placed there?

980
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 Would you replace them with truths,

981
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 with deep theologies, the mystery, as you said,

982
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 the mystery revealed,

983
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 and understanding that you sent your only son, Jesus,

984
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 to die for our sins.

985
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 You raised him from the dead so that we might have

986
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 a relationship with you forever and ever and ever.

987
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 In his name, amen.

988
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:44,000
