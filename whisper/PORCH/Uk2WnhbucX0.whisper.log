[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:32.780]   Well, good evening, Porch.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.500]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.700]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.900]   My name is Timothy Atik.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.740]   I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.680]   I want to give a huge shout out to some of our Porch Live
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.380]   locations.
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.460]   We've got Porch Live Fort Worth, Porch Live Boise,
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.060]   Porch Live Des Moines, and Porch Live Scottsdale.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.580]   So glad that you guys are tuning in tonight.
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.300]   And then we've got a lot of people right here in Dallas.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.620]   And so glad that you guys are here as well.
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.820]   So several years ago, almost a decade ago,
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.060]   I was the executive director of a ministry in Waco
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.820]   called Vertical Ministries, which
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.540]   is a ministry on the campus of Baylor University.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.560]   And Vertical met on Monday nights,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.860]   and hundreds of students would gather together,
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.460]   kind of like what we're doing now, to worship and to study
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.100]   the Bible together.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.780]   And one of the perks of doing ministry at Baylor
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.700]   was the third floor of the Baylor library
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.260]   was all spiritual books, which is really
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.620]   helpful for someone like me.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.700]   So they had every resource that I could ever want.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.420]   So I did a lot of my work from the third floor of the Baylor
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.700]   library.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.300]   And I will never forget this one time
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.980]   that I went up to work at Baylor's library.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.060]   I went up, and it was during finals week.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.720]   And so the library was packed.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.140]   Usually, it was easy to find a space.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.420]   On this particular day, I had to take a lap
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.220]   around the entire floor.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.820]   So I started going to my left, and I
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.040]   walked all the way around until I finally
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.980]   found one place to sit.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.380]   And when I sat down, I'm going to be honest,
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.640]   I was a little disappointed because I
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.460]   entered the library with some pride in my heart.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.500]   I thought, you know what?
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.460]   I speak to hundreds of students every Monday night.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.180]   I'm going into the library as the vertical guy,
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.580]   so I'm sure that as I walk and find my seat,
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.140]   there's going to be students who are waving and smiling.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.720]   They want to pull me aside and tell me
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.940]   how I changed their life.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.080]   And I got to my seat, and no one said a thing.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.360]   No one looked up.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.800]   No one gave me a wave.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.680]   And I sat down.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.760]   I was very disappointed.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.680]   And as I sat down, something very interesting
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.920]   happened because as I sat in my seat, I looked on the seat,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.240]   and there was this stream of toilet paper on my seat.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.640]   I was like, that's so interesting.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   And so I began to trace the toilet paper to its origin,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.520]   and it was the back of my pants.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.480]   And so what I realized is I had just
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.960]   taken a lap around Baylor's third floor
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.800]   with a string of toilet paper about this long hanging out
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.360]   of my pants.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.920]   And in that moment, who I thought I was
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.200]   and who I actually was collided.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.360]   Because I went to the library thinking
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.120]   I was the cool vertical guy, and then when
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.880]   I got to the library and experienced what I did,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.400]   I realized that wasn't the cool vertical guy.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.360]   I was the creepy old man who didn't
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   know how to take care of business correctly.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.200]   And who I was and who I thought I was collided in that moment.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.920]   And it was a humbling moment, very humbling moment,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.800]   as this 30-something-year-old man
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.320]   in a sea of college students sat there at his desk,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.480]   flustered, unable to concentrate.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.880]   Finally, I just packed up and left without the toilet paper.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.920]   But I tell you that because as we step into the scriptures
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.160]   tonight, we are concluding our series
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.240]   that we've been calling The Return,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.360]   Living Like Jesus is Coming Back.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.760]   And as we step into the scriptures,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.960]   we're actually going to look at a passage
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.280]   where we see what things will be like on the final day.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   Like when Jesus actually comes back,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.560]   we get a vision of what we can expect.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.920]   And what I think that we're going
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.760]   to see in the passage that we're going to look at
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.840]   is it is going to be a moment of cosmic clarification, where
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.960]   many of us, for the first time on that day when Jesus comes
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.840]   back, it will take until then for us
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.920]   to realize who we thought we were and who we actually are.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   See, if I were to sit down and I were to ask you, hey,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.200]   who are you, you know what you would start telling me?
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.720]   You would start telling me about what you figured out
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.280]   about how you're wired.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.240]   You'd be like, I'm an Enneagram 3 wing 2, or I'm an ENFJ,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   whatever the letters are.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.720]   I'm super extroverted.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.320]   I'm not.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.800]   Like you would tell me about your wiring,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.640]   but those are just things that inventories or tests
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.800]   have told you.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.600]   And there's something way more true about you.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.400]   You have been made to see Jesus as the one and only true God,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.520]   and you've been made to worship him.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.560]   And yet some of us are going to get to that last day
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.160]   where Jesus is going to come back.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.760]   And you know what we're going to realize?
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.560]   We're going to realize, we're going to look back,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.960]   and we're going to realize that we
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.760]   spent so much of our lives trying
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   to either be God or replace God.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.120]   And you might sit there and be like, when have I ever tried
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.640]   to be God?
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.340]   Well, let me ask you, when have you ever
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.680]   done the shots in your own life?
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.120]   When have you ever said, I am going to date this person,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.440]   even if it's not the best person for me to date.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.720]   This is where I'm going to work, even if I have to cut corners.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.880]   I'm going to spend more money than I make,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.080]   because this is just what I want.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.600]   When have you ever insisted on your own way?
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.800]   If you've ever insisted on your own way,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.960]   or you've bought into the philosophy that, you know what?
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.840]   I just need to find my truth, and you
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.880]   need to find your truth, and whatever truth is good for you,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.360]   that's great, and whatever truth is good for me is fine for me.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.240]   Do you know what you're doing?
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.680]   You are trying to be God.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.640]   We will realize that we've spent so much time either trying
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.260]   to be God or replace God.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.760]   And so my hope today is that we wouldn't
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.560]   have to wait to that moment to get crystal clarity.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.040]   Because in that moment, when we have that realization,
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.440]   and we see Jesus for all that he is, and in that moment,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.080]   we realize what we've actually been made for,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.560]   which is to worship him, in that moment, for many,
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.400]   it will be a very humbling moment.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.280]   But we don't have to wait till then for that humbling moment
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.880]   to come.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.480]   Right now, we can come to grips with who we are and who he is.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.640]   And we can begin to respond rightly now to who he is now.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.520]   And so that's my hope tonight.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.120]   Because I want to be clear.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.920]   There is only one God, and we are not him.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.320]   And so it is good for us to realize that humility
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.760]   is a key to eternity.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.260]   It is.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.440]   Humility is a key to eternity.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.080]   You cannot experience eternity with Jesus Christ
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.520]   without humility towards him.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.360]   So if you have a Bible, I want to invite you
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.000]   to turn with me tonight to the book of Isaiah.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Isaiah chapter 2 is where we are going to be.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.200]   Isaiah chapter 2.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.960]   Interestingly, yesterday morning, I
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.600]   woke up thinking that I was going
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.280]   a completely different direction with the message.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.680]   And in my personal time with the Lord, in my Bible reading,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.240]   I'm going through the book of Isaiah.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   And yesterday, I read Isaiah chapter 2.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.640]   And I just sensed in my heart that this
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.360]   is where the porch needs to be.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.760]   As we talk about the return, this series,
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.360]   as we bring it to conclusion, it feels
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.840]   like this passage could not be a better fit
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.880]   as it discusses the day when Jesus Christ will come back.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.800]   And as we look at this passage, what we're going to see
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.680]   is the prophet Isaiah is going to encourage the nation
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.920]   of Israel to do two things.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.800]   And my encouragement is that we would do these two things
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.280]   as well.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.680]   Here's what we're going to see.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.280]   Two things.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.360]   Number one, exalt the God who will be exalted.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.000]   Exalt the God who will be exalted.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.840]   And number two, humble yourself before you are humbled.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.360]   Humble yourself before you are humbled.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.960]   So let's start with the first one.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.520]   First word of encouragement is this, exalt
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.040]   the God who will be exalted.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.080]   When I use the word exalt, what I'm talking about
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.520]   is I'm talking about raising God's rank in your life.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.960]   I'm talking about Jesus ranking higher than anyone or anything
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.520]   else to you.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.120]   I'm talking about Jesus taking first place
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.360]   in your life and everything else being a distant second.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   Because a day is coming when God will
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.880]   be revealed as greater than anyone or anything.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.800]   So look with me at Isaiah chapter 2, verse 1.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.160]   It says, "The word that Isaiah, the son of Amos,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.960]   saw concerning Judah in Jerusalem,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.720]   it shall come to pass in the latter days."
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.160]   That in the Hebrew, it means the culmination of days.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.280]   So what we're looking at right here
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.960]   is what we can expect at the culmination of days,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.080]   the days when Jesus Christ will come back.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.720]   It will come to pass in the latter days.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.360]   "That the mountain of the house of the Lord
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.040]   shall be established as the highest of the mountains
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.800]   and shall be lifted up above the hills,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.400]   and all the nations shall flow to it."
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.880]   So don't miss what I'm telling you right now.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.280]   In the ancient Near East, mountains
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.960]   were very important in various religions
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.120]   because mountains were considered
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.800]   to be the places where heaven met earth.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.680]   And mountains were considered
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.120]   the dwelling places of the gods.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.560]   And so what Isaiah is reminding Israel of is,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.360]   on that day when God is revealed
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.200]   and we see God for who he is,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.440]   God's mountain will dwarf any other mountains.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   All other mountains will just fade away.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.480]   And God will be seen as the one and only true God.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.440]   He will be seen as preeminent,
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   that there is no one in nothing that rivals God.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.800]   So here's what that means.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.720]   If the Bible is correct, then when Jesus comes back,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.400]   there is going to be this cosmic clarification
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.680]   where we will find out that there has only been one true God
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.360]   and when his majesty and his splendor is revealed
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   in such a way that every eye on the planet will see him,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.400]   we will realize that all along,
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.160]   every single day of our lives,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.000]   he was the only one who deserved our greatest allegiance
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.200]   and affection and adoration and obsession.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.080]   Do you realize that that day is coming
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.440]   where you have the perspective
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   that no one deserved allegiance, affection, adoration
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.200]   or your obsession like Jesus did?
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.640]   Anyone or anything else that we have exalted
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   or ranked above God will seem infinitely insignificant
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.360]   in that moment.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.240]   So the question is, what does it look like now
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.120]   for us to begin to exalt him?
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.620]   What does it look like for us to live now
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.680]   how we will live for all of eternity?
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.580]   One of the best things we can do is begin to live
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.120]   how we will live in heaven.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.560]   We should live that way now.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.520]   If we will spend eternity exalting God,
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.320]   we should spend the rest of our time on earth exalting God.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.880]   If he will take first place in our lives in heaven,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.600]   he should take first place in our lives on earth.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.400]   But first we have to identify
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.880]   what do we tend to exalt above God?
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.820]   I'm gonna show you something
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.580]   that I'm probably going to regret.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.260]   My freshman year in college,
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.760]   I was in a dating relationship
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.760]   and I still have the mementos from that relationship.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.100]   Now, the question is gonna surface in your mind,
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.800]   why do you still have that stuff?
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.880]   So here's the reality.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   It was in my parents' house for years.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.780]   And I looked up in the closet and I saw it,
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.700]   I was like, that'd be a great sermon illustration.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.880]   My mom never threw it away when she was cleaning out.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.860]   And I was married, my wife knew that I took it.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.540]   Like I'm not at home like, my precious.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.940]   Like, it's not like that, all right?
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.820]   So just to be clear, I'm not a freak, I'm not a weirdo.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.380]   Like this is just, it's just, I had it.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.540]   So, and if you're the girl
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.300]   and at some point you see this, I'm sorry.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.580]   I promise I'm happily married.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.420]   Like I'm not, anyway, okay.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.740]   This was a beanie baby that she gave me.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.160]   She sprayed it with her perfume so I could,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.000]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.960]   So there was that.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:31.100]   This right here was a, this is called a mouse pad
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.900]   when we used to need mice for our computers.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.900]   It was a baseball glove, I didn't play baseball,
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.740]   but there was a collage of her pictures
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.580]   so that I could always see her.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.400]   So that's that.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.220]   This is a pillow that we have a picture of the two of us
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.540]   ironed onto.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.940]   So yeah, that's great.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:56.780]   This unfortunately broke, but for you young people,
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.680]   this is called a CD, a compact disc.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.180]   It's titled, "For My Perfect Boyfriend."
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.220]   That's this guy.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:12.620]   And then this'll make you throw up in your mouth.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.300]   And some of you guys went to A&M and you're like,
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.020]   not this again, God help me.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.020]   But this, to be clear, I made this.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.580]   And this is so dumb.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.700]   This is a printout of every,
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:39.340]   don't judge me, of every message conversation.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.820]   Hey, therapy has been super helpful.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:52.780]   Now, let's just pray and get out of here.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.740]   That's just.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:16:00.860]   So, question.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:07.460]   The disappointment in your faces, like it's real.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.140]   Question, and if you've seen this and know the answer,
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:13.980]   don't yell it out.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.760]   How long do you think we dated?
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:24.600]   Two months.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.800]   I heard you, two months.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.980]   Two months, yep.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.240]   Now, don't miss this.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.080]   Don't miss this.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.860]   Some of you are like, are you kidding me?
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.240]   He is crazy.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.360]   Here's what I can say confidently.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.980]   What I can say with absolute certainty
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.580]   is that for those two months,
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.300]   that girl was without a doubt my God.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.460]   And I was a follower of Jesus Christ at the time,
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.140]   but for those two months,
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.320]   she was hands down without a doubt my God.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.660]   She got all of my time.
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.260]   She got all of my attention.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.580]   She received all of my affection.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.940]   She was for those two months, my obsession.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.300]   And you can sit there and judge me
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.080]   and I don't blame you at all.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.960]   I show you that to get you laughing
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.660]   before I turn it back on you and say,
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.420]   you might not have all this junk to show for it,
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.220]   but what's in your bag?
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.380]   What's in your bag?
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.380]   Who or what are you exalting above God?
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.260]   What's your greatest allegiance to?
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.220]   What do you adore the most?
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.460]   What gets the majority of your affection?
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.140]   What is your obsession?
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.940]   Like what do you lay awake at night thinking about?
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.500]   What do you lose sleep over?
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.300]   What stirs your heart in a way that Jesus never has?
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.340]   Maybe it's working out.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.260]   Maybe it's your body.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260]   Maybe it's just, that's just all you can think about
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.980]   is how you look.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.980]   Maybe it's your car.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.680]   Maybe it's money.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.000]   Maybe it's social media.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.140]   Maybe it's constantly having plans on the weekend.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.320]   Maybe it's the pursuit of the American dream.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.060]   Maybe it's busyness, so you always feel important.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.460]   Maybe it's having letters after your name,
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.860]   like MD or PhD.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.300]   Maybe it's an influencer that you just hang on
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.100]   everything they say or do.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.980]   It could be a pastor.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.540]   It concerns me when I hear people are like,
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.340]   Ben said, Jenny said, JP said.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.600]   I'm like, do you care more about hearing from them
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.100]   than God himself?
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.920]   And so it's just good for us to ask,
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.780]   what do we exalt more than Christ?
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.500]   What takes first place in your life, in mine?
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.740]   Do you wanna know the realization that I had
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.900]   as I just thought about all this stuff?
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.900]   Do you know what I felt once I got out of the relationship
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.020]   and got perspective?
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.900]   I felt embarrassment.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.940]   I felt embarrassment that I had such a strong obsession
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.180]   in such a short period of time.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.720]   My fear is that some of us are going to eventually
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.620]   see Jesus face to face, and in that moment,
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.460]   what we're gonna realize is that we had far too weak
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.460]   of an affection for far too long of a period of time.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.700]   C.S. Lewis puts it this way.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.740]   He says, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   not too strong, but too weak.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.460]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.380]   and sex and ambition.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.000]   When infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.920]   who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.460]   because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.960]   of a holiday at sea, we are far too easily pleased.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.200]   Some of us, we lay in bed at night restless.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.920]   Do you know what's happening is your soul is longing
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.360]   for the one for whom it's been created, Jesus.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.880]   He's the only one who can satisfy the deepest longings
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.060]   of your soul.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.860]   I said this on the first week of the series,
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.320]   so I just wanna say it again.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   Don't wait until you see Jesus to finally see Jesus.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.180]   Don't wait until you see Jesus to finally see Jesus.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.600]   Don't wait for that day for Christ to finally be exalted.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.100]   Today is the day for him to take first place
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.280]   in everything else to take a distant second.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.180]   So you might ask, well, what does it look like
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.540]   for Christ to be exalted in my life?
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.120]   Well, here's the good news is if we keep reading
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.080]   in Isaiah chapter two, what we get is we get a picture
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.340]   of that day when Christ comes back.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.640]   And what we see is we see people exalting Christ
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.780]   and it's very instructive.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.920]   So look with me back at the text.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.260]   It says at the end of verse two,
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.680]   "And all the nations shall flow to it."
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.520]   Flow to what?
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.880]   To the mountain of God.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.540]   Verse three, "And many people shall come and say,
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.520]   "Come, let us go up the mountain of the Lord
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.060]   "to the house of the God of Jacob,
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.760]   "that he may teach us his ways,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.680]   "that we may walk in his paths.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.160]   "For out of Zion shall go forth the law
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.520]   "and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.900]   "He shall judge between the nations
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.040]   "and shall decide disputes for many peoples
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.100]   "and they shall beat their swords into plowshares
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.260]   "and their spears into pruning hooks.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.760]   "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.560]   "neither shall they learn war anymore."
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.560]   So do you see what we see there?
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.100]   We see that a day is coming where a magnitude
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.060]   of universal proportions of people
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.220]   will be seeking and hungering for God.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:11.860]   There will be people from every tribe, tongue, and nation,
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.180]   every people group who are seeking after God.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.740]   And as they seek for God, how will Christ be exalted?
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.820]   Well, they will hunger for him.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.040]   They will want to see him and behold him.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.140]   They will want to learn from him.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.060]   His word will be supremely authoritative in their lives.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.240]   His ways will be the only true way.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.140]   That's what it looks like to exalt Christ.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.900]   Now it's for you to position your life
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.440]   to where you consistently gaze at Jesus Christ,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.740]   for you to see him for who he truly is.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.860]   It's waking up each morning and coming to his word
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.820]   and saying, "Jesus, I want to see you in your word.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.400]   "I want to learn from you.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.900]   "You have a right to speak into my life.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.020]   "Your ways are the best ways.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.620]   "I choose you, Jesus, about anything else in my life.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.520]   "Your way is the best way.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   "You, Jesus, have a right to rule in my heart
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.860]   "and in my life."
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.560]   That's what it looks like to exalt Christ.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.740]   And what we see is a day is coming
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.280]   where Jesus' rule will be realized throughout the earth.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.900]   That's why you see the spears are turned into,
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.240]   or swords are turned into pruning hooks
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.560]   or into plowshares.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.620]   What is that imagery?
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.360]   It's that items of war become farming tools
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.580]   because Eden in some way will be restored.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.480]   Paradise will be restored.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.320]   And we will have the privilege of spending all of eternity
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.740]   in the presence of Jesus.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:55.960]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.700]   One thing that I see happening,
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.220]   especially with young adults,
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.340]   it happened with my group of friends
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.440]   coming out of Tex A&M,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.220]   is sometimes we take intermissions
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.100]   between Jesus being Savior and Jesus being Lord.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.160]   And so we want Jesus to save us from our sin,
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.020]   but we don't necessarily want Jesus to save us
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.060]   into a new life with him
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.780]   where he begins to lead us and direct us
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.480]   and call the shots.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.500]   And so we want Jesus to be Savior.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.920]   And it's like, yes, I'm so thankful
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.860]   that you are my ticket into heaven.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.380]   But Jesus isn't just Savior, he's also King.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.340]   What do kings do?
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.180]   Kings rule.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.740]   He's given you his word so you can know his ways.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.060]   He's given you his spirit
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.700]   because his spirit wants to make you more like him.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.460]   So here's what you need to know.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.260]   When Jesus Christ went to the cross,
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.460]   when he sacrificed himself,
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.700]   when he endured the wrath of God for your sins and mine,
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.980]   when he walked out of the grave victoriously,
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.860]   he didn't just do it to get you into heaven.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.960]   He did it to get heaven into you now.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.640]   He wants to make you more like him now.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.640]   And that happens by us beginning to exalt him,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:24.400]   by allowing him to take first place.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.840]   If you're here tonight
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.480]   and you're not a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.240]   you're not a Christian, someone invited you,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.940]   let me just say, I'm so glad you're here.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.440]   The porch will always be a place
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.400]   where people who don't know Jesus can come
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.280]   and just explore and ask questions and figure it out.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.100]   But you might've just heard me say
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.680]   that a day is coming where God,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.480]   the God where Jesus is God,
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   will one day be shown to be the only true God.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.840]   And maybe you have believed in another religion
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.560]   or another God and what I'm saying is confusing to you
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.000]   or frustrating to you.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.720]   Here's what I would just say to you.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.600]   We live in a world right now
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.800]   where we wanna act like heaven is kind of a ski mountain
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.000]   and there's a bunch of different lifts to get to heaven.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.800]   And so as long as you find your way to the top
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.220]   and I find my way to the top,
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.060]   it really doesn't matter
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.040]   because they all end in the same place.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.480]   But here's what every religion,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.060]   here's the question every religion needs to answer.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.520]   How do we imperfect people get to be with a perfect God?
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.660]   How do we down here, imperfect people,
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.580]   get up there with a perfect God in a perfect place, heaven?
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.500]   It's impossible.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.780]   No matter how hard you try to get to him,
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.620]   you will always be imperfect.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.120]   See, the good news of the gospel is that
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.420]   God came down the mountain to get us.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.880]   Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.440]   The eternal word of God took on flesh, Jesus Christ.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.180]   He lived a perfect life.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.880]   He died in our place.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.680]   He conquered death.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.540]   Why?
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.380]   So that he could take imperfect people with him to heaven
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.240]   and his perfection would be our entrance
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.880]   and his perfection would be what sustains us
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.620]   for all of eternity.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.020]   Do you know him?
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.800]   If you don't, then let me just encourage you
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.760]   to be careful with the idea of, you know what?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.520]   I'll just find my own truth.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.800]   Here's what you have to remember.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.760]   Just because you believe something doesn't mean it's true.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.300]   Your beliefs have no bearing on truth, okay?
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.080]   And so you can believe it, but that doesn't mean it's true.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.360]   Finding your own truth might bring you comfort temporarily,
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.160]   but cannot support you for eternity.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   If the Bible is true, a day is coming
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.240]   when it will be revealed that there is only one true God.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.060]   And that one true God has been deserving
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.160]   of your greatest affection every day of your life
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.880]   and will be for all of eternity.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.600]   So the first thing is exalt the God,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.760]   the God where Jesus is God, exalt the God
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.840]   who will be exalted.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.780]   And then number two, humble yourselves
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.400]   before you are humbled.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.280]   Humble yourselves before you are humbled.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.600]   Do you know what pride is?
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.840]   Pride is the posture of your life and heart
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.440]   when you have an inflated view of God,
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.040]   when you have an inflated view of self
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.440]   due to a deflated view of God.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.640]   That's what pride is.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.360]   Pride is the posture of your life and heart
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.480]   when you have an inflated view of yourself
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.820]   and a deflated view of God.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.040]   Humility is the reverse.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.720]   An inflated view of God,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.880]   which breeds a deflated view of self.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.400]   He is great, we are not.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.960]   He is God, we are not.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.040]   And so look at what Isaiah chapter two, verse five says.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.960]   It says, "O house of Jacob, come,
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.680]   "let us walk in the light of the Lord."
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.880]   What is the light of the Lord?
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.520]   It is what gives us guidance and direction.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.160]   There's gonna be a contrast here
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.040]   because Isaiah goes on and says,
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:08.920]   "For you," that's God has rejected your people,
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.200]   the nation of Israel, the house of Jacob, why?
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.320]   Because they are full of things from the east.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.000]   The sun rises in what?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.040]   The east.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.520]   Some of y'all are like, not sure.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.600]   The east.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   And so what Isaiah is saying is,
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.120]   hey, you guys are looking to the light of the world.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.280]   Instead of the light of God.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.120]   What he's doing is he's calling them out
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.520]   and saying, you're looking within,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.060]   you're looking under the sun for life,
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:48.060]   instead of looking beyond the sun to God for your direction.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:54.000]   You're full of things from the east.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.240]   And of fortune tellers like the Philistines,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.040]   he's saying you're relying on human ingenuity.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.680]   And they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.140]   He's saying, you guys are learning
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.680]   and you're taking pages from the playbooks
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.820]   of people who do not know God.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.580]   And so what's the result?
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.660]   The result is pride.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.660]   The result is pride because what the nation of Israel
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.140]   is guilty of doing is they are trying to be God.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.600]   How are they trying to be God?
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.280]   Because they're saying, you know what?
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.280]   We can figure out life on our own under the sun.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.100]   We can use human ingenuity to figure out the best way.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.040]   They're looking at other people who don't know God
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.180]   and learning from them and they're saying, you know what?
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.720]   We can do this without God.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.960]   They're trying to be God.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.760]   And not only are they trying to be God,
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.480]   they're trying to replace God.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.440]   He goes on in verse seven and says,
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.640]   their land is filled with silver and gold
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.620]   and there's no end to their treasures.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.440]   They were looking to material wealth
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.880]   and stuff to be their God.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   Their land is filled with horses
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.360]   and there's no end to their chariots.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.780]   They were looking to security to be their God.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.100]   Their land is filled with idols.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.900]   They bow down to the work of their hands,
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.960]   to what their own fingers have made.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.960]   They're looking to man-made religion to be their God.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.800]   They are actually making gods
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.140]   in finding their fulfillment in them.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.080]   That's what they're doing.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.020]   And the crazy thing is that not much has changed
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.300]   in the thousands of years since the book of Isaiah
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.140]   was written.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.480]   So let me just ask you to just look at me real quick
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.900]   and answer this question.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.160]   We'll even have it on the screen.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.660]   Just fill in the blank.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.900]   If I only had what, then I would be happy.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.720]   What is it?
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.540]   Just fill in the blank.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.580]   If I only had what, what is it?
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.900]   Then you would be happy.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.820]   See, some of us believe just like the nation of Israel,
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.660]   the key to happiness is stuff.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.300]   It's stuff, it's material possessions or it's status.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.900]   You want a job title that you're proud to say
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.000]   when you are in groups of people
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.420]   because it will give you significance.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.620]   You value stuff.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.060]   You want to drive the car you want to drive.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.120]   You want to live in the apartment complex
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.960]   you want to live in.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.260]   You want to go ahead and buy a house now.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.680]   You want stuff.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.320]   You want season tickets to the maps.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.860]   You want your own stuff.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.420]   That's where happiness is found.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.680]   For others of you, the key to happiness is security.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.540]   So man, you're saving all your money
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.360]   because when you look at your bank account,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.360]   like there's safety and security there.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.060]   When you look at how your 401k is accumulating money,
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.300]   there's security there.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.540]   Or if you could just get a spouse,
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.660]   then you would feel safe and secure
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.100]   that you're not going to be single forever.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.000]   And for others, the key to happiness is,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.500]   it's man-made religion.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.000]   It's you just figuring out
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.700]   what makes you feel good about yourself.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.900]   So you know what, I go to the porch on Tuesday night
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.180]   because I just feel better about myself after I go.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.860]   You know what, I read that latest pastor's book
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.900]   and it's kind of, I'm doing that instead of reading
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.740]   my Bible, but it's kind of the same thing
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.500]   because there's Bible verses in it.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:29.340]   And so really that makes me feel better about myself.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.940]   It's man-made religion.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.540]   Maybe you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.540]   but in your time with God, time with God is you,
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:44.740]   just, it's you feeling better.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.460]   Like you're a better person than other people.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.240]   So you spend your time with God and then you go out
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.020]   and you feel like you are crushing life
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.900]   in a way that others aren't.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.980]   So your time with God is more about your image
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.820]   than it is about intimacy with God.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.980]   And so you know what we're doing?
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.900]   We're taking God's gifts, 'cause these aren't bad things.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.780]   401ks, they're good things, you should save, people.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.580]   Driving a car, not a bad thing.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.140]   You're probably gonna need one.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.220]   These things aren't bad in and of themselves.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.640]   You know where they go bad is when we take God's gifts
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.260]   and we turn them into God's.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.680]   That is what we tend to do.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.160]   We take good things and we make them ultimate things.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:35.400]   And we switch places with God.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:43.840]   We have to understand that to try to be God
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.160]   or to replace God is to be against God.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.440]   There isn't a form of Christianity
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.060]   where it is acceptable to God for us to function
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.840]   like one pastor said, Christian atheists.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.040]   What's a Christian atheist?
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.400]   A Christian atheist is someone
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.640]   who gets their ticket into heaven
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.400]   and they call themselves a Christian
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.800]   and yet they live like they don't know Jesus,
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.480]   the one who will be exalted over all the earth.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.580]   And so we try and be God or we try and replace God.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.780]   That is Christian atheism.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:23.940]   Several years ago, we made plans to take our boys
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:29.140]   to Legoland in California.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:33.380]   So Legoland, it's this great amusement park.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's just built out of Legos.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.380]   Like it's crazy, it's amazing.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.700]   It's a dream for a five-year-old boy.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.760]   So we were planning to go to Legoland.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.660]   We were going in about two to three weeks
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.560]   and we were living in Austin at the time.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.980]   We went into the Barton Creek Mall,
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.060]   if you've ever been there.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.500]   And in Barton Creek, there was a Lego store.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.840]   So we went into the Lego store
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.420]   and my son Noah, who was about five years old at the time,
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   he saw this Lego key chain.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.460]   He was like, "Dad, can I have the Lego key chain?"
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.520]   I was like, "Hey dude, here's the deal."
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.780]   In like two, three weeks, we're going to Legoland.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.460]   Not Lego store, Legoland.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.900]   And you can get whatever you want then.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.420]   "But dad, I want the Lego key chain now."
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.500]   And this was not the best parenting.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.180]   I'm just going to own it from now.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.140]   Like I was just kind of thinking on the spot.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.380]   When you're a parent, you know what parenting is.
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.260]   Parenting is having no clue what to do
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.860]   and just trying your best.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.060]   That's what parenting is.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.900]   So in the moment, here's what I said.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.060]   I was like, "Hey man, here's the deal.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.480]   "We can either go to Legoland,
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.640]   "you can get whatever you want,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.060]   "or you can get this key chain.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.020]   "We can cancel going to Legoland."
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.380]   It was a bluff, people.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.220]   It was a bluff.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.500]   I wouldn't have canceled the trip.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.460]   You know what he said?
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.620]   "I'll take the key chain."
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.320]   I was like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.980]   But you know what Noah was saying?
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   He was saying, "This is what I need most."
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.380]   And yet me, his dad, I had a perspective
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.260]   that he didn't have.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.220]   I knew what was waiting for him.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.860]   I knew all of the beauty, all of the greatness,
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.700]   all of the enjoyment that waited for him.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.140]   But in his mind, this is what he needed now.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.460]   And so when a five-year-old does that with Legoland,
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.020]   we chalk it up to youth.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.380]   But when adults do that with God,
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.100]   when God has given us his word,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.340]   and what has he declared to us in his word?
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.140]   There is no other God but me.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.380]   In my presence, there is fullness of joy.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.620]   At my right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.060]   I came that you might have life and have it to the full.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.700]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.540]   No one comes to the Father except through me.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.300]   And yet we're like, "You know what?
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.220]   "But you know what?
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.300]   "I'm gonna find my life in this stuff,
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:00.140]   "or in this person, or in this thing, or in this status."
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.080]   When it's a five-year-old with Legoland, that's youth.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.380]   When it's an adult doing that with God, that's pride.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.620]   It's pride.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:15.020]   And so my encouragement to us
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.580]   is that we would humble ourselves before we are humbled.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.700]   Because look at what Isaiah 2, verses 9 through 11 say.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:27.780]   It says this, "So man is humbled.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.060]   "Each one is brought low.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.420]   "Do not forgive them.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.320]   "Enter into the rock and hide in the dust
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.060]   "from before the terror of the Lord
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.180]   "and from the splendor of his majesty.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.680]   "The haughty looks of man shall be brought low.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.040]   "The lofty pride of men shall be humbled.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.900]   "The Lord alone will be exalted in that day."
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.740]   It's interesting because what Isaiah is saying is,
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.660]   "Look, you've looked for life
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.440]   "and you have made gods out of things in the material world.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.120]   "So because that's where you looked for life,
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.440]   "that's where you're gonna have to look to hide
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.800]   "when the majesty and splendor melts everything away
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   "and all you see is God exalted above the earth."
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:17.580]   So his point is come now, humble yourselves now.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.760]   Don't wait to be humbled.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   Humble yourselves now under the mighty hand of God.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.420]   When Jesus comes back, we will have one of two responses,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.940]   either worship or shame.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.560]   We will either worship him
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.480]   because that's what we've already been doing.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.860]   We've already seen him for who he is, the one true God.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.780]   And so we've lived lives of worship.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.500]   And when he comes back, our worship just intensifies.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.240]   Or we're gonna experience shame
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.440]   because we're gonna realize that we spent our lives
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.020]   worshiping the wrong gods.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.940]   And so let me just ask, where do we go from here?
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.640]   What I'm trying to do is I'm not trying to beat us
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.740]   over the head tonight.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.480]   I'm trying to drive us towards humility.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.240]   I'm trying to drive us towards sight
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.040]   for us to open up our eyes, to not just live for today,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   but to live for eternity, to not just live for today,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.880]   but to live for that day.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.680]   Jesus is coming back.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.440]   It's not a question of if, it's a matter of when.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.680]   We don't know.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.920]   So one of the, you know what the greatest form of pride is?
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.840]   It's to say, well, it won't be today
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.380]   and it won't be tomorrow.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.440]   And so I'll figure it out someday.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.100]   That's the greatest form of pride
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:45.100]   because what you're saying is I know that I'm fine
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.520]   until I decide to get right with God.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.640]   When my kids were young,
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.240]   I'd take them to the grocery store with me
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.360]   and you've seen these shopping carts,
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.480]   but grocery stores have shopping carts that are race cars,
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.360]   which are amazing.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.600]   Always get the race cars if you've got kids
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.720]   like two or three years old.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.960]   So you put your kid in the car
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.840]   and there's a steering wheel there
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.440]   and they sit there and drive
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.040]   while you were pushing them through.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.680]   Now, I want you to think about this.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.040]   Imagine what it would be like in the grocery store
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.480]   if there was actually power to those steering wheels.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.920]   Can you imagine the madness, the chaos
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.060]   when little toddlers have their way?
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:37.840]   Now, thankfully there is no power to those steering wheels
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.760]   and there is a good parent who's in control
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.560]   running the show.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.620]   See, we all have to come to a realization
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.720]   that there is a difference between who we think we are
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.020]   and who we actually are.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:56.400]   Who we think we are is we think that we're God,
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   that we're in control,
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.740]   that we can figure life out on our own,
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.940]   that if there's power to the steering wheel,
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.640]   we can flourish.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.320]   But who we actually are is we're the toddler
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   in the shopping cart and left to ourselves.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.640]   We're broken.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.800]   What we all have to do is we have to look back
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   and we have to see that there is a good, perfect father
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.120]   who is directing our lives
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.400]   and his son Jesus has come to restore us
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.760]   into right relationship with the father.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.600]   Why?
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.840]   So that we can live life with him.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.800]   (gentle music)
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.720]   Humility is the key to eternity.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.760]   So if you're here tonight and you don't know Jesus Christ,
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.880]   then my encouragement to you tonight
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:55.200]   is to make a decision to seek out the truth,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.180]   not your truth, the truth.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.320]   Seek it out.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.200]   Go on a relentless search
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:08.040]   until you find the truth.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.840]   And I believe you will find the truth in Jesus Christ.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.080]   Humble yourself.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.800]   Make the decision.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.000]   You don't have it all figured out.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.820]   That's okay.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.660]   None of us do.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.420]   But find the truth.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.640]   If you're here and you consider yourself a Christian,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.120]   I'm not trying to cause anyone to doubt their salvation.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.640]   I'm just trying to have a clarifying conversation
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.880]   with a few people in the room.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.740]   If you call yourself a Christian
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:36.960]   and yet you spend your days trying to be God
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.600]   or replace God,
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.240]   all I wanna do is I wanna invite you
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.960]   to humble yourself and repent tonight.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.860]   And I wanna invite you to see Jesus clearly.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.840]   Who is our Jesus?
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.440]   Jesus is the one who humbled himself.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.440]   Philippians 2 says that he humbled himself
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.040]   and he became a servant.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.440]   And he died.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.780]   He died in our place.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.780]   He humbled himself to the point of death,
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.780]   even death on a cross.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.580]   And after his death, he walked out of a tomb.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.900]   Therefore, he has been highly exalted
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.300]   and he has the name which is above every name
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.500]   so that at the name of Jesus,
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.820]   every knee would bow and every tongue would confess
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.660]   that he is Lord.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.540]   That's who he is.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.840]   I'm inviting you tonight to repent,
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.340]   to turn from your ways of being God or replacing God
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.600]   and turn to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.220]   and fully surrender to him.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:44.380]   And finally, if you have a real and intimate,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.700]   enjoyable relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.100]   then my encouragement to you
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:52.900]   is just continually identify the things
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.900]   that threaten to compete with God's place in your life.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:04.260]   Even right now, just identify who or what
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.380]   are you sensing you need more than you need Jesus.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.700]   And whatever it is, just turn that over to the Lord
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.140]   and invite him to do a new work in your life.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.580]   Ask him to give you eyes to see him more clearly
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.860]   so that he would be exalted in your life.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.180]   And then I would just leave you
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.460]   with the words of John the Baptist.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.700]   John the Baptist says in John 3:30,
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.820]   these are words to live by.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.580]   He says, "He must increase, but I must decrease."
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.140]   That's humility.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.360]   That's coming to the realization
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.740]   of not who you think you are, but who you actually are.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.180]   That you've been made to worship him
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.020]   and he is the exalted one over all creation.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.940]   He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.940]   Let's pray together.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.520]   (gentle music)
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:04.060]   Lord, if there's anyone in this room tonight
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.180]   who doesn't know you,
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:10.800]   then my hope and prayer, even in this moment,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.920]   is that they would sense
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.020]   that you are reaching into their lives,
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.820]   opening up their eyes
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.320]   so that they can see you clearly, Lord Jesus.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.060]   I pray that there would be someone tonight
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.660]   who would put their trust in you.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.940]   And if that's you, if you're here tonight
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.820]   and you're just saying, "Yeah, I wanna say yes to Jesus."
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.500]   If that's you, just right where you are,
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.140]   just pray in the quietness of your own heart.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.360]   Say, "Lord Jesus, I want you to be exalted in my life.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.060]   "Thank you that you died for me.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.660]   "Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.360]   "Would you come into my life?
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.300]   "Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.540]   "Would you begin to lead me in a new life?"
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:52.580]   And for the rest of us,
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.460]   I just wanna invite you to do business with the Lord
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.380]   in the quietness of your own heart.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.540]   Maybe the worst thing you could do right now
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:04.140]   is just rush out or to quickly respond by singing.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.020]   Maybe you just need to do business with Him.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.420]   Maybe you need to confess
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.340]   where you have exalted other people or other things,
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.540]   where you've tried to play God in your own life,
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.400]   and you just need to ask for forgiveness.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.600]   You need to experience His grace.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.800]   Whatever He's doing in your life, respond to Him now.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.880]   Lord Jesus, we need you, we love you.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.360]   Be exalted in this place for our good and for your glory.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.940]   In Jesus' name.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.520]   (gentle music)
