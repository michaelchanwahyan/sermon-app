1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,760
 - All right, well, welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,440
 friends in Fort Worth, friends in Houston,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,440
 El Paso, Tulsa, Cedar Springs, wherever you are, tuning in.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,160
 We are continuing this series, Vice and Virtue.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,240
 I'm gonna start with a story that'll give us

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,320
 some direction for where we're going.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,200
 A few years ago, at something we call staff prayer,

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,840
 once a week, our staff at Watermark,

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,120
 couple hundred of us get together and meet Tuesdays,

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,640
 and it's usually almost exclusively staff,

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,080
 and every once in a while, someone who has a relationship

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,040
 with a member on staff will get invited to be a part of it.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,120
 And so, there was a guy who was a missionary in Russia,

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,640
 who had been there for the last eight years,

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,920
 he was formerly in Dallas, had some connections

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,040
 and relationships with people on our staff,

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,680
 and he was back visiting, and so he came

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,960
 and he joined us for staff prayer.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,680
 And so, we're sitting around in this circle,

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,760
 and he's sharing about what God is up to in Russia,

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,320
 and then there was a chance for just kind of like

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,120
 a conversation that took place with him,

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,480
 and one person asked him, hey, you haven't been here

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,400
 in eight years in Dallas, what has changed?

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,160
 And I'll never forget his answer,

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,080
 'cause he like immediately had an answer.

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,600
 He said, oh, all the storage units,

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,800
 or all the storage facilities.

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,420
 And our response was a lot like your response.

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,200
 All the storage facilities?

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,040
 What are you talking about?

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,860
 All the storage?

34
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,120
 Yeah, all the storage facilities, they're everywhere.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,040
 These little like facilities where you store stuff

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,120
 and where you put your stuff, like they're popping up,

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,100
 they're exploding, and we all, almost as a staff,

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,360
 everyone that was there that day,

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,840
 we would laugh about it now, 'cause we all

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,680
 had the same experience.

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,920
 What are you talking about?

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,120
 And then we left and we would go drive around,

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,000
 and then it was like, there are storage units

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,840
 everywhere around here.

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
 This is crazy.

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,000
 I mean, you drive up 75, 635, I'm certain it's the same

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,320
 in Fort Worth and in Houston, and there really are.

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,240
 As he just said, man, Americans have so much stuff

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,320
 that they are running out of places to even put it

50
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,160
 in their house.

51
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,000
 Most people are concerned about,

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
 will we even be able to have a house?

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,180
 We are concerned about, are we gonna have a house

54
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,360
 for our stuff to put in?

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
 And really, it's not just something where I'm inviting you

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,240
 to, hey, now you'll drive around and see it,

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,840
 though now you will.

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,880
 It is a, as I looked into that idea this week

59
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,400
 or was studying this week, it's crazy

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
 how many storage unit facilities we have in America.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,960
 Like if there was a gold medal sport called hoarding,

62
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,120
 America is gonna win first, second, and third every time.

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
 Like here's what I mean by that.

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,800
 There are 58,000 storage unit facilities in America.

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,100
 Not storage units, not like, oh, one little box counts

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,800
 as one, facilities or different locations for these places.

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,800
 58,000, that is more than McDonald's,

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,200
 number of McDonald's, Starbucks, Walmarts, Walgreens,

69
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,600
 CVS, and 7-Eleven combined.

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
 In other words, it's like, man, this is Starbucks

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,360
 in every corner.

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,240
 There is 10 times as many storage unit facilities,

73
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,760
 look it up, as there are Starbucks, not right now,

74
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,100
 but look it up.

75
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,960
 I mean, if you combine all of those, Walmart, 7-Eleven,

76
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,240
 Walgreens, CVS, Starbucks, McDonald's,

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,920
 those golden arches you see everywhere,

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,640
 they pale in comparison to the number,

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,520
 there's almost four times as many storage unit facilities.

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,440
 It's crazy.

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,360
 In all of Europe, this is going to where I promise,

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
 in all of Europe, if you were to guess,

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,840
 how many storage unit facilities, like, you know,

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
 Europe's really big, it's bigger than America.

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,860
 How many do they have over there?

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,300
 America has 58,000, Europe has 2,400 total.

87
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,800
 I mean, it is an American phenomenon.

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,740
 We are the world-class best in sport at accumulating stuff,

89
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,700
 stuff, stuff.

90
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,700
 And the reason I start there is because we live in a culture

91
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:03,320
 that we're so inoculated to this idea

92
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,900
 that it's almost hard for us to believe

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,000
 that we are really pursuing more and more stuff.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,500
 And the Bible has a name for a group of people

95
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,440
 who pursue accumulating more money and more wealth,

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,960
 greedy.

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,780
 Tonight, we're gonna continue the series Vice and Virtue

98
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,980
 and look at what Jesus says about the topic of greed,

99
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,820
 vice and virtue is essentially where each week

100
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,860
 we've been taking a cultural vice,

101
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,320
 so laziness, entitlement, pride,

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,820
 and covering it with a biblical virtue to replace it with.

103
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,140
 And everyone who came in the room tonight,

104
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,120
 here's the hard thing about greed,

105
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,900
 'cause it's gonna be almost impossible for me

106
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,740
 to convince any of us that we struggle with greed,

107
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
 'cause you're like, I'm not greedy.

108
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,060
 I mean, greedy is like the top billionaires,

109
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,240
 1% out there, taken from everybody else.

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
 They've got a basement full of coins

111
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,240
 that they're just swimming in at night,

112
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,400
 and that's the greedy people.

113
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,440
 That's not me.

114
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,240
 And what we're gonna see is Jesus says

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,600
 that greed has nothing to do with how much you have

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
 and everything to do with your heart.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,520
 And it's complicated by the fact that greed

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
 really is one of those things that hides,

119
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,420
 it's hard to see in the mirror,

120
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,400
 because it hides behind kind of other things

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,480
 or other good things, we would say.

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,680
 Oftentimes, people who are greedy say things like,

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,180
 I'm not greedy, I'm just cautious, okay?

124
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,520
 I'm a saver.

125
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,200
 Or, hey, I'm not greedy, which is, by greed,

126
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,380
 I just mean the desire, the preoccupation

127
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,240
 with accumulating wealth or stuff.

128
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,600
 They'll say things like, dude, I'm not greedy.

129
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,080
 It's like, I was raised poor.

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,380
 I am never going back there.

131
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,940
 I'm gonna make it in life, I'm gonna get more money,

132
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,840
 and I'm gonna set myself up and be successful.

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,520
 Or it'll hide behind anxiety.

134
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,400
 Or it'll hide behind just like, I'm not greedy,

135
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,600
 I just appreciate the finer things in life, okay?

136
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,780
 And it is almost impossible to see in the mirror,

137
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,100
 but the effects that it has are really much easier to see.

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,200
 I mean, people will sacrifice their family

139
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,300
 on the altar of greed.

140
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,480
 They'll sacrifice their marriage.

141
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,120
 And it just looks like working a job

142
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,320
 and pursuing, climbing the corporate ladder,

143
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,980
 they'll sacrifice relationships with their children.

144
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,000
 They sacrifice their health.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,260
 People commit suicide over greed.

146
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,600
 I mean, it is clear, it is causing a wave of destruction.

147
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,200
 And if any people on the planet, and maybe in history,

148
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,840
 are in danger of what Jesus says is an epidemic of the heart

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,600
 that will turn you away from God,

150
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,520
 it's gotta be the richest people

151
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,720
 in the history of the world, which is you and me,

152
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,320
 as Americans.

153
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,520
 And so tonight, we're gonna explore what Jesus says

154
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,660
 about really what is the source of greed

155
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,960
 and what greed is going to lead to,

156
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,280
 and what are the side effects,

157
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,200
 one of the side effects that Jesus points to,

158
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
 and where the solution for greed is.

159
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,120
 So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 12.

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,160
 If you have a Bible, you can flip over to Luke chapter 12.

161
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,460
 If you don't, it'll be up on the screens.

162
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,580
 Luke chapter 12, we'll start in verse 13.

163
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,360
 And let me say one last preface before we dive in.

164
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,200
 Money and church is weird.

165
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,700
 Can we all agree?

166
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,540
 I mean, it just is.

167
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,840
 I mean, if you're here, and maybe you invited a friend

168
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,560
 for the first time, you're like, oh my gosh, really?

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
 I chose the money night?

170
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,840
 My friend finally came with me,

171
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
 and you guys are gonna talk about money?

172
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,720
 'Cause people associate like, oh, the church,

173
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,840
 for whatever reason, God always needs my money.

174
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,280
 We don't ever pass a plate here, we never have,

175
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,480
 we don't want your money.

176
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,200
 And what's challenging as a preacher or a pastor

177
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,400
 is if I talked about money as much as Jesus

178
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,320
 talked about money, no one would come.

179
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,920
 Jesus talked about money, you may not know this,

180
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,880
 more than heaven and hell combined.

181
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,380
 I mean, think about that.

182
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,320
 It was in his top list.

183
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,080
 He talked about money four times

184
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
 as much as he talked about prayer.

185
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,960
 Prayer's a big deal, prayer's important.

186
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,080
 Jesus was like, yeah, let's hit money again.

187
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,440
 'Cause he knew there's something about it

188
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,080
 where unlike nothing else almost,

189
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,600
 it fights for your heart and it fights for my heart.

190
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
 And it can build this like, man,

191
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,040
 I find security and identity in money.

192
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,680
 And so he hits it head on over and over and over again.

193
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
 And so we're gonna hear from him

194
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
 on one of the dangers of it, and we'll start in verse 13.

195
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
 What's going on in Luke chapter 12

196
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,480
 is there's this big crowd that's gathered around Jesus.

197
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
 If you look in verse one of chapter 12,

198
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
 a few verses before, it essentially says

199
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
 thousands of people are gathering around,

200
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,960
 and one of them asks a question of Jesus,

201
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,160
 and it leads to our teaching tonight.

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
 So here we go, verse 13.

203
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,320
 Someone in the crowd said to him, that's Jesus,

204
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,800
 "Teacher, tell my brother to divide

205
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,320
 "the inheritance with me."

206
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,660
 So in this culture, brothers would split the inheritance.

207
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,840
 It was exclusively went to the brothers

208
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,240
 because it was assumed that a sister or a daughter

209
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,720
 would marry into another family

210
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,240
 and receive the inheritance kind of of that brother

211
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,000
 or son, and so the sons were to divide the inheritance.

212
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
 Apparently someone's dad had died,

213
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
 and the older brother was not dividing it

214
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
 according to his younger brother fairly.

215
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,080
 Jesus says this, "Man, who appointed me judge

216
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,520
 "or arbiter between you?"

217
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,480
 Then he said to them, "Watch out.

218
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,400
 "Be on guard against all kinds of greed."

219
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,360
 He says emphatically, hey, you need to be on guard.

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,840
 It's almost like be careful.

221
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,920
 Everyone be on alert and watch out for greed.

222
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
 Why would you have to have such alert?

223
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,960
 Because Jesus knew that greed is one of those things

224
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,040
 that it's so subtle, it's not like other sins.

225
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,540
 It's difficult to see.

226
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,920
 It's not like adultery where you're like,

227
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,600
 I'm not sure, am I committing adultery?

228
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,480
 I'm not sure, that it's difficult to see.

229
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,440
 No one ever comes down, I've never had this conversation

230
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,960
 where somebody comes down front afterwards,

231
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,880
 happens every week, someone will come down front

232
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,500
 and wanna talk about something going on

233
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,560
 that they're walking through their life

234
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,980
 or a struggle that they're having.

235
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,680
 Often they'll be like, hey, can I just pull you aside?

236
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,720
 Can we talk just for a second?

237
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,200
 And never once has anyone ever pulled me aside

238
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,280
 and been like, hey, I just feel like I'm,

239
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,760
 is this okay to talk?

240
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,160
 I feel like I'm struggling with greed.

241
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,120
 And like it never happens.

242
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,880
 People will pull aside and hey, I'm struggling with porn,

243
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,240
 I'm struggling with pot, I'm struggling with insert,

244
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,740
 whatever, but it's almost a sin

245
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,280
 that we really don't even know how to feel guilty about it

246
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,800
 or how to identify it, and Jesus is about to tell us.

247
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,080
 But the second thing he also points to,

248
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,560
 if you notice, is that he says, look,

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,500
 be on guard against all kinds of greed.

250
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,080
 Like there's more than one type of greed, Jesus?

251
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,640
 And he's gonna tell us what that is.

252
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,040
 For life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.

253
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,440
 Verse 16, and then he told them this parable.

254
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,040
 The ground of a certain rich man

255
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,560
 yielded an abundant harvest.

256
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,460
 He thought to himself, what shall I do?

257
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,140
 I have no place to store my crops.

258
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,700
 Then he said, this is what I'll do.

259
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,640
 I will tear down my barns and I will build bigger ones

260
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,600
 and there I will store my surplus grain.

261
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,400
 And I'll say to myself, you have plenty of grain

262
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
 laid up for many years.

263
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,880
 Take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry.

264
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,160
 Now if the story ended right there, if we hit pause,

265
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,120
 if you're sitting out in the audience,

266
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,960
 so basically Jesus says, hey, let me tell you a story.

267
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
 We're gonna talk about greed.

268
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,000
 There's a guy, rich man.

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,280
 Rich man had this crop, or he had a harvest,

270
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,260
 and the crop, I mean, it was incredible.

271
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,620
 This very plentiful harvest, so much so

272
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,780
 that the guy was like, dude, I can retire early.

273
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,180
 I mean, I just made it.

274
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,200
 I've got more than enough to live for the rest of my life,

275
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,040
 so you know what I'll do?

276
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,340
 I need to find a place to put it,

277
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,620
 so I'm gonna tear down my barns, build bigger ones,

278
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,120
 and kick my feet up and take it easy

279
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,960
 for the rest of my life.

280
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,060
 I mean, I have arrived.

281
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,620
 God just blessed me with this incredible crop and harvest.

282
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,380
 And if the story ended there, I mean,

283
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,500
 what do you think his audience is thinking at this point?

284
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,060
 I mean, they're thinking, what would you think

285
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,660
 if you're sitting in an audience and someone's like,

286
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,860
 okay, let me tell you about, there's a rich man.

287
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,940
 He's a billionaire, and all of a sudden,

288
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,540
 his stocks all explode, and God blesses his life,

289
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,900
 and he's millions and millions.

290
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,500
 He never has to work ever again.

291
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,820
 They're thinking what you're thinking.

292
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,740
 Gotta be nice.

293
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,380
 Oh, man, I would love to be that guy.

294
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,380
 That's someone to look up to.

295
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,260
 Maybe he's a role model.

296
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,860
 Is this a parable on retirement?

297
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,540
 And Jesus takes the story in a very different direction.

298
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,780
 Here's what he says next.

299
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,780
 But God said to him, so he's making this story up,

300
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,260
 you fool, this very night,

301
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,060
 your life will be demanded from you.

302
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,620
 Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?

303
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,940
 This is how it will be with whoever stores up things

304
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,300
 for themselves, but is not rich towards God.

305
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,180
 This is the only person or only time in the Bible

306
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,980
 that God calls someone a fool.

307
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,660
 And Jesus looks and he says that the person

308
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,820
 who has really essentially lived the American dream

309
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,540
 has lived a nightmare according to God.

310
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,720
 If you live and spend your entire life like this man,

311
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,100
 pursuing only what is in this life,

312
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,340
 or pursuing being rich only towards yourself

313
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,540
 and not towards God, by being rich towards God,

314
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,940
 Jesus says, or Jesus would elaborate on later,

315
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,040
 is essentially, there's two ways to be rich towards God.

316
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,140
 Give towards the furthering of God's mission,

317
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,280
 which is the ministry of Christ,

318
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,900
 giving out to the world, or giving to the poor.

319
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,620
 He says if you're not rich in that way

320
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,500
 and you spend your whole life just accumulating stuff

321
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,180
 for yourself, you are a fool.

322
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,300
 And he gives us really the first indication

323
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,700
 or the first look at what greed is and the source of greed.

324
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,980
 The source of greed, if you take notes,

325
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,420
 you ran to the source of greed is the consumption assumption.

326
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,860
 Now what does that mean?

327
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,780
 The source of greed is the consumption assumption.

328
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,660
 Here's what the consumption assumption is,

329
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,660
 is that the idea that assumes everything I earn

330
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,320
 is mine to consume.

331
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,700
 The assumption consumption, what's your junction,

332
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,020
 is the idea that everything, it just assumes

333
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,980
 that hey, everything I earn is mine to consume.

334
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,660
 A person who's greedy, Jesus would say,

335
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,340
 is someone who looks at everything that they made last week,

336
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,300
 everything they made last month,

337
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,700
 everything that they have in general,

338
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,320
 and they're like, dude, I work hard, I hate my job,

339
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,820
 I sit there all day and I punch in numbers.

340
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,180
 I earned it and I can spend this however I want to.

341
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,040
 He says that man's a fool when he's greedy.

342
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,460
 Greed, Jesus would say,

343
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,580
 has nothing to do with how much you have.

344
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,700
 I mean, there's a myth that hey, only the richest people

345
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,220
 are greedy, and for only rich people are greedy,

346
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,020
 Jesus would say, no, there's rich people

347
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,780
 who are very not greedy,

348
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,900
 and there's poor people who are greedy.

349
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,020
 You can make $25,000 and be greedy,

350
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,300
 and make a million dollars and not be.

351
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,740
 And the inverse is true.

352
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,340
 Greed has nothing to do with how much you have.

353
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,980
 It has everything to do with what you do

354
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,820
 with what you have.

355
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,940
 And Jesus would say, if you're in this room,

356
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,900
 if you're listening, and you have bought

357
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,380
 the assumption consumption, you assume

358
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,780
 that everything you have has been given to you

359
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,300
 and he says, you are greedy.

360
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,460
 You have bought the lie and you have greed in your heart.

361
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,660
 The idea that everything I have, or that assumes

362
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,660
 everything that I have, everything I've earned is mine.

363
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,220
 God has given for me to consume.

364
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,260
 He says, you are a fool.

365
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,660
 And Jesus says, if you live your life this way,

366
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,540
 where you only pursue things in this life,

367
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,060
 at the end of your life, you will be like this man.

368
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,620
 Will you have, he says, this will be the way it is

369
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,660
 for whoever stores up things for themselves

370
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
 and is not rich towards God.

371
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,060
 He says, the truth of this, that this is that

372
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,020
 at the end of your life, if you live this way,

373
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,420
 you will experience what he experienced,

374
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,060
 total loss, you lose everything.

375
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
 If at the end of this life, all that you've ever

376
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,620
 spent your life devoting is accumulating

377
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,540
 and accumulating stuff, at the end of this life,

378
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,340
 you lose everything, total, it's kinda like,

379
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,820
 yeah, duh, at the end of this life,

380
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,340
 if all you have to show is what you did in this life,

381
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,700
 you never are rich towards God,

382
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,980
 you never give towards others,

383
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,620
 you have experienced total loss.

384
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,540
 Steve Jobs, when Steve Jobs died,

385
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,900
 he left the exact same amount as everyone else

386
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,980
 who died any time around him.

387
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,100
 Everyone else who died that same day,

388
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,180
 everyone else who died around him, which is everything.

389
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,660
 And Jesus says, if you spend this life

390
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,980
 pursuing, getting stuff in this life, you're a fool,

391
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,880
 if you do that exclusively.

392
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,300
 It's almost like, and here's why I think this is so crucial,

393
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,900
 is in America, there's like this cultural message

394
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,980
 that goes out that almost can convince us

395
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,620
 that the goal of life, or what it looks like to win,

396
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,260
 is like playing the game of Monopoly.

397
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,820
 Like, you know how there's multiple types of games,

398
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,100
 when you play games, and certain games are all about,

399
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,540
 hey, how much can you acquire?

400
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,760
 The game of Monopoly, the game of Risk,

401
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,240
 it's about like, hey, spending the game,

402
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,900
 the way you win the game, or at the end of the game,

403
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
 the biggest winner is the one who's accumulated

404
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,840
 and acquired the most stuff.

405
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,320
 Then there's other types of games,

406
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,180
 where the goal of the game, or the objective,

407
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,780
 is not to acquire the most stuff,

408
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,180
 and go around twice, and pass go,

409
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,320
 the objective of the game is to get rid

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,320
 of whatever cards, or whatever tokens that you have,

411
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,420
 and whoever has given away the most at the end of the game

412
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,140
 is the one who wins, or whoever is holding onto the most

413
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,980
 is the one who loses.

414
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,980
 Like, we all know these games, Uno, Speed, BS, Go Fish,

415
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,580
 insert whatever you want in the blank,

416
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
 where the objective of the game,

417
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,340
 in other words, Uno, if you're playing Uno,

418
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,780
 does anyone play Uno anymore?

419
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,460
 If you're playing Uno,

420
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,020
 it's like you wanna get rid of your cards,

421
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,060
 you're not like, oh, I'm taking these,

422
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,900
 and I'm taking these, and I'm taking,

423
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,500
 if you do that, you're like, yeah, you're losing,

424
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,520
 you don't understand the game,

425
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,220
 the objective is, hey, I wanna get rid

426
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,140
 of the cards that I have.

427
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,380
 Jesus says the Christian life is a whole lot more like Uno

428
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,380
 than it is Monopoly, and if you spend your life,

429
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,100
 and I spend my life just chasing, accumulating stuff,

430
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,140
 the goal is to get rid of it.

431
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,540
 If you are holding things at the end of this life,

432
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,700
 it's just wasted potential, he would say.

433
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,120
 And he looked at this man, and he said, you're a fool.

434
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,460
 And then he goes from the source of greed,

435
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,940
 which is bought the lie that everything

436
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,060
 that God has given me is mine,

437
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,180
 like in the last month,

438
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,420
 when you look at the way that you've used

439
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,440
 everything that God has given you, your income,

440
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,300
 whatever your story is, whatever he's put in your hands,

441
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,900
 have you used it exclusively for yourself,

442
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,220
 or have you been rich towards God?

443
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,900
 If you haven't, he would say, there's a good chance

444
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,460
 you're greedy, and it's hard to see,

445
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,580
 but that's what it looks like.

446
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,780
 And then he goes to what greedy leads to,

447
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,820
 or greediness leads to in the next passage.

448
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
 Here's what he says.

449
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,000
 Then Jesus said to his disciples,

450
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,380
 so then he turns from the crowd,

451
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,220
 where he's telling the story,

452
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,060
 and then he just looks at his 12 boys.

453
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,820
 "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life.

454
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,900
 "What you will eat, or about your body,

455
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,440
 "what you will wear, for life is more than food,

456
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,080
 "and body more than clothes.

457
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,580
 "Consider the ravens.

458
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,260
 "They do not sow or reap.

459
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,960
 "They have no storeroom or barn, and yet God feeds them.

460
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,720
 "Are you not much more valuable than birds?

461
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,120
 "Who of you, by worrying, can add a single hour

462
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,260
 "to your life?

463
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,000
 "Since you cannot do this very little thing,

464
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,360
 "why do you worry about the rest?

465
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,240
 "Consider the wildflowers and how they grow.

466
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
 "They don't labor or spin, yet I tell you,

467
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
 "not even Solomon in all of his splendor

468
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,320
 "was dressed like one of these.

469
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,760
 "If that's how God clothes the grass of the field,

470
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,440
 "which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown in the fire,

471
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,020
 "how much more will he clothe you,

472
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,920
 "oh you of little faith?

473
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,660
 "And do not set your heart on what you will eat,

474
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,980
 "or drink, or don't worry about it.

475
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,660
 "For the pagan world runs after all such things,

476
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,180
 "and your father knows that you need them,

477
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,620
 "but seek his kingdom first,

478
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,500
 "and these things will all be given to you as well."

479
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,200
 It almost seems like, man,

480
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,860
 did Jesus just change the subject on us?

481
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,820
 And it's clear that he doesn't,

482
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,220
 if you read back through the text.

483
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,740
 He goes from greed, and the idea of,

484
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,060
 here's what greediness looks like,

485
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,020
 here's the source, it's the consumption assumption,

486
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,380
 hey, whatever I have is mine to consume,

487
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,380
 and he says, "Therefore, do not worry about your life."

488
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,060
 He immediately draws a connection

489
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,160
 between the idea of greed and worry,

490
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,540
 which honestly makes sense when you think about it,

491
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,620
 because there is a connection between greed and worry.

492
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,300
 Greed is the idea that I'm worried,

493
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,340
 hey man, I may not have enough.

494
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,180
 Worry, especially financial worry,

495
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,300
 is the idea that I'm worried I will not have enough.

496
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,620
 And Jesus says, "I just want to invite you to a place

497
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,300
 "where you could experience,

498
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,020
 "in seeking my kingdom first,

499
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,980
 "freedom from financial worry."

500
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,420
 I want you to know that there is a relationship

501
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,520
 between the greed that you have and between worry,

502
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,500
 and I want you to invite,

503
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,660
 or I want to invite you to a place

504
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,420
 where you can experience freedom from financial worry.

505
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,340
 'Cause here's what I know about you,

506
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,180
 'cause I know it about me,

507
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,620
 and I know it really, just 'cause study after study shows it,

508
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,420
 one of the top things that people in general

509
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,640
 are worried about is money.

510
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,620
 Money and future spouse would probably be the two things

511
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,300
 that inside of this room all of us are worried about,

512
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,240
 or those of us who aren't married are worried about.

513
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,700
 And Jesus says, "Hey, I just want you to know,

514
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,380
 "when it comes to the topic of greed,

515
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,520
 "there's a freedom from greed and a freedom from worry

516
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,680
 "that you can experience if you will learn

517
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,160
 "to put or prioritize my kingdom first,

518
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,620
 "my kingdom above your kingdom."

519
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,760
 And he looked out into an audience

520
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,040
 that unlike the worries that we have,

521
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,220
 was not worried about our wants,

522
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,280
 which is really as Americans,

523
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,300
 that's kind of what we worry about.

524
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,860
 Like, "Hey, will I get to upgrade my phone?

525
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,760
 "And can I get a better car?

526
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
 "And where am I gonna live someday?

527
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,540
 "And my kids go to college?"

528
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,380
 We don't worry about like,

529
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,460
 "I don't know if I'm gonna get a meal later today.

530
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,840
 "I don't know if there's gonna be water for me.

531
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,940
 "I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight."

532
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,500
 That may be the case for very few of us

533
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,060
 inside of the room, but by and large,

534
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,080
 most of us aren't like,

535
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,960
 "Gosh, I'm just storing up those Arca bottles

536
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,380
 "'cause I'm worried I'm never gonna have a drink again."

537
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,000
 Most of us worry about the wants we have.

538
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,940
 He looks into an audience that's worried about like,

539
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,880
 "Jesus, our clothes are wearing out."

540
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,040
 And he says, "There is a place

541
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,640
 "that God wants to bring you to,

542
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,660
 "wherein, seeking his kingdom first,

543
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,200
 "you will experience freedom from worry."

544
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,240
 Freedom from worry.

545
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,000
 The side effect of greed is anxiety.

546
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,160
 The second point that we have tonight

547
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,840
 that Jesus leads us to in his teachings

548
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,120
 is that there's a side effect that comes from greed,

549
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,460
 and it is anxiety.

550
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,520
 And here's how I think, generally speaking,

551
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,800
 like anxiety plays out for most of us

552
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,820
 inside of our life.

553
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,600
 Is for those of us who are financially anxious,

554
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
 because it is related to our wants,

555
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,480
 and I think there's legitimately people

556
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,240
 who are financially anxious inside of the room,

557
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,820
 it generally happens, here's like the road

558
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,400
 that we experience anxiety on,

559
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,080
 is that you make a certain amount of money,

560
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,040
 you make $40,000, you make $80,000,

561
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,560
 you make 50,000, whatever it is,

562
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,640
 and regardless of kinda how much you make,

563
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,120
 the line that you draw for your spending

564
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,080
 is right up, and sometimes even right above,

565
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,440
 whatever salary that you make, or whatever I make.

566
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
 I mean, it just goes without saying,

567
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,180
 the average American kinda does this,

568
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,340
 where hey, if I make 50,000,

569
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,600
 I end up spending almost exactly up to $50,000.

570
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,160
 And so, of course I have anxiety,

571
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,880
 because it's an anxiety-filled place

572
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,960
 to live at the limit of my money.

573
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,840
 And Jesus says, if you allow greed,

574
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,320
 or excessive consumption, because again,

575
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,640
 I think there's resistance to being like,

576
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,760
 dude, I'm not greedy.

577
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,400
 If you are someone who is spending

578
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,960
 every single dollar that you have

579
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,460
 that's coming into your hands,

580
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,940
 you are someone that Jesus would say

581
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,720
 is being driven by excessive consumption,

582
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,640
 and of course you're gonna experience anxiety.

583
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,340
 And if you will learn to seek my kingdom first,

584
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,940
 you will have less anxiety.

585
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,760
 And I think, let's just talk real.

586
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,180
 Inside of the room right now,

587
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,660
 the emotional response to this is,

588
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,620
 dude, are you kidding me?

589
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,720
 We're talking about money right now,

590
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,460
 and you're telling me I need to put God first,

591
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,820
 and be rich towards God, and give towards his kingdom,

592
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,740
 and seek his kingdom first,

593
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,260
 and I am barely making it.

594
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,460
 That sounds great for you up there, preacher boy,

595
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,260
 but pretty much all this is going in this year,

596
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,180
 and out this year, and I'm like,

597
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,980
 really, you got the God wants my money again,

598
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,260
 and the church, what?

599
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,460
 This place feels pretty nice, and I'm barely making it.

600
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,340
 And so I've got like a car lease that I have,

601
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,780
 I have an apartment that I have to pay for,

602
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,380
 I have bills that I have to pay,

603
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,480
 and I'm like, I'm drowning over here,

604
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,820
 and you're telling me that in the midst of everything

605
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,300
 that I have on my expenditures,

606
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,780
 I'm supposed to somehow be like,

607
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,820
 man, prioritize God first, and make sure that you,

608
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,740
 when it comes to your money,

609
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,220
 you're spending towards his kingdom, above and beyond.

610
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,940
 That sounds amazing, but there's only one problem.

611
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,300
 I can't afford it.

612
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,980
 And so if you will just talk to God,

613
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,500
 or maybe God, you can just hear me now,

614
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,780
 and you'll give me more money,

615
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,460
 I would love to be generous towards you and to your kingdom.

616
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,860
 I would love to give you money,

617
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,180
 and seek your kingdom first, and prioritize it above mine,

618
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,700
 but right now, I just can't do it,

619
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,980
 because I don't have enough money.

620
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,180
 And Jesus would say, the problem is,

621
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,060
 and you're not gonna believe me,

622
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,900
 that it's not a lack of money.

623
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,940
 It's not that you need more money.

624
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,580
 It's that you have to put his kingdom first.

625
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,280
 And the truth and reality, even study after study shows,

626
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,620
 if you were to get more money,

627
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,860
 you're like, hey, I make 50 grand.

628
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,380
 If I made 70 grand, I would love to be generous towards God

629
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,620
 and put his kingdom first.

630
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,900
 Study after study shows that whenever someone

631
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,900
 goes from 50 to 70, their lifestyle just moves up with it.

632
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,740
 It's almost like this.

633
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,740
 Like, here would be the illustration

634
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,460
 that may help bring some clarity to it.

635
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,900
 Whenever it comes to, like, our spending,

636
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,340
 let's say this is our income.

637
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,380
 So whatever your income is, if it's $20,000, $50,000,

638
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,220
 let's say it's $30,000.

639
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,260
 Generally speaking, when it comes to what's in,

640
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,940
 what we're using our income towards,

641
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,000
 and if we have, over here, it's things for ourself.

642
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,380
 This would be your rent.

643
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,740
 This would be your cell phone.

644
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,940
 This would be a combination kind of of needs,

645
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,580
 and of, you know, let's just be honest, wants.

646
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,140
 This is like, hey, I, you know, have a car.

647
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,340
 I have insurance to pay for.

648
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,940
 This is a, I got in a wreck last week,

649
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,060
 and I just have all these different things

650
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,540
 that I'm mounting up, and I'm trying to pay for,

651
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,060
 and this is my Netflix subscription.

652
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,420
 Let's just insert any of those things

653
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,060
 that don't fill in giving towards God and His kingdom.

654
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,640
 And so really, when it comes to our income,

655
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,460
 the reality is most of us feel like,

656
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,020
 dude, I'm doing everything I can,

657
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,620
 and it's overflowing right now.

658
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,620
 Like, I'm not just drowning in my own income.

659
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,260
 I'm reaching into the future.

660
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,140
 I'm not just drowning in trying to make ends meet

661
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,020
 with the income that I have.

662
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,380
 Like, I'm having, I have $3,000 in credit card debt.

663
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,660
 I don't have enough, and you're coming over here,

664
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,200
 and if this represents God, and you're like,

665
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,640
 dude, you should really try to like jam those in there

666
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,680
 a little bit more.

667
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,980
 It's just not gonna happen, okay?

668
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,240
 And what Jesus is saying is that if you will learn

669
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,460
 to prioritize my kingdom first, what do I mean by that?

670
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,340
 Do I just mean, hey, if you will tithe

671
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,100
 and have an automatic withdrawal,

672
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,020
 then all of your money problems are gonna go away?

673
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:57,020
 No, if you will learn how to prioritize my kingdom first,

674
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,060
 it's going to shape everything that you put,

675
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,740
 or every other part of the income that you use.

676
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,420
 So whenever your life posture is,

677
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,500
 hey, God, at the end of the day,

678
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,900
 my life is here to seek your kingdom first, not my kingdom.

679
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,300
 My life, my money, everything is for your kingdom.

680
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,460
 Jesus says when you begin to live that way,

681
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,400
 begin to think that way, begin to use your money that way,

682
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,540
 something begins to change,

683
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,380
 and it will then become a filter

684
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,620
 that the posture of your life and your heart,

685
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,620
 'cause you're like, I'm here,

686
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,820
 and again, I'm not saying tithe,

687
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,020
 and I'm not saying, hey, if you give,

688
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,460
 all your money problems are gonna away.

689
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,300
 What I'm saying is Jesus is saying

690
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,100
 if you begin to seek my kingdom first,

691
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,840
 you will have less anxiety

692
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,720
 because you will not spend all the way up to the limit.

693
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,200
 And again, I'm not saying if you tithe,

694
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,380
 you won't spend all the way to the limit.

695
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,820
 There's plenty of people who tithe

696
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,940
 who are terrible with money

697
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,480
 and max out their credit cards every single month.

698
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,560
 People who begin to say, God, everything I have is yours.

699
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,180
 And so I'm seeing through the filter of your kingdom come.

700
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,620
 I'm seeking your kingdom with my life.

701
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,100
 And so every decision as it relates

702
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,340
 to what purse I'm gonna buy,

703
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,180
 what car I'm gonna drive, where I'm gonna live,

704
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,220
 everything I'm gonna be,

705
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,180
 everything's gonna be touched and impacted

706
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,700
 by the fact that above everything else,

707
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,640
 I'm here to seek your kingdom.

708
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,860
 And that may look like you giving $1 a million dollars.

709
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,000
 I don't know what that's gonna look like,

710
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,140
 but if you can come to a place

711
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,980
 where you truly, Jesus says, do that,

712
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,900
 you'll have less anxiety, you'll have less worry,

713
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,420
 you'll have more money and more margin,

714
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,740
 and you will experience freedom from greed.

715
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,300
 Or you can live like everyone else does

716
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,740
 and you will max yourself out

717
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,580
 and you live in a culture

718
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,100
 that is trying to get you to max out.

719
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,300
 I mean, think about the credit card industry

720
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,940
 where they're like, hey, let's reach into June

721
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,340
 and get it on loan and you can use the money.

722
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,620
 You're good for it, right?

723
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,300
 And you'll be in golden handcuffs until you pay it off.

724
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,700
 And Jesus is saying, I want you to be at a place

725
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,300
 where you put my kingdom first,

726
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,540
 you put the rocks of being rich towards God in,

727
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,960
 and everything else will be impacted

728
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,520
 in your life and in mine.

729
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,300
 And if not, you will experience the side effect of greed,

730
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,300
 that excessive desire for more, which is anxiety.

731
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,380
 Anxiety.

732
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,380
 He then goes into really the clearest solution

733
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,820
 as it relates to greed in verse 32.

734
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,620
 Do not be afraid, little flock.

735
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,800
 Oh, it's just funny.

736
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,420
 (laughing)

737
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,900
 What are we, pastor?

738
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,700
 For your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.

739
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,580
 So he says, seek first his kingdom

740
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
 and then know as you do so, don't be afraid.

741
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,540
 And here's what that looks like.

742
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,340
 So sell your possessions, give them to the poor,

743
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,300
 provide for yourselves purses or money

744
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,740
 for yourselves that will not wear out,

745
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,540
 treasure in heaven that will never fail,

746
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,020
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.

747
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,300
 For wherever your treasure is,

748
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,180
 there your heart will be also.

749
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,180
 Jesus says that greed ultimately can be resolved

750
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,900
 and is resolved, there is a solution for it.

751
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,340
 But it comes whenever you begin to generously give

752
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,000
 towards God's kingdom, something happens in your heart.

753
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,300
 Your heart begins to shift.

754
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,820
 He just said, hey, wherever your treasure is,

755
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,860
 your heart's gonna be there also.

756
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,820
 We live in a culture that says,

757
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,780
 put your money where your mouth is.

758
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,780
 Jesus says, you will put your money where your heart is.

759
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,860
 And your heart will shift.

760
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,660
 There's something where greed begins to be remedied

761
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,960
 and a solution is given for greed

762
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,860
 whenever you begin to give and be rich towards God.

763
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,260
 Our third idea from this text

764
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,720
 is the solution to greed is storing in eternity.

765
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,580
 Jesus just said, hey, look, I'm telling you,

766
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,040
 the God who is there in heaven

767
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,620
 wants to give to anyone who will trust him.

768
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,480
 Anyone who's willing to invest in his kingdom,

769
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,140
 he wants to generously give it to you, little flock.

770
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,240
 And so invest, sell your stuff, give it to the poor,

771
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,080
 give towards God's kingdom

772
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,120
 and store up for yourselves treasure that will never fade,

773
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,340
 that will never wear out.

774
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,980
 It's the safest place you can use and invest

775
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,580
 any money that you have, he says to his crowd.

776
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,140
 And he would say to you and he would say to me.

777
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,780
 Essentially, Jesus is given like insider trading information

778
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,940
 and this life, you go to jail for it.

779
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,500
 Jesus is saying, and the next, it's A-okay

780
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,700
 and I'm telling you, you want to go all in with your money.

781
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:21,340
 Here's why I think most of us don't.

782
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,260
 Most of us don't really like radically give

783
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,020
 or have a posture of like, dude, whatever I have,

784
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,220
 even if I don't have very much right now,

785
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,480
 I made $1,000 this month, but I really wanna make sure

786
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,300
 that I'm investing something in eternity.

787
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,820
 At the end of the day, the reason why we don't

788
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,440
 is not because we don't have enough money.

789
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,500
 And that's kind of like the felt need

790
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,700
 or the smoke screen we hide behind.

791
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,580
 The reason why we don't is faith.

792
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,380
 I mean, that's the reason why I don't.

793
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,100
 Like if I really believe like Jesus,

794
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,180
 anything you tell me, like any dollar that I give,

795
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,940
 anything that I sacrifice for your kingdom,

796
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,540
 there's gonna be an eternal reward

797
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,920
 that awaits me forever and ever.

798
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,020
 I mean, if I really, if that really gripped

799
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,920
 and I was without any doubt convinced of it,

800
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,280
 how would that change the way that I spend?

801
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,860
 I'm a pastor.

802
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,940
 And Jesus says, man, the moment you,

803
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,180
 the more you begin to believe that,

804
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,860
 the more it's gonna change and shape

805
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,080
 because if you will come to really grasping that,

806
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,340
 you will understand that it is the safest place

807
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,220
 that you can put your money.

808
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,780
 Here's why I know that it's a moment of faith.

809
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,380
 I mean, think about, let me use a dumb illustration.

810
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,540
 So most likely if you're in this room,

811
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,780
 you've heard about Bitcoin.

812
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,760
 Bitcoin, anyone know what Bitcoin is?

813
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,140
 Okay, Bitcoin, apparently I'm the only one.

814
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,440
 So let me educate everybody.

815
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,100
 Bitcoin apparently is like this sort of cryptocurrency

816
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,500
 that sounds like it's out of Star Wars

817
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,780
 and it's some sort of, I don't even fully grasp it,

818
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,260
 I won't even attempt to because somebody's

819
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,180
 gonna come up after and be like,

820
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,500
 actually, sure, there's actually a statistical analysis.

821
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,500
 Anyways, okay, so Bitcoin is somehow this cryptocurrency

822
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,140
 or people think, oh man, this could be a currency

823
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,540
 of the future, it's a one world currency.

824
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,940
 I don't personally own any Bitcoin,

825
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,420
 this is not a sponsorship ploy.

826
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,500
 It is this money or sense of currency

827
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,840
 that some people think, oh man, this is the future,

828
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,260
 you should invest in this, it's gonna explode.

829
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,780
 It's the future of money.

830
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,420
 If I really believed or if you really believed,

831
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,220
 if someone came from the future and they said,

832
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,420
 they came and they were like, dude, hey,

833
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,220
 I'm from the future, I'm the future you,

834
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,340
 I need to talk to you about Bitcoin

835
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,460
 in a very short amount of time,

836
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,620
 all American money will be worthless.

837
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,340
 Literally, it'll just be what it is,

838
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,060
 little green pieces of paper with dead presidents on it.

839
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,740
 No one will use it for anything.

840
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,100
 Bitcoin is the future.

841
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,060
 You want to go all in right now on Bitcoin.

842
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,900
 I'm telling you, I'm promising you,

843
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,260
 if you really were like, man, this guy's wearing

844
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,300
 a shiny suit, he's from the future, I guess,

845
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,060
 and I really think that this is gonna happen,

846
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,500
 Bitcoin is gonna be the future if you really,

847
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,580
 like you were convinced of it, follow me,

848
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,460
 what would you do?

849
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,500
 You'd go all in with Bitcoin.

850
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,380
 I mean, if you were convinced that like,

851
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,820
 all of the money in my bank account

852
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,340
 is gonna be like monopoly money.

853
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
 And Bitcoin is really, I mean, I should trade

854
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,300
 that stuff that is losing its value

855
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,480
 and not gonna be worth anything and go all in

856
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,840
 on what I know 'cause I have future information

857
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,460
 is going to be worth exponentially more.

858
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,580
 I mean, of course you would.

859
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,320
 You'd be like crazy if not.

860
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,200
 Jesus is saying that that is what's gonna happen.

861
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,300
 And right now, you need to eat, you need to live indoors,

862
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,100
 you need to have all those different needs,

863
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,660
 if you will, met, but there's gonna come a day

864
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,540
 much sooner than you and I think where everything

865
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
 that is passed through your hands will either be something

866
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,180
 that you stewarded for an eternal reward

867
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,780
 or it will be something you're just left holding

868
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,660
 in the end and lose and me too.

869
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,420
 And this is not a, man, the church here,

870
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,940
 we're gonna ask and pass a plate at the end

871
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,300
 'cause we need your money.

872
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,100
 God doesn't need your money, we don't need your money

873
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,460
 and not because like, we're like, dude,

874
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,900
 we got a vault back there, it's huge, it's unbelievable.

875
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,500
 I mean, we're, not because of that,

876
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,200
 because I wanna make sure inside of this room,

877
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,200
 nobody hides behind the smoke screen of thinking,

878
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,640
 oh my gosh, the church just wants my money again

879
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,800
 and you use that to talk yourself out

880
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,720
 of the best financial advice you could receive,

881
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,020
 which is from Jesus saying, invest in my kingdom.

882
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,220
 Every other kingdom that you invest in is fading away.

883
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,480
 It will not last.

884
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,160
 The solution for greed is investing,

885
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,860
 it's storing up in eternity.

886
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,440
 So here's what I'm gonna press.

887
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,120
 If you are a member of a church, not this church,

888
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,040
 any church, if you are a member, you're all in,

889
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,960
 I'm not talking to non-believers,

890
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,240
 I'm not talking to people who are like, you know,

891
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,640
 still trying to figure out the faith thing

892
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,680
 or just, you know, just starting to take steps

893
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,400
 in that direction, if you are a member of a church,

894
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,100
 you should be giving regularly somewhere to Christ's kingdom.

895
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,580
 You should be giving somewhere.

896
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,760
 If you, whatever home church you're at,

897
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,600
 I'm not telling you to give it here,

898
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,760
 if you go to another church, you should give to that church

899
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,520
 that all of us, if you're a follower of Christ

900
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,880
 and you're all in with Jesus,

901
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,620
 you should be connected to a local body

902
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,320
 and you should be contributing there

903
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,320
 or contributing to Christ's mission in some sense.

904
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,640
 So if you're like, can I give to a missionary?

905
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
 Sure, give to a missionary, give to anything

906
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,920
 that's gonna spread the mission of Christ

907
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,420
 or Jesus says, you can give directly to the poor.

908
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,800
 That you and I should be regularly contributing

909
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,960
 and giving towards God's kingdom.

910
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,600
 What do I mean by regularly giving towards God's kingdom?

911
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,000
 With regularity, you should be giving

912
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,140
 towards God's kingdom.

913
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,160
 That means every two weeks, every week,

914
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,600
 whatever that looks like, maybe it's annually,

915
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,480
 maybe it's quarterly, I don't know what,

916
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
 you know, how that would work for you.

917
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,200
 But I know that as I was preparing this week,

918
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,640
 I felt a check because I don't think

919
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,560
 that I've waived this banner hard enough

920
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,480
 for young adults here.

921
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,160
 And I felt like I was not putting in front of them

922
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,440
 the best investment advice that they could ever have

923
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,860
 because I was like, man, I just don't have much money,

924
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,680
 I don't wanna create insecurity and create people

925
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,600
 being like, oh, I guess church wants my money.

926
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,240
 And I needed to repent because it's not loving to you,

927
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,120
 it's not loving to anyone who claims the name of Jesus

928
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,960
 to say, look, there's an eternal reward.

929
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,800
 Anything that you give in this life,

930
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,040
 anything that you sacrifice will be something

931
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,480
 that forever and ever and ever,

932
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,320
 Christ is saying you'll be repaid a hundredfold.

933
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,880
 I mean, that's crazy.

934
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,960
 And for me to hide behind like, gosh,

935
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,280
 I just don't wanna give people the wrong impression

936
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,200
 is stupid and wrong on my part.

937
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,320
 And so you do with that whatever you want to.

938
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
 Jesus says, you invest in my kingdom,

939
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,520
 it's the only place that's safe.

940
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,480
 Bitcoin's not, the American dollar's not,

941
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,280
 whatever Apple stock, Bezos' stock,

942
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,960
 none of it is gonna last.

943
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
 The only kingdom that will last is mine.

944
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,020
 And so if you are a believer,

945
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,400
 I want to not challenge or encourage you or guilt you,

946
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,080
 I want to give you like the best advice you're gonna get.

947
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,200
 You should be investing in the only kingdom

948
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,960
 that lasts regularly.

949
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,080
 And so if you have a home church,

950
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,560
 I would incredibly encourage you,

951
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,920
 you should be investing in your home church.

952
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,840
 And Jesus says, you will never regret it.

953
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,160
 How much should I be investing?

954
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,840
 I think the answer is probably based on what I read,

955
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,120
 you tell me what you read,

956
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,960
 how much do you wanna have in heaven?

957
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,640
 I mean, at the end of the day,

958
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,600
 it's not, is it dollar for dollar?

959
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,880
 I don't think so, 'cause Jesus says with the widow's mite,

960
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,960
 hey, this woman who gave her one coin,

961
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,040
 she only had one, gave more than everybody else.

962
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,800
 And so there's something, clearly Jesus says like,

963
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,320
 dude, if you only have one coin,

964
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,760
 like you're in here like, I only have one coin,

965
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,360
 Jesus is like, dude, you should go all in,

966
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,160
 'cause you get 80 times more than any of the rest of us.

967
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,560
 And I'm so angry, I'm throwing my papers up here.

968
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,920
 (congregation laughing)

969
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,720
 You guys just talk amongst yourselves for a second here.

970
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,200
 This is gonna be really good.

971
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,000
 So you should be given regularly.

972
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,320
 (congregation laughing)

973
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:00,280
 Man, it's always terrible, you kill a moment, Shane.

974
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,320
 It's the worst.

975
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,120
 To some ministry or to some church.

976
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,960
 Should I give if I'm in debt?

977
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
 If I have student loans?

978
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,280
 Man, I don't know, you should have a community group

979
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,320
 around you who helps walk you through that.

980
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,960
 Where should I give?

981
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,960
 Towards Christ's kingdom, either a ministry or a church,

982
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,760
 or towards directly towards the poor.

983
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,120
 Jesus said it's ultimately an issue

984
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,320
 if you're unwilling to give,

985
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,640
 your hands are gripped around it,

986
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
 which I know a lot of you guys are gonna leave here tonight,

987
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,960
 you're not gonna do anything with what I'm saying.

988
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,840
 And you're gonna miss out.

989
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,080
 And you're gonna continue investing

990
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,200
 and building your own kingdom.

991
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,160
 And Jesus says, man, the problem ultimately

992
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,680
 is a matter of the heart.

993
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,520
 And the good news is, the more you give,

994
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,920
 the more greed's grip gets released.

995
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,320
 It's just something that happens.

996
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,880
 'Cause where your treasure is, your heart will follow.

997
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,480
 The source of greed is the idea of assuming

998
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,120
 that everything I have is mine to consume.

999
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,360
 What greed is gonna lead to in your life,

1000
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,400
 and the reason why many of you are experiencing it right now

1001
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,240
 is anxiety.

1002
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,320
 And the solution for greed, the freedom from the grip

1003
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,080
 of greed comes from giving, from storing up in eternity.

1004
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
 Jesus would say.

1005
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,240
 I'll close here.

1006
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,160
 When I was younger, my family,

1007
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,160
 I had cousins that had a condo in Seaside, in Destin,

1008
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,480
 in Florida, and we would go.

1009
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,000
 And I remember staying at the condo,

1010
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
 and I was like seven years old, and you wake up,

1011
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,040
 and there are all kinds of different fun things

1012
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,360
 about the condo that I won't go into.

1013
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,560
 But one thing that you do, I had three siblings,

1014
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,440
 and so of course, if you are on a beach,

1015
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,880
 and you're not ever really at the beach,

1016
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,800
 you run down, if you're like, oh, I'm gonna run down.

1017
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,120
 And you're like, oh, I'm gonna run down.

1018
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,440
 And if you're not ever really at the beach,

1019
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,800
 you run down, if you're a little kid,

1020
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
 and you begin to do what?

1021
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,840
 You begin to build sandcastles.

1022
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,360
 And so you take whatever kind of tools and resources,

1023
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,400
 and this cup, and this bucket, and these knives,

1024
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,200
 and anything that was at the house, this plate,

1025
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,440
 and you begin to build whatever sort of ultimate sandcastle

1026
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,280
 that you can.

1027
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,480
 You're building a moat around,

1028
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,040
 and your imagination's going wild,

1029
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,200
 so there's fireproof alligators in the moat

1030
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,720
 that are driving around, and you're pouring water in,

1031
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,640
 and you're looking at your siblings,

1032
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,560
 and you're kicking over their tower,

1033
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,000
 and you're just building it,

1034
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,120
 and you spend the entire day building

1035
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,680
 this incredible, elaborate sandcastle,

1036
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,360
 this incredible thing, this home.

1037
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,680
 And then what happens the next day is you go to sleep,

1038
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,100
 and because to make a sandcastle,

1039
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,000
 it's gotta be close somewhat to the water

1040
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,720
 in order to get the right consistency,

1041
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,360
 and keep things compact.

1042
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,460
 You go outside, and it's gone.

1043
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,000
 'Cause the tide comes in, and it sweeps it away.

1044
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,200
 And you do it again, and it doesn't last.

1045
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,240
 What Jesus says is that your life,

1046
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,300
 if all that you're spending it on is this life,

1047
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,440
 you are building a sandcastle,

1048
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,440
 and it's gonna be here today, and it will be gone tomorrow.

1049
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,880
 And just as crazy as it would be for someone to go out

1050
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,220
 and be like, this is where I'm gonna sleep,

1051
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,200
 I'm making this sandcastle,

1052
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,920
 I'm putting all of this energy into it,

1053
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,240
 Jesus would say, you're a fool,

1054
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,040
 and you're a sandcastle king, or a sandcastle queen,

1055
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,740
 but you are wasting your life.

1056
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,460
 But if you will seek the only kingdom,

1057
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,360
 it's not your kingdom, it's not my kingdom,

1058
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,480
 and at the end of the day, you and I,

1059
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,260
 that's the fact, as silly, as dumb

1060
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,320
 as that illustration may be,

1061
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,700
 you'll be a sandcastle king,

1062
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,100
 or you'll live for his kingdom, that's the truth.

1063
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,480
 And Jesus says, will you invest in my kingdom,

1064
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,420
 it's the only one that will last,

1065
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,120
 with your money, with your time,

1066
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,440
 will you put me first, and prioritize me,

1067
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,360
 or are you gonna be a sandcastle king or queen?

1068
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,680
 Let me pray.

1069
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:57,600
 Father, I need your help as much as anyone in this room.

1070
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,600
 I live in one of the most materialistic cities in our world,

1071
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,440
 and every single day, I feel the tension and the lie,

1072
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,220
 and just the message fighting from my heart

1073
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,980
 that I don't have enough, I need more,

1074
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,540
 I need more stuff, I need more money,

1075
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,180
 like that would fix my problems,

1076
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,460
 would you help me, God, to not waste my life

1077
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,460
 building sandcastles, building my own kingdom,

1078
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,980
 consumed about where my kids are gonna go to school,

1079
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,040
 what house I'm gonna live in,

1080
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,340
 what kind of car I'm gonna drive,

1081
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,900
 how much I'm gonna have in my 401k,

1082
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,900
 how much I'm making, and not waste my life, God.

1083
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,100
 And I sit before a room of young adults

1084
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,460
 who honestly, many of them are wasting their life,

1085
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,020
 and they're running after any kingdom but yours,

1086
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,340
 or they're running after their own, let's be honest.

1087
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,340
 And the same thing is fighting from my heart, Lord,

1088
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,920
 would you help that to not be the case today,

1089
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,460
 but even if it isn't today,

1090
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,940
 I'll run after my kingdom tomorrow,

1091
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,800
 so God, we need your help, Lord.

1092
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,500
 (gentle music)

1093
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,040
 Would you please help us to see with an eternal perspective

1094
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,520
 and store treasures in heaven,

1095
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,080
 and be radically generous, Lord,

1096
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,960
 and trust that as you say,

1097
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,200
 anything given for your kingdom

1098
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,800
 will have eternal reward,

1099
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,960
 and anything held onto will be eternal regret,

1100
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,840
 Father, thank you for dying in our place,

1101
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,800
 for giving your life,

1102
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,960
 for being the God who was rich,

1103
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,440
 who for our sake became poor.

1104
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,320
 You are worthy of every dollar we make,

1105
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,120
 everything that we do, every breath that we breathe,

1106
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,200
 every song that we sing,

1107
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,520
 and we worship you now in song, amen.

1108
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:52,520
