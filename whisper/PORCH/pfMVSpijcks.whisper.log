[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.500]   (phone dialing)
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.300]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.980]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.060]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.540]   - Hey yo, Danny!
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.220]   Where are you at, bro?
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.020]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.140]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.500]   but I feel like the word keeps putting you back
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.740]   on my heart for a reason.
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.420]   So please call me back.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.780]   - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.100]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.580]   She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.980]   So hit me back, love you, bro.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.780]   - No, I'm sure this is the right number,
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.700]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.620]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.820]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.620]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.940]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.380]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.400]   - Well, porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.300]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.640]   Man, I don't know, we kind of gotten used to this
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.860]   over the past couple of weeks,
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.040]   but this is special, what's happening in this room.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.320]   Some of you are like, yeah, I like a little elbow room,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.060]   and I haven't had any this summer, what's going on?
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.880]   And it's not just in this room,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.120]   it's people tuning in all over the country online.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.320]   It's our overflow that's packed out.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.880]   Welcome to the overflow, we love you guys.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880]   And all of our Porch Live locations,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.280]   shout out to Springfield, to Midland, and to Boise, Idaho,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.640]   the land of the potatoes.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.920]   Hey, we're so, so glad that you're here.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.280]   Hey, if you have a Bible,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.020]   go ahead and open your Bible to the book of Luke.
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.940]   We're gonna be in Luke chapter 22 tonight.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.840]   Well, when my wife and I were dating,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.520]   my wife's name is Jen, when we were dating,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.940]   we literally, I'm not kidding with you,
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.760]   we had no conflict during the time that we dated, zero.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.240]   And it was like concerning to us.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.520]   We were like, man, we would ask friends and mentors,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.240]   like, we never fight, like we just never, we've tried.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.560]   We've tried to be like, I think that looks weird,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.360]   and it's like, ha ha, we laugh, we just don't fight.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.800]   And I remember one time going to a mentor in particular,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.360]   and a mentor couple, and saying,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.080]   hey, is it weird that we never fight?
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.320]   And they said, no, y'all will probably never fight.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.840]   We never fight, y'all will never fight.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.540]   And we're like, awesome, high five, this is great.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.180]   And so we get engaged, and we get married,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.580]   and we go on the honeymoon, and we come back,
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.460]   and it's bliss for two weeks.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.220]   And then we start fighting,
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.780]   like conflict started in our relationship.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.380]   And there was one morning in particular that just,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.720]   it especially, that the conflict just really boiled up.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.020]   And I remember my wife, she was a teacher up in Frisco,
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.120]   and I was a youth pastor out in Grapevine.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.020]   And I remember I was supposed to go
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.860]   to a conference in Austin, and I was running late,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.600]   and she was running late, and we're just having a fight,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.060]   like a legitimate fight.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.980]   And finally, she just leaves,
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.100]   kind of, she's frustrated, leaves the house,
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.300]   and I go, and I'm getting my stuff together real quick,
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.380]   and then it hits me, oh no, I don't have my phone.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.040]   And I don't see Jen's phone.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.040]   She took both of our phones with her to work.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.100]   'Cause we had the same cover, and whatever,
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.460]   we've changed that.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.180]   And she took both, and I remember,
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.820]   guys, I'm just being real with you,
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.720]   I remember in that moment thinking in my head,
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.660]   if we were dating, I would break up with her, right now.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.580]   That's a weird feeling to have when you're married.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.060]   And I knew, no, I made a covenant,
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.820]   like I'm in this thing, and I'm just being honest,
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.980]   I felt stuck two weeks in to my young marriage.
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.500]   And I remember, in that moment,
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.340]   I'm wallowing in the midst of my self-pity,
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.820]   I remember it felt like I heard from God,
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.820]   "Tyler, your real marriage starts right now.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.240]   "I don't care about all those vows you said,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.640]   "I know that was nice, it's this moment now
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.240]   "where you look at your bride, and you say,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.060]   "Regardless of what I'm feeling, I choose you, I love you."
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.540]   And what God did in that moment is peeled back for me
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.020]   a pattern in my life.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.980]   When things got hard in my dating relationships,
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.060]   I tended to run.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.980]   And part of that was my personality,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.260]   part of that was growing up in a big family, five kids,
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.500]   when things would get chaotic,
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.620]   I'd just run to my room and kind of get away.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.220]   And now in my young marriage,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.660]   God was forcing me to deal with me.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.520]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.460]   Because we're in the midst of this series
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.360]   called "We Need to Talk,"
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.880]   where we're covering some of the topics,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.900]   the questions that you guys have asked
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.780]   about dating and relationships
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.240]   that most people don't talk about it,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.980]   but we're talking about it here.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.100]   And tonight we're talking about the topic in particular,
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.040]   why does this keep happening to me?
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.100]   And I'll be honest, when I heard that topic,
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.860]   we were going through all the different questions,
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.860]   when I heard it, I had some mixed feelings.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.420]   I know many of you have asked this very question,
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.940]   looking at the horizon of your dating life and going,
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.340]   why does this keep happening to me?
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.400]   And there's one part of me that loves that question.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.780]   Because it's forcing you to look at your situation
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.940]   dead in the face and going, what is going on?
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.260]   And looking at yourself and going,
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.020]   why do I keep ending up in these toxic relationships?
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.780]   Why do I know there's nothing but trouble for me,
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.780]   but yet that text at 1 a.m., I see it buzz,
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.700]   and all of a sudden, like a gravitational pull,
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.500]   I start reaching out, we get back together,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.060]   I know it's destructive, but it's pulling me in.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.900]   Why does this keep happening?
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.260]   Some of you is, why do I keep leading people on?
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.300]   Like I'm just trying to be friends,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.700]   and then all of a sudden we're just goofing off,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.340]   hanging out, and then I get another text,
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.440]   and it says, hey, can we go to coffee?
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.380]   And we sit down, and it's a broken heart.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.700]   On the other side, as I go, I'm just, I'm sorry,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.380]   I thought we were just friends.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.900]   Some of you, it's you're stuck in sexual sin,
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.920]   and you thought you had made it through
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.540]   just to see that thing rearing its ugly head again.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.980]   Others of you, it's that you finally found someone
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.760]   that actually is interested in you,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.380]   and now your family and your friends
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.500]   and your community disapprove,
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.340]   and you're going, why, why?
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.480]   See, this is a good question to ask,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.700]   but on the other side,
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.100]   if I'm just being completely honest with you,
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.700]   this question, why does this keep happening to me,
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.860]   it just reeks of victim mentality.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.980]   Of just looking at yourself going, why me?
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.740]   It's everything's going on to me,
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.260]   and I'm concerned, honestly,
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.420]   for some of you who everybody, the world is against you,
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.740]   and why is this happening?
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.560]   And if I was sitting down at coffee with you,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.540]   and you were bemoaning about your situation
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.380]   and your problem,
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.500]   I would start to ask some questions to diagnose this.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.440]   What is it in your life that are some bad habits
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.220]   that you're locked into that you need to be set free from?
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.260]   So the reality is, I don't want to bait and switch you,
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.220]   but actually the topic that I'm going to cover tonight
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.220]   is why do I keep getting stuck in bad dating habits?
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.340]   How do I break free of the dating habits
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.200]   that are keeping me down?
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.500]   And that's what we're going to look at tonight.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.880]   See, this is not a message,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.460]   I just want to, right at the beginning,
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.220]   this is not a message for those of you
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.260]   who are in an extended season of singleness,
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.140]   you're trying to faithfully follow after God,
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.420]   this is not for you.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.580]   This is not for those of you
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.460]   who had horrible things happen against you
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.500]   in the relationship, we've talked about those.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.120]   This is for those who you are stuck in a cycle
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.940]   of constantly having the same thing happen,
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.020]   and it's time to turn the mirror on yourself
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.100]   and go, what am I doing that's causing this chronic pain
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.580]   to creep up in my own life?
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.660]   And some of you, I believe, you're here tonight.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.800]   Some of you have been excited,
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.180]   it's dating series, some of you are like,
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.020]   why am I here?
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.980]   I had to park a mile away,
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.700]   I'm sitting next to somebody who stinks,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.620]   like what is going on?
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.500]   Why am I here?
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   I believe for some of you, you're here
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.900]   because God wants to speak to you tonight.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.780]   And he needs to share some things to you
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.300]   out of his word that might hurt, but it's good.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.260]   Let me pray, and then we're going to dig into this passage.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.100]   Let's pray.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.620]   Father, we come to you tonight,
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.820]   and there's an excitement, there's an energy,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.280]   there's a passion, even as we worship,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.520]   I'm just going, God, we want you, we want you.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.680]   And yet the reality of our Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.120]   normal life is that we are stuck in a cycle
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.800]   in our dating and relationships that God, by your spirit,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.040]   I'm just asking you would break us out of tonight.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.720]   So come Holy Spirit, do whatever you need to do
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.000]   to speak to us.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.080]   We are listening to you, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.060]   All right, Luke chapter 22, we're looking at Peter's life
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.980]   as a case study of your dating life.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.080]   And you go, what?
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.900]   Just follow me.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.820]   Peter, if you're familiar with Peter,
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.620]   Peter, one of the disciples, who's just awesome.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.140]   You got to love Peter,
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.520]   because Peter was a ready, fire, aim kind of person, right?
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.420]   Some of you are like this.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.740]   You have the best intentions,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.300]   but you're just all over the place.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.900]   And this was Peter.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.780]   And Peter is a fisherman at the beginning of his life.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.100]   And Jesus comes to him, he goes, hey, you,
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.340]   come and I'll make you fishers of men.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.380]   And Peter goes right on.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.680]   He ditches the boat, he gets rid of the business,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.900]   and he follows Jesus.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.260]   You go, all right.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.780]   And Peter, throughout his life,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.100]   is constantly acting before he's thinking.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.300]   And he's constantly overreacting
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.320]   to things that are happening in his life.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.520]   And we see this on display in Luke chapter 22.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   In Luke 22, this is Jesus' last day before he dies,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.620]   before he's arrested, before he dies on the cross.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.180]   And Jesus has gathered up his disciples,
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.540]   and he tells them, he says, guys,
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.180]   I'm about to go to the cross, and I'm about to die.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.460]   And Peter pipes up and he goes, oh, you might,
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.780]   but if you're dying, I'm dying with you.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.460]   And Jesus says to Peter, just imagine this.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.460]   He's like, yeah, you're my boy, I'm with you.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.600]   And Jesus says, yeah, by the time the alarm,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.080]   your alarm goes off tomorrow,
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.360]   by the time the rooster crows tomorrow,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.640]   you'll have denied me three times.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.280]   And Peter goes, no, no, no, there's no way.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.760]   And then we get to the text we're looking at today.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.160]   Look at Luke 22, go down to verse 54.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.800]   Here, Jesus has just been arrested,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.600]   and we're gonna see three things
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.160]   that happen in this passage that if you stick with me,
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.240]   will diagnose the issues and the problems
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.380]   that often show up in your dating life.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.580]   Look at verse 54, start in verse 54.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.740]   It says, "Then they seized him," this is Jesus,
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.100]   "and led him away, bringing him into the high priest house.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.940]   "And Peter was following at a distance."
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.780]   Well, stop there.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.740]   The first thing that we see of what Peter's doing,
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.340]   the first thing is his position.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.100]   Peter followed Jesus, did you catch it, at a distance.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.760]   Now, this is odd for Peter,
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.920]   because Peter was a disciple of a rabbi,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.420]   and they used to say of disciples,
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.240]   they were covered by the dust of their rabbi.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.000]   Peter in particular was always right by Jesus,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.040]   just annoyingly so.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.620]   I mean, he's that kid, just always there, just always there.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.440]   And yet now in this particular situation,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.040]   he's following him at a distance.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.520]   See, at this particular moment in Peter's life,
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.640]   following Jesus came with a cost, and he knew it.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.300]   See, he knew the closer in proximity,
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.300]   in position that I get to Jesus,
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.160]   it may cost me if people associate me with him.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.800]   So I'm just gonna put him at an arm's length.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.640]   Let's keep reading, look at verse 55.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.700]   It says, "And when they had kindled a fire,"
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.660]   if you write in your Bible, circle fire, so important.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.340]   We're gonna come back to that.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.980]   "And when they had kindled a fire
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.100]   "in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together,
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.600]   "Peter sat down among them."
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.100]   The second thing we see is that Peter
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.060]   not only had a position away from Jesus,
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.780]   he had pressure on him to fit in.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.400]   Peter wanted to fit in.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.040]   It's very interesting, at the end it says,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.100]   "Peter sat down among them."
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.020]   The last thing that Jesus had said to his disciples
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.320]   had prayed for them in the garden as he said,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.420]   "God, I'm praying that they would be, yes, in the world,
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.740]   "but not of the world."
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.380]   And Peter's doing the opposite here.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.700]   He's associating, going, "I just wanna fit in.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.660]   "I don't wanna be different, I just wanna fit in."
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.980]   And let's keep reading, verse 56.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.400]   "Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.980]   "looking closely at him, said,
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.380]   "This man was also with him," was also with Jesus.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.080]   "But he denied it, saying, 'Woman, I do not know him.'
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.220]   "And a little later, someone else saw him and said,
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.700]   "'You are one of them.'
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.080]   "But Peter says, 'Man, I am not.'
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.300]   "And after an interval of about an hour,
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.960]   "still another insisted, saying,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.960]   "Certainly this man was also with him,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.920]   "for he too is a Galilean."
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.080]   Verse 60.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.100]   "But Peter said, 'Man, I do not know
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.220]   "what you are talking about.'"
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.500]   The last part here is Peter's posture,
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.300]   and we see that he lies and he hides.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.500]   In this particular situation, when people,
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.840]   regardless of their motive, start questioning,
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.620]   "Hey, what are you doing here?"
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.900]   Rather than being up front, Peter hides and Peter lies.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.620]   And in Matthew's account, it says on that last lie,
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.540]   he invokes a curse on himself.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.540]   Okay, so we're gonna stop.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.900]   We're gonna read the rest,
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.580]   but let's just use this as a diagnosis
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.660]   of your own dating life.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.400]   You'll see where we're going.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.940]   Many of you, your dating life
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.980]   follows a similar pattern to this.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.980]   So let's start with position.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.820]   Do you follow Jesus, but only at a distance,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.500]   like Peter here?
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.780]   Do you follow Jesus, but only with a distance?
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.260]   Rather than being covered with the dust of your rabbi,
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.820]   do you hold Jesus at an arm's length?
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.260]   Some of you are so down to be associated with Jesus,
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.120]   as long as it works to your advantage.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.740]   So on your Instagram bio, you got that verse in there.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.060]   You know, you can't quote it.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.060]   You don't know what it says, but it's in there
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.420]   because it gets me the kind of rapport,
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.540]   the kind of people I wanna be associated with.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.140]   Man, some of you, it's that,
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.220]   man, I'm down to go to church or the porch
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.500]   if it's convenient, if it works out.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.500]   Others of you is, man, I'll pray
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.640]   before that big presentation, but push come to shove.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.660]   When your reputation is on the line,
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.260]   then Jesus is just at an arm's length.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.740]   If you're in a relationship
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.100]   and you're wanting it to be associated with Jesus,
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.300]   but then the other person says,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.380]   ah, if you're into all that, I'm gonna break up with you.
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.460]   You go, ah, that's not worth it.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.140]   Some of you, you would say, man,
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.700]   if Jesus were to change how I live my weekends
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.320]   or my mornings or my evenings, then no, it's not worth it.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.820]   Or if being associated with Jesus
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.300]   would make me odd or weird, arm's length, arm's length.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.940]   And oftentimes in dating relationships,
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.140]   we find this the most.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.980]   I remember when I went on my first date with Jen, my wife,
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.780]   I had the whole thing planned out.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.340]   I took her to dinner in Lower Greenville.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.620]   It was amazing.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.540]   Then we went down to coffee and we're in the coffee shop
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.140]   and we're talking to the barista
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.900]   and the barista is honest.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.780]   And she just said, hey, I'm struggling.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.740]   I said, how are you doing?
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.420]   She's like, to be honest, I'm just struggling.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.180]   Like, it's been kind of a hard day.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.700]   And I felt in my head, been following Jesus for a while.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   I felt in my head, pray for her, like out loud right now.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.780]   I'm like, oh man, it's a busy coffee shop.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.620]   Like I'm on this date with Jen who I don't really know.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.620]   Like I know she's a Christian, but this is weird.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.160]   Can I pray for you right now?
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.780]   Pause, church in the coffee shop.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.400]   You know, but I remember thinking, all right,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.240]   I'm gonna do it.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.500]   And I just tell this barista, hey,
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.900]   is it cool if we pray real quick right now, 30 seconds?
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.220]   And she's like, yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.980]   And I pray for her and then we go sit down
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.980]   and to be totally honest, I forgot about it.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.700]   And months later, as Jen and I are talking
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.460]   and we're considering getting engaged,
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.620]   she said, you know, Tyler, that moment right there
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.840]   was the turning point for me in how I thought about you.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.820]   Because it didn't feel like a show
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.940]   and it didn't feel like you were trying
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.180]   to do something to get me.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.100]   It felt like it was just real and it was you.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.460]   And I've never seen somebody do that before.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.380]   And it made me wanna be with you.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.060]   And it was interesting for me, that was such a wrestle.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.740]   And then I forgot about it, but for Jen,
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.260]   it was something that set me apart.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.940]   I'm curious for you, in that kind of situation,
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.940]   would you lean in or would you push away?
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.100]   The first thing is position.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.340]   The second is pressure.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.460]   Do you purely wanna fit in?
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.540]   When it comes to dating relationships,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.620]   do you purely wanna fit in?
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.180]   Are your dating convictions set primarily
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.220]   by the environment that you're in?
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.340]   Does every person you date, you change like a chameleon
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.940]   a little bit who you are to try to woo this person,
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.900]   to try to fit in with their friend group,
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.540]   and you're constantly changing?
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.620]   Some of you, every time you date someone different,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.300]   everything about your wardrobe, your sports teams,
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.420]   your desires, your affections, your food choices,
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.420]   your dietary restrictions change because of this person.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.740]   And you go, man, you're a shape shifter.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.420]   You're just constantly changing to kind of get this person.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.260]   And some of you, it's beyond just that.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.560]   It goes into your convictions.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   Where you walk in with a pure set of convictions
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.960]   and then that person doesn't align.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.780]   You go, ah, okay, not a big deal.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.820]   I'll go with what you have.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.780]   I remember when I was a youth pastor,
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.480]   which is wild 'cause some of my youth ministry kids
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.440]   are now young adults.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.500]   Many of you are here, which is like insane.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.300]   But I remember when they were freshmen in high school.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.140]   And you got some of these freshmen boys
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.620]   who they don't even know what cologne is.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.820]   Like they've never even, they don't know what it is.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.780]   Showers are optional.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.460]   Clothing is like I can wear the same exact thing
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.480]   seven days in a row.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.080]   And all of a sudden everything starts to shift.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.380]   They're smelling good.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.540]   They're changing their clothes.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.380]   In fact, you can smell them walk into the building
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.180]   'cause the Axe Aroma, a body spray,
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.180]   is just following them.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.820]   And you know that dude's got a girl.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.140]   And he's starting to change who he is.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.000]   And there's elements of that that are funny.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.780]   There's elements of that that are good.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.780]   But some of you, some of you so much of your convictions,
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.740]   of your beliefs, of the things that you would die for,
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.980]   of the things that you would worship Jesus with
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.840]   can change like that with that person.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:24.260]   And you're very much like Peter here where you'll change.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.340]   And I just wanna say, if that's you, I would be concerned.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.260]   I would be concerned.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.620]   Right now, all you can see is the positive of that person.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.980]   But if you will give up your convictions that quickly,
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.820]   what else will you be willing to give up?
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.340]   And I would just caution you, make sure your eyes are open
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.580]   and you are not being manipulated.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.740]   And you will look back months and years later
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.920]   and go, what was I thinking?
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.500]   And that goes into the third one, the posture.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:00.280]   Is your relationship built on lies and on hiding?
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.520]   See, are there people in your life
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.500]   who you know love you that you're not listening to
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.380]   and you're not being upfront with?
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.820]   Because in reality,
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.340]   you don't wanna know what they have to say.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.580]   Some of you, there are people in your life
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.580]   who are looking at your relationship
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.340]   and they're trying to give you advice,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.300]   but all you wanna hear is, we're for you, we're for you.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.140]   You don't wanna know the truth.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.900]   And so you begin to push them away.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.540]   And I would be careful.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.340]   If this is what you're doing in your relationship,
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.760]   you're digging yourself into a hole
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.580]   and you're not heeding the wisdom
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.620]   that Proverbs 11, 14 says,
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.460]   where there is no wisdom, a people falls,
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.120]   but in an abundance of counselors, there is safety.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.900]   Rather than heeding that proverb,
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.540]   you're becoming a proverb.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.020]   Proverb 18, verse one says,
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.260]   "Whoever isolates himself, seeks his own desire,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.660]   he breaks out against all sound judgment."
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.400]   If you're constantly sneaking around,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.320]   if you're constantly keeping secrets
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.780]   from those who love you the most,
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.600]   living in the dark, you are not really living.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.260]   If your mantra in your relationship is,
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.460]   man, it's us against the world,
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.420]   you're not living a fairy tale,
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.060]   you're living a nightmare.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.100]   That's where you're living.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.920]   I remember as I look back on my dating relationships,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.840]   there were a number of relationships in my life
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.980]   where as I look back,
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.860]   my family and those around were not for it.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.100]   And it wasn't so much because of the other person.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.940]   It was really, they were looking at us together
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.380]   and they're going, "God, Tyler, it just doesn't make sense."
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.180]   And it's funny, you know, as they would do that,
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.300]   every time I'd have that conversation,
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.420]   I'd be so excited, like, "Hey, what do you think?"
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.100]   And they'd be like, "Man, I'm not sure."
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.300]   I would get so offended.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.660]   I'd get so offended, like, "How dare you?
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.740]   How dare you think I, this is what my heart wants
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.180]   and you're against me?"
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.380]   And I'd start hearing those lies in my head, like,
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.820]   "Well, if they're not for me in this,
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.180]   then are they for me in anything?"
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.740]   And I'd start pushing them away.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.540]   And I'd start looking for people
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.300]   who would affirm my relationship.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.580]   And so all of a sudden I got new friend groups started
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.940]   with new community who are for me
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.500]   because I'm pushing away the people who are going,
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.980]   "Tyler, I'm just trying to tell you good advice.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.020]   And I can tell you in hindsight,
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.780]   100% of the time, that was a mistake, 100%."
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.260]   Instead, the way, what Kylan's talked about
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.860]   is to win somebody who you know loves you,
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.020]   goes, "Hey, I'm concerned."
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.340]   Coming to them and not being defensive,
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.500]   but being curious and saying, "Can you tell me?
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.820]   Can you tell me more?
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.340]   What is it that you're concerned about?
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.740]   What is it that doesn't make sense to you?"
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.300]   And leaning into that.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.060]   See, everything was different when I dated my wife, Jen.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.060]   See, right from the beginning, Jen and I,
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.220]   we wanted our relationship to be in public.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.020]   We wanted our families in at the very beginning
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.020]   and we didn't want them to give us fluff.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.660]   We wanted them to give us the truth.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.460]   Our families didn't live nearby.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.460]   We were in Dallas.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.700]   They lived in Oklahoma and in Tennessee.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.860]   But within the first three months, we had visited both.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.100]   'Cause we're like, "We just want you to see.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.700]   We want you to be all aware."
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.700]   And I remember taking the drive to Tennessee
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.220]   and hanging with my parents
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.780]   and they're giving me like behind her back.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.940]   They're like, "She's great."
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.500]   You know, and I'm like, "Cool."
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.060]   And we go out to dinner.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.340]   I didn't know if I was gonna share this,
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.460]   but it was just so funny.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.380]   We go to dinner and we're three months
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.460]   into this relationship and I'm just,
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.900]   they're just getting to know her.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.340]   And my dad goes, "So what's your timeline on marriage?"
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.260]   You know, I was like, "Dad, it's been three months.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.620]   Like we haven't talked about this."
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.660]   And Jen's like, "What?"
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.740]   You know, but my family was just going,
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.380]   "Hey, we've seen it and we're in."
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.100]   And I'm just telling you, there's something so life-giving
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.740]   to being like, "Oh, community knows us.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.460]   They're aware, they're speaking into our life
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.660]   and they're for us."
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:08.180]   Not just in our family, but in the way
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.620]   that we spent time together.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.500]   Jen and I just decided right from the beginning.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.900]   She was a teacher, I was a youth pastor.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.500]   We were like, "We don't wanna live in such a way
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.980]   where as we date, if we spend time together,
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.380]   you know, one night and then we see one of our students
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.900]   the next day and they go, 'Hey, I saw you last night,'
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.700]   that we'd have that sinking feeling of like,
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.740]   "Oh no, what did you see?"
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.340]   So we just decided, this is radical to some of you.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.060]   We decided in our dating relationship,
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.900]   we will never be alone.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.940]   We will never be alone.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.360]   And even when we said it, we're like,
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.940]   "I don't know how this is gonna work.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.220]   'Cause like, what if we're hanging
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.580]   and then your roommates leave?"
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.660]   But we're like, "We're just never gonna be alone."
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.260]   And you know what it did?
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.460]   As we took all of that potential hiding,
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.140]   potential like alone time, and we just were in public a lot.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.540]   We were intentional dates.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.540]   It forced us to be creative rather than just to go,
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.740]   "Hey, you wanna go watch a show?
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.500]   You wanna go to your apartment?"
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.780]   And we just hang and then find ourselves in a situation
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.620]   where Netflix and chill just happens.
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.900]   And we just said, "That's off the table.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.140]   It's not happening."
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.420]   And I can just tell you here on this stage,
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.280]   no regrets, zero regrets.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.720]   Because Jen and I just said,
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.440]   "We're not living with lies
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.240]   and we're not living in hiding.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.080]   We're gonna be radical."
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.200]   And yet in doing that, we believe God's way is better.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.080]   We believe it's better.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.960]   Proverbs 14, verse 12 says that,
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.200]   "There is a way that seems right to a man,
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.240]   but in the end is the way of death."
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.840]   I'm just curious for you,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.600]   as you diagnose your dating relationships,
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.400]   do you go, "Man, there's a way that feels right.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.080]   There's a relationship I'm trying to make happen.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.120]   My community isn't for it.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.080]   We're doing some things that I've got some bad feelings
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.360]   about, but I enjoy this person.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.880]   I enjoy being with them."
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.120]   And yet God goes, "There's a way that seems right,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.040]   but the end is the way of death."
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.800]   So diagnose, how is your position?
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.320]   What is the pressure that's on you?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.800]   And what is your posture right now?
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.920]   And we just wanna keep,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.040]   let's keep looking at the story with Peter
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.820]   of what happens next.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.080]   So Peter is in the midst of this moment
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.480]   where his position, his posture, all of these things,
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.080]   the pressure is on him.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.920]   And then let's pick it up in the second half of verse 60.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:39.240]   It says, "And immediately, while he was still speaking,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.460]   the rooster crowed.
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.200]   And the Lord," this is Jesus,
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.240]   "turns and looked at Peter.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.960]   And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord,
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.840]   how he had said to him, 'Before the rooster crows today,
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.880]   you will deny me three times.'
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.720]   And he went out and wept bitterly."
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.360]   The rooster, the very thing Jesus said would happen,
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360]   happened here.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.200]   And I've been thinking,
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.380]   what was so big about the rooster crowing?
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.400]   Some of you, you've been in church, you know this story.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.960]   What was so big with Peter,
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.200]   with that rooster crowing that made him go,
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.760]   "Okay, I think I'm good, I'm good, I'm good,"
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.720]   to all of a sudden he's weeping bitterly.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.220]   And it's because when that rooster crowed,
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.360]   the eyes of his heart were open
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.860]   and he realized what he had been doing.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.460]   And I've just been praying leading up to tonight
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.380]   that for some of you, the rooster would crow tonight.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.420]   For some of you in the midst of the sexual sin
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.840]   that you're living in, the relationship that is not healthy,
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.320]   the way that you treat people that leads them on,
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.080]   the way you're pushing out community,
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.000]   that all that tonight, the rooster would crow.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.160]   And some of you, it's not just tonight,
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.520]   it's the season that you've been in
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.160]   where the rooster has been crowing,
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.860]   where the eyes have been open and you've wept those tears.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.480]   We sing the songs, we have the energy, the excitement,
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.520]   and yet relationships, I remember talking to people
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.720]   as a youth pastor in college ministry
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.040]   and nothing causes more pain
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.800]   than a relationship gone wrong.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.320]   And some of you have been there.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.200]   And so I wanna spend the end of our time
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.400]   looking at two things that happens
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.140]   from this moment on in Peter's life.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:34.440]   This could have been the end of Peter's story, and it's not.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.940]   It is not the end.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.520]   There's two things that happen that Jesus does
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.880]   that makes the reputation of Peter completely different.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.800]   If you have your Bible,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.980]   just flip a little bit over to John chapter 21.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.300]   John chapter 21.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.200]   The first thing that happens in Peter's life,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.280]   remember the last scene that we've seen of Peter
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.680]   is the rooster crowed, Jesus looks at him,
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.240]   he's filled with what feels like condemnation,
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.300]   he hits the ground, he's weeping, I'm undone.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.860]   And the next thing that we see is John chapter 21.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:13.120]   Now in John chapter 21, Jesus has already died,
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.240]   he rises again, and notice what Peter's doing.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.180]   Look at John chapter 21, verse three.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.320]   It says, "Then Simon Peter said to them,"
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.440]   he's talking to the other disciples,
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.980]   and he says, "I am going fishing."
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.200]   And he said, "Then they said to him, 'We will go with you.'
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.760]   And they went out and they got into the boat,
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.320]   and that night they caught nothing."
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.040]   This is interesting, Peter, after this moment,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.560]   he thinks to himself and he goes,
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.160]   "Man, I'm just gonna go back to doing the thing
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.720]   that I know I'm good at.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.720]   I tried the whole apostle gig, that didn't work out,
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.840]   and so I'm going back to fishing."
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.000]   I was thinking, this is some of you
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.160]   where you tried doing dating God's way,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.380]   you tried doing it right, and yet that failed miserably,
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.020]   you get broken up with, your heart is in pieces,
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.740]   and you go, "You know what, I'm just not good enough,
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.860]   I'm just gonna go back to what I know,
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.720]   because that's all that I'm good for,
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.880]   that's all that I got."
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.120]   From there, they still, they catch nothing,
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.920]   he goes back to what he's good at, he still catches nothing.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.360]   Then look down in verse seven,
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.200]   then it says, "The disciple who Jesus loved," that's John,
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.540]   "Therefore said to Peter, 'It's the Lord.'"
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.000]   So Jesus, as they're out there, they're catching nothing,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.680]   Jesus comes up, tells them to throw the net
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.860]   on the other side, and John sees it, he says,
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.320]   "It is the Lord."
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.400]   When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.840]   he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work,
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.020]   and he threw himself into the sea.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.720]   I just love this, Peter's out there,
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.640]   he's hanging with the boys, he's got his shirt off,
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.720]   son's out, guns out, he's just out there,
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.660]   just living life, right?
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.200]   And he realizes it's Jesus,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.660]   and then he puts on his clothes and jumps into the water,
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.040]   I don't know who does that, that's our boy Peter,
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.600]   he jumps into the water, and he swims,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.120]   and he goes onto the beach, and we see Jesus is there,
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.960]   look down in verse nine.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.920]   "And when they got out on land,
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.100]   they saw a charcoal fire in place,
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.680]   with fish laid out on it, and bread.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.760]   And Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.160]   that you have just caught.'"
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.680]   Peter hears Jesus is on the shore,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.480]   he swims over there, he gets up,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.400]   and he sees a haunting image.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.120]   So remember I told you earlier to circle where it said fire,
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.440]   in John's account of this story,
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.400]   the fire that Peter was sitting around
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.560]   when he had denied Jesus was a charcoal fire,
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.800]   that's what it says in John chapter 18, very specific.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.680]   And a charcoal fire was not just some normal fire,
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.080]   back in their day it was very expensive,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   and it was very rare to have a charcoal fire.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.400]   And yet Jesus very intentionally,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.760]   there on the beach has a charcoal fire going,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.960]   and you know Peter, he's just gone through this,
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.300]   he sees that fire and he goes, "Oh man,
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.880]   here comes the I told you so speech."
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.920]   I mean, he's got the prop, he's got the moment,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.200]   you've been fishing, give me some of your fish,
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.580]   look at this fire, and I told you,
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.240]   I told you that toxic relationship
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.720]   was gonna lead to your downfall, I told you.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.760]   I told you if you took the filters off your phone,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.240]   you were gonna end up right in the same place, I told you.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.760]   I told you that if you went away from the advice
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.220]   of your family and your community, this was gonna happen.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.240]   I told you, and what does Jesus do?
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.720]   This is wild, what does Jesus do?
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.780]   Look at verse 15.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.240]   When they had finished breakfast,
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.920]   Jesus said to Simon Peter, he takes him aside,
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.400]   "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.000]   He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.960]   He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.000]   He said to him a second time,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.080]   "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.380]   He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.440]   He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   He said to him a third time,
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.520]   "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.200]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.240]   "Do you love me?"
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.440]   And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything,
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.280]   "and you know that I love you."
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.840]   And Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.200]   What is Jesus doing here?
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.120]   Notice he's reversing the denial.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.660]   The three things that Peter had done
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.120]   in the midst of that denying Jesus in front of people,
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.640]   Jesus reverses it here in this moment.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.680]   His position, he singles Peter out.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.600]   He says, "No more following at a distance.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.640]   "I want you close."
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.300]   He, the pressure, he appoints Peter as a leader.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.340]   He says, "I don't want you just among people.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.320]   "I want you a leader of them."
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.640]   And then the posture, he reverses his lies.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.320]   Three times he asks him, "Do you love me?
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.220]   "Do you love me?
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.120]   "Do you love me?"
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.960]   And Jesus reestablishes relationship with Peter,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.240]   and he reminds him of his calling.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.400]   Just thinking of some of you in this room,
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.480]   how many of you has your past dating relationship
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.520]   in one way or another, something that happened,
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.220]   something that you did, something that you are a part of,
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.360]   the toxicity that you got led into
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.400]   has led you to the spot where you're broken,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.920]   and you're there like Peter was.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.080]   And your Savior tonight,
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.240]   tonight the reason why you're here
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.280]   is Jesus is looking at you, forget all of us,
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.680]   he's looking at you with the charcoal fire,
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.640]   with the very thing that brings so much shame in your life,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.260]   and he's saying, "I want you to look at this.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.840]   "Why does this keep happening to me?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.080]   "Why is this going on?"
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.320]   He goes, "I want you to look at it right in the face."
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.080]   He says, "The very thing that brought so much shame
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.200]   "in your life, I want you to know
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.600]   "that I've come to redeem that thing
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.080]   "and bring relationship back with you.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.680]   "I'm not here to condemn you,
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.200]   "I'm here to restore relationship with you."
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.360]   Even looking at the line of Jesus,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.680]   God doesn't, he's not scared of the messed up people.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.320]   He's not afraid of the ones who are going,
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.720]   "Oh man, I've gone too far."
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.680]   He goes, "Man, think of the line of Jesus.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.960]   "You got Rahab, who's a prostitute.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.660]   "You got David, who's a murderer and adulterer
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.880]   "in the line of Jesus.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.720]   "It doesn't matter how far you've gone."
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.880]   Jesus says, "I wanna use you."
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.000]   God's not scared of your broken past.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.480]   He wants to redeem you and set you on the path of life
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.020]   such that you start tending what you used to be taking.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.200]   I remember someone once telling me,
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   they said, "Every guy, every guy in the world
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.580]   "is one of two things.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.040]   "They're either a predator or they're a protector."
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.160]   And some of you guys have been living
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.460]   as predators, you've been just trying to take, take, take.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.520]   And tonight is the opportunity, the moment to go,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.240]   "No, I don't wanna take.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.660]   "I wanna start tending.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.560]   "I wanna start giving.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.860]   "I wanna start protecting.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.080]   "I wanna see the image bearers around me,
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.580]   "not as people to take from, but as people to protect."
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.400]   Some of you ladies, you live constantly going,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.020]   "Man, if I can just get that relationship,
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.100]   "then I'll have a rock and all the hard things in my life,
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.800]   "it's me and him, and then I could just be together."
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.860]   And I would say, read the Psalms,
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.100]   where David is constantly going,
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.420]   "God, lead me to the rock that's higher than mine,
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.540]   "that's higher than me.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.140]   "I need something that's deeper, that's greater than you."
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.320]   The first thing Jesus restores, relationship with Peter.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.040]   The second thing, the last thing, we're gonna end with this,
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.800]   is Jesus empowers Peter with the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   Not only is Peter forgiven and restored with Jesus,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.580]   he's empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.620]   And in the book of Acts,
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:57.220]   we see that Peter becomes a leader in the church.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.860]   And Acts chapter four says that the Holy Spirit
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.780]   actually fills him such that he begins to speak
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.060]   in front of people and a very mouth,
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.060]   his very mouth that caused him so much downfall
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.800]   becomes the instrument God uses to spark
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.840]   the early church, the movement of the early church
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.660]   throughout the world.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.340]   And not only that, but in Acts chapter four,
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.000]   the Jewish leaders come and they threaten Peter.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.740]   And they say, "Hey, you're not allowed to talk anymore
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.500]   "in the name of Jesus."
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.220]   And I love it, one of my favorite verses in the whole Bible,
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.380]   Acts chapter four, verse 19 and 20, Peter says to them,
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.160]   he says, "Whether it is right in the sight of God
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.580]   "to listen to you rather than God, you must judge,
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.600]   "for we cannot but speak of what we've seen
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.860]   "and what we've heard."
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.880]   Not only has Peter been forgiven,
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.760]   but he's been empowered by the Holy Spirit
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.480]   to do what he could have never imagined.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.420]   And Peter became a person that now we look at
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.040]   as a person of conviction and of wisdom
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.400]   and of boldness and of courage.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.740]   And I just believe for some of you, don't buy the lie
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.460]   that you're too broken, that you've gone too far,
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.100]   that you're too messed up, that you're too anything.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.060]   God looks at you like he looks at Peter and he says,
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.900]   "I understand, I know what I purchased.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.640]   "And I'm looking at you saying,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.940]   "if you will come into relationship with me
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.100]   "and be empowered by my spirit,
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.340]   "then don't put limits on what I'm able to do."
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.580]   I wanna end with two questions.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.200]   Two questions that we're just gonna take a minute
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.040]   before we go back into worship to just think about.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.960]   Number one is this, is Jesus wanting to meet with you
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.140]   around a charcoal fire tonight?
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:55.440]   Not to condemn you, but to restore his relationship with you.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:01.180]   To stare at that thing that has so often stolen from you
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.420]   and to say, "No, no, no, I wanna redeem you
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.560]   "in the midst of that."
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.300]   And then number two, the second question is this,
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.820]   is do you have the Holy Spirit?
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.740]   Do you have the Holy Spirit?
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.420]   Some of you have been trying and failing
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.060]   and trying and failing and trying and failing.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.720]   You're going, "Man, is there any hope?"
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.220]   And I would just say, don't assume that the answer
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.940]   to do you have the Holy Spirit is yes.
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.320]   And instead, maybe tonight it's the opportunity to go,
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.560]   "God, I want, I need a power inside of myself
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.540]   "to do beyond what I can do."
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.860]   I believe God is inviting some of you
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.620]   for this to be a moment of surrender to say,
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.020]   "God, I need the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.580]   "I need a spirit inside that leads me on a direction,
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.820]   "on a path that's different than what I've been living
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.920]   "up to this point."
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.660]   That maybe the way to live and to date
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.520]   is not by just trying harder,
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.900]   but it's by surrendering to His Spirit.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.740]   Let's pray together.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:12.340]   Father, we just confess that we need you.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:18.980]   And Lord, I just pray for some who've come into this place
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.060]   going, "Man, if I can just overlook all that,
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.020]   "I'm gonna carry that thing to the grave.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.340]   "I don't want to have to deal with the messiness
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.200]   "and the shame and the guilt in my life."
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.160]   And if I know anything about you, God,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.020]   it's that you force us in your grace to stare right at it,
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.040]   to look at that thing that's brought so much shame
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.740]   and guilt and say, "No, no, no.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.820]   "What the enemy meant for evil,
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.740]   "I am going to use for good."
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:53.600]   And God, like you took, even with Peter,
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   so much of a sporadic story of his life and used it.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.660]   You course corrected him and you set him on a trajectory
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.300]   to be used by you for things he could have never dreamed.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.620]   God, I believe tonight you want some of that for us.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.380]   And so God, would you restore to us
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.120]   the joy of your salvation?
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.940]   God, would there truly be,
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.780]   in the midst of our broken relationships,
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.280]   a restoration of our relationship with you?
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.780]   And be set free to be filled with your spirit
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.100]   to do what you've called us to do.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.180]   God, we love you and we trust you.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.940]   In Jesus' name, amen.
