00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 >> Let's sing it together. We're going to sing it together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 >> Let's sing it together.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 >> Where can I go from your spirit?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Where can I hide from your face?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Where can I flee from your presence?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Where would I go? Where would I go?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 If I rise to the heavens, you're with me.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 If I fall to the depths of the sea,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 even there it's your hand that will lead me

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 wherever I go, wherever I go.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Wherever I go, you go with me, you go with me.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Father, and Lord you search me.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 How you know me.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 You perceive my every thought from afar.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 In all my wandering, still you love me.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 King of glory, you pursue my anxious heart.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Even when I'm not your faithful,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 even when I doubt your truth holds,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 even when I'm lost, you won't let me go.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And when my heart is dry, your grace flows.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 No matter where I run, I'm not far from home.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Yeah, I may be weak, but you're able.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Even when I'm not your faithful,

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 your faithful.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Even when I'm not your faithful,

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 like a good, good father,

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 yeah, you're faithful.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And every season, even when I'm not your faithful.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And where can I go from your spirit?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Where can I hide from your face?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Where can I flee from your presence?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Where would I go, where would I go?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 If I rise to the heavens, you're with me.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 If I fall to the depths of the sea,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 even there it's your hand that will lead me.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Wherever I go, wherever I go.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Sing that again.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And see, where can I go from your spirit?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And where can I hide from your face?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And where can I flee from your presence?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Where would I go, where would I go?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 If I rise to the heavens, you're with me.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 If I fall to the depths of the sea,

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 even there it's your hand that will lead me.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Wherever I go, wherever I go.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Even when I'm not your faithful,

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 even when I doubt your truth.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Even when I'm lost, you won't let me go.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Oh, Father, no, you won't let me go.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 When my heart is dry, your grace flows.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 No matter where I run, I'm not far from home.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Yeah, I may be weak, but you're able.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Even when I'm not your faithful,

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 your love's gonna find me in every season.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 When I'm not your faithful,

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 your grace's gonna find me in every season.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Oh, you're faithful.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 This I know, this I need.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 When I'm not your faithful.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Oh, you're faithful.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 For you knew my history,

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and yet still you adopted me.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 With all of my baggage,

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 still you claim me as your own.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Now I'm home in the love of the Father.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I belong in the heart of the Father.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I belong in the love of the Father.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And I'm coming back, coming back, oh.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I'm coming back to where I belong.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Will you got there to you?

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Ooh, I'm coming back to you.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I'm coming back to you.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I'm coming back to you.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 You're my first love.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 That is who you are.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 God, you're my first love.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 That is who you are.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I've tasted and I've seen,

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 and nothing else can satisfy my heart.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 No, nothing else can satisfy my heart.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 So I'm coming home, I'm coming home.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So now I'm coming, I'm coming back to you.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Hear your children.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I'm coming back to you.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 You receive me as I am.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I'm coming back to you.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Broken as I am.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I'm coming back to you.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I'm coming, I'm coming back.

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I'm coming back to you.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Here I am, father.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Will you receive me in all of whose I am?

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 I'm coming back to you.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm running.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000

 Ooh, 'cause I have decided to follow Jesus.

 Ooh, 'cause I have decided to follow Jesus.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And I have decided to follow Jesus.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And I have decided to follow Jesus.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I have decided to follow Jesus.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 No turning back, no turning back.

 I'm never looking back.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I'm coming, one more time, to you.
