1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 [dramatic music]

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:26,660
 >> All right, let's go.

3
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,060
 Welcome everybody in the room.

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,960
 Tuning in at all of our locations,

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,660
 everybody that's here.

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,180
 And I want to welcome a handful

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,940
 or a few of our Porch Live locations

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,100
 out of the 12, Porch North Houston,

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,860
 Porch Houston, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Austin, Texas,

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,700
 and all the locations and everybody online.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,380
 We are wrapping up this series on scandals.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,860
 We have been looking at sinners that led to the Savior,

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,900
 the men and women who made up the family tree of Jesus.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,460
 And tonight we're going to look at the setup

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,900
 upon which the Savior arrived into the world.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,980
 And Matthew's account,

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,940
 which really comes right after he walks through,

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,620
 hey, this is the family of Jesus

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,300
 and this is the birth of Jesus.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,340
 And so in order to do that,

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,660
 let me start with a story that'll give us

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,900
 a little bit of tracks for where we're going.

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,020
 In 2015, my wife and I found out

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,180
 we were pregnant with our first child,

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,960
 our son, his name is Crew.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,060
 We're stoked.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,080
 And at that time we were living in a rental property

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,500
 and we were trying to figure out,

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,360
 hey, is this going to be where we end up,

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,340
 you know, making a home

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,900
 and the baby nursery,

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,200
 or are we going to buy a house

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,260
 because we've been in the market looking for a house.

34
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,700
 And we looked and looked and hadn't been successful.

35
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,220
 My wife was six months pregnant

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,700
 and somebody lists online a foreclosure property

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,040
 that was so bad,

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,660
 no one could possibly have lived inside of it.

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,340
 I mean, we'd assumed there were dead bodies

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,240
 in the wall or something,

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,620
 but it was one of those scenarios

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,620
 like I've talked about before,

43
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,700
 where you want to look for the house

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,540
 that nobody else wants.

45
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,080
 And so I was like, babe, I got our house.

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,920
 We go and see it.

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,700
 She's like, this looks like there's dead bodies

48
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,280
 in the wall or something.

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,440
 And we ended up buying the house

50
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,820
 and beginning to renovate it.

51
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,920
 Now the problem was we started renovations

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,580
 and it needed a lot of renovations.

53
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,620
 Like it was not livable.

54
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,460
 There wasn't electricity.

55
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,820
 It was not a livable place.

56
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,180
 And we started renovating it October 1st

57
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,700
 and we had a baby coming December 19th.

58
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,120
 Now I don't know if you can do math,

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,620
 but that's not a lot of time.

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,020
 I don't know, math's not my strong suit.

61
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,860
 So maybe you're right there with me,

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,980
 but that was two months of time that we had.

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,100
 And we had to do an entire renovation.

64
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,660
 And so the contractors and they're working through it

65
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,500
 and they're working on it.

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,260
 And it gets to the point where we're like, man,

67
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,180
 I think we're going to get there.

68
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,180
 And a month goes by and they made a lot of progress,

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,020
 but there's like still no drywall on the walls

70
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,580
 and the floors weren't done.

71
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,180
 And another week goes by and another week goes by.

72
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,040
 And come to find out, we had a week left.

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,940
 It was December 8th.

74
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,600
 And we had essentially another 11 days

75
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,300
 until our son was supposed to be born on December 19th.

76
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,300
 And they were supposed to finish on December 12th.

77
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,060
 And so it was like, man, this is gonna be perfect, dude.

78
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,740
 I'm dad of the year, husband of the year.

79
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,140
 I just got you a house, mom.

80
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,580
 And my wife calls me and it's December 8th

81
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,820
 and we're setting up for the Porch Christmas Concert in 2015

82
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,080
 and she says, you need to come home right now

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,820
 because the doctor said I'm having an emergency C-section

84
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,100
 because the baby is basically his head was too enormous

85
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,340
 and he needed to get out of there.

86
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,440
 True story.

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,100
 And I go home and the next morning we go in,

88
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,740
 we have a C-section, have our son.

89
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,860
 Here's a picture of crew from that time,

90
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,440
 happy as can be.

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,600
 I know, man, smiling.

92
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,700
 He's like three hours old at this point.

93
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,840
 He's just loving life.

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
 And it was awesome.

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,460
 And we spent the next three days at the hospital

96
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,140
 'cause that's what you do after you have a baby.

97
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,620
 And if you play out the math,

98
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,260
 remember the house was supposed to be done on December 12th.

99
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,720
 And we were in the hospital on December 9th.

100
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,320
 And so our expectation of we're gonna finish it,

101
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,560
 we're gonna set up the nursery,

102
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,160
 I had like promised, we're gonna have tons of time,

103
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,060
 we'll set the nursery up, it'll all be great.

104
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,160
 None of that happened.

105
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,760
 And we leave the hospital and go to an entirely empty house

106
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,320
 with all of our furniture inside of the garage

107
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,280
 and try to set up a crib and try to set up,

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,920
 just throw a mattress on the ground.

109
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,480
 And we go in and everything that I had hoped and expected

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,760
 and wanted for kind of this setup of our child entering

111
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,740
 didn't go to plan.

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,120
 Now, what does that have to do with tonight?

113
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,100
 Well, we're gonna look at the story

114
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,240
 in the entrance of Jesus,

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,440
 and you may be somewhat familiar with it,

116
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,120
 but it is certainly without,

117
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,920
 goes without saying a scenario where the birth of a child

118
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,880
 did not go to plan.

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,160
 Certainly to the plans of the mother and father

120
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,440
 in that scenario.

121
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,260
 And I wanna walk through the scandals that made up

122
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,240
 the arrival of the savior of the world,

123
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,000
 because you may have heard the Christmas story,

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,460
 you're familiar with it.

125
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,900
 But when you look at the account that Matthew gives us,

126
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,800
 unique from the account that Luke gives us,

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
 Luke gives us the account that you probably heard

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,840
 and Charlie Brown reads every single year on TV

129
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,320
 and you know, has the nativity of there were angels

130
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,760
 in the field that day and behold, a great light came up

131
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,080
 and Mary pondered all these things in her heart.

132
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,280
 Matthew's account is full of scandal after scandal

133
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,840
 from an unplanned pregnancy

134
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,840
 to an attempted breaking off engagement to a genocide

135
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,800
 to these foreign mystics showing up, random strangers.

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,060
 And Matthew shows us the scandals that led

137
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,340
 to the savior of the world.

138
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,820
 And more importantly, in looking at these scandals,

139
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,300
 we learned something about God

140
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,460
 and how we are to come to him.

141
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,100
 And we learned something about how God has come

142
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,660
 to every person here.

143
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,940
 And finally, we see that God is at work

144
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,800
 despite what you see.

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,180
 So I wanna walk through and I'm gonna trace

146
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,100
 these three scandals and each has a truth

147
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,140
 that corresponds with it.

148
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,460
 We're gonna be in Matthew chapter one.

149
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,100
 If you have a Bible, you can flip right there.

150
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,540
 If not, it'll be up on the screens.

151
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,540
 We're gonna look at the setup

152
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,840
 that led to the savior of the world, Jesus being born.

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,340
 Matthew verse 18, this is right after we finished last week

154
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,940
 and remember in scandals, we went through Judah and Tamar

155
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,500
 and Matthew goes out of his way to be like,

156
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,100
 look at all these crazy people in Jesus's family tree

157
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,020
 like Judah and Tamar where he basically slept

158
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,660
 with his daughter-in-law and not only that,

159
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,180
 Jesus was related to Rahab.

160
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,420
 Remember Rahab, Grandma Rahab?

161
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,960
 Yeah, the prostitute and he walks through and goes through

162
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,820
 and then David and Bathsheba and adultery

163
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,160
 and he's traced all these scandals

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,100
 and then he goes into the scandals

165
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,020
 surrounding the birth of Jesus and what we learn about him.

166
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,340
 So this comes in verse 18 right after we finished

167
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,380
 the lineage and genealogy, it says this.

168
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,820
 "This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about.

169
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,740
 "His mother Mary was engaged or pledged

170
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,080
 "to be married to Joseph.

171
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,060
 "But before they came together,

172
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,060
 "she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit

173
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,960
 "because Joseph, her husband," at that time to be engaged

174
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,020
 basically meant in order to break off an engagement,

175
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,460
 you had to do something legally

176
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,140
 to break down that engagement.

177
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,460
 "He was a faithful man to the law

178
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,000
 "and he didn't want to expose her to public disgrace.

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,220
 "He had in mind that he would divorce her quietly."

180
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,820
 Now you've heard this story before

181
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,700
 and you kind of know how it ends

182
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,820
 but I want you to think about what Joseph and Mary

183
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,900
 felt in that moment.

184
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,260
 You got this happy, engaged couple,

185
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,100
 things are going great, planning the wedding,

186
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,540
 picking out invitations, she's picking out a dress,

187
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,980
 all the different things that you'd be excited

188
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,820
 about getting married in that day.

189
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,520
 And one day she realizes, "I'm pregnant."

190
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,360
 And she shows up at Joe's house and says,

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,360
 crazy story, okay, so I'm pregnant and God is the father.

192
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,460
 And to us, you're familiar with it

193
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,260
 but think about all the emotions that you,

194
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,180
 I mean, what would you think?

195
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,460
 JD's engaged right now.

196
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,100
 They're weeks away from getting married.

197
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,940
 If Jenna, his fiance, showed up and she was like,

198
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,460
 "Hey, this is gonna sound crazy but I'm having a baby."

199
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,940
 And no, it's not anybody else's baby, it's God's baby.

200
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,520
 What would you respond with?

201
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,300
 And so of course Joseph is going,

202
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,820
 "Man, this girl's not just pregnant, she's crazy.

203
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,860
 "And so I'm not gonna end up marrying crazy."

204
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,300
 Until that night, an angel shows up and says this.

205
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,660
 "After he considered this, an angel of the Lord

206
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,240
 "appeared to Joseph in a dream and said,

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,300
 "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary

208
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,640
 "home as your wife because what is conceived in her

209
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,800
 "is from the Holy Spirit.

210
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,440
 "She will give birth to a son

211
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,240
 "and you are to give him the name Jesus

212
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,240
 "because he will save his people from their sins."

213
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,380
 You're gonna have a baby

214
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,480
 that will be the savior of your people.

215
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,420
 All of this took place, Matthew says,

216
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,660
 to fulfill what the Lord had said to the prophet.

217
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,660
 "The virgin will conceive,"

218
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,180
 and he quotes an Old Testament prophet,

219
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,880
 "and give birth to a son

220
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,180
 "and they will call him Immanuel."

221
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,820
 It was to be born of a virgin.

222
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,380
 The Jewish people at the time were looking for a savior,

223
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,500
 someone that was gonna be born of a virgin,

224
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,860
 not exactly the story of any person.

225
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,640
 And so this was part of the sign that would be there.

226
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,500
 Larry King was a famous interviewer, worked for CNN,

227
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,040
 and did as many interviews probably

228
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,220
 as anyone who's ever lived has done.

229
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
 Oprah may give him a run for his money.

230
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,980
 But he was asked, "If you could interview anybody,

231
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,580
 "who would you wanna interview?"

232
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,900
 And he very quickly said, "Jesus Christ."

233
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,140
 And I would have one question.

234
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,220
 "Were you really born of a virgin?"

235
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,620
 That's kind of funny on the surface

236
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,980
 because for me it'd be like,

237
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,420
 man, that's the one that you're gonna get hung up on?

238
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,980
 But Larry King was Jewish

239
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,940
 and he knew that Jesus and the Messiah

240
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,420
 would be born of a virgin.

241
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,540
 And all this takes place, and then it says in verse 24,

242
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,340
 "When Matthew woke up,

243
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,280
 "he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him,

244
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,180
 "and he took Mary home as his wife.

245
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,840
 "But he did not consummate the marriage

246
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,860
 "until she gave birth to his son,

247
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,500
 "and he gave him the name Jesus."

248
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,580
 That is not how anybody sees their wedding night going.

249
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,500
 Did you see that?

250
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,100
 He takes her home, marries her,

251
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,900
 and it says that they don't sleep together

252
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,140
 even though he's his wife until after the birth of his son.

253
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
 What do you do on the wedding night?

254
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,580
 You know, it's like board games?

255
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,540
 You playing Scrabble?

256
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,380
 What are you doing?

257
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,060
 [audience laughs]

258
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,940
 All these different turns in a scandal

259
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,900
 that Jesus and Joseph and Mary

260
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,380
 would carry for the rest of their life.

261
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,380
 I mean, you're growing up in a small town

262
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,820
 where everybody knows,

263
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,380
 and oh, you're the kid whose mom was pregnant by God, right?

264
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,020
 And yet that's exactly what God was up to.

265
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,340
 And through the unplanned pregnancy,

266
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,820
 which was actually the most planned pregnancy of all time,

267
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,300
 God would bring forward into the world a Savior

268
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,300
 to save his people from something very specific, their sins.

269
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,660
 He would send on a mission to deliver them

270
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,480
 not from Rome or from a political empire

271
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,700
 or from some army somewhere.

272
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,060
 He will deliver his people from their sins.

273
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,500
 The first thing that we see about God

274
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,100
 is very simply God sent the Savior.

275
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,980
 He didn't send a list of rules.

276
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,540
 He didn't send a sermon.

277
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,020
 He didn't send a new religion.

278
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,940
 He didn't send a bunch of advice.

279
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,940
 He sent someone to save you and me

280
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,940
 because nothing else other than sending someone

281
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,300
 to save them from their sins would accomplish anything.

282
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,900
 There's no amount of rules, no amount of religion,

283
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,980
 there's no amount of philosophy

284
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,660
 or no amount of advice that somebody can give you

285
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,580
 to provide the biggest solution

286
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,140
 for the biggest problem that you have, which is sin.

287
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,540
 And the fact that you and I have sinned

288
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,100
 against a perfect God through our actions,

289
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,380
 through our thoughts, through our lives in general,

290
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,660
 and God didn't send his Son into the world

291
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,980
 so that you could try harder

292
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,260
 or to be a motivational speaker.

293
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,260
 He sent it to be a Savior from your sins and my sins.

294
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,880
 The first idea that God sent a Savior into the world.

295
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,440
 The name Yeshua, or the name he used to call is Jesus.

296
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,580
 The Hebrew word is Yeshua.

297
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,620
 It's a word that was, is translated Joshua

298
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,560
 most closely in English.

299
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,760
 Joshua was the person who saved the nation of Israel

300
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,340
 in the Old Testament.

301
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,420
 And so Joseph is hearing this and he's told by an angel,

302
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,240
 "And that baby will be the Savior of your people.

303
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,180
 "And you're gonna call him Yeshua."

304
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,120
 And my guess is Joseph thought, of course,

305
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,780
 you know he's gonna show up and this will be the Messiah,

306
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,080
 the military leader.

307
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,880
 He's gonna save them from their sins.

308
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,100
 Joshua, I'm sorry, Joseph wouldn't have been thinking,

309
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,420
 "You know what we need right now?

310
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,060
 "We need a solution for our sins."

311
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,960
 He would have thought, "We have a solution for our sins.

312
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,300
 "It's two miles up the road.

313
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,320
 "It's called a temple.

314
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,640
 "You go in there and when you sin,

315
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,300
 "you sacrifice a goat or you sacrifice a lamb."

316
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,300
 But God knew all of that sacrificial system

317
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,760
 was always pointing to a Savior.

318
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,380
 And that unplanned pregnancy and scandal

319
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,140
 that Joseph was experiencing had been planned

320
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,780
 from the beginning of the world

321
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,540
 'cause God was sending a Savior.

322
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,040
 Now part of the challenge of accepting a Savior

323
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,420
 and being willing to accept someone helping save you

324
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,860
 is you have to believe and understand

325
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,020
 that you actually need rescuing.

326
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,700
 If not, you're not gonna have any openness or willingness

327
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,300
 or desire to be saved from something.

328
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,140
 What do I mean by that?

329
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,220
 The other day, or about a month ago,

330
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,840
 my wife was driving along the road

331
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,420
 and somebody pulled up next to her in the car.

332
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,780
 She's with our two kids.

333
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,900
 And the person next to her in the car

334
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,140
 is screaming at her and waving her hands

335
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,820
 and saying something at her.

336
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,660
 And when you're driving along the road

337
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
 and somebody's doing that, you just think,

338
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,220
 man, this is a crazy person or there's road rage going on

339
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,500
 or what is happening right now?

340
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,620
 And the person is flagging her down and flagging her down

341
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,660
 and she's just like, "All right, kids,

342
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,020
 "we're gonna keep moving, keep moving."

343
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,040
 And he keeps waving at her, waving at her, waving at her.

344
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,140
 And then smoke starts coming out of her engine

345
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,380
 she can see in the front.

346
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,120
 And very quickly, your car begins to break down.

347
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
 The person that was waving at her

348
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,100
 wasn't waving like, "Ah, ah," trying to get her.

349
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,940
 He was saying, "Your car is smoking, it's smoking.

350
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,300
 "I can see the smoke from back here.

351
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,500
 "You can't see it from where you are,

352
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,180
 "but your car is smoking."

353
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,760
 And in a moment, what went from her thinking,

354
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,600
 this person is here to hurt me,

355
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,360
 became this person is here to help me

356
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,320
 because she recognized I have a problem.

357
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,600
 Perhaps one of the biggest barriers

358
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,820
 to people coming to faith

359
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,220
 is not actually believing that you have a problem.

360
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,340
 That you need a savior.

361
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,800
 Because until you get to the place where you go,

362
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,280
 "Man, I am not, I can attempt to try to be a better person.

363
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,080
 "I can attempt to try to earn my way to God,

364
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,240
 "but I will never be good enough if there's a perfect God

365
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,980
 "to live as he would want me to."

366
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,340
 I can't save myself that you're receptive and open to,

367
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,140
 "Oh, I've got a problem, I need help."

368
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,600
 Versus, "Oh man, this is, I don't have a problem

369
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,340
 "and anybody telling me I need to change,

370
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,260
 "they're just trying to harm me."

371
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,020
 But Jesus was sent and Joseph began to realize

372
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,860
 and Mary began to realize to be a savior

373
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,420
 for you, me, and for all people from our sin.

374
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,500
 And then we're told after this,

375
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,220
 about a year later, a year to a year and a half later,

376
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,600
 Matthew 2, verse one,

377
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,700
 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea.

378
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,240
 During the time of King Herod,

379
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,780
 Magi, and you may have wise men,

380
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,220
 from the east came to Jerusalem and they asked,

381
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,120
 "Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?

382
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,380
 "We saw his star when it rose

383
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,760
 "and we have come to worship him."

384
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,160
 So this translation for east would have been

385
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,480
 around the area of Iran or modern day Iran today

386
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,220
 and these Magi, which is a word that's kind of connected

387
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,740
 to magicians or mystics and they were astrologers,

388
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,200
 that they were looking at the stars,

389
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,060
 these men that were coming from the Middle East traveled

390
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,620
 and they saw this star and they came in town and said,

391
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,900
 "Hey, we're trying to find the child that was born

392
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,820
 "because we want to worship him."

393
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,960
 And word begins to break out.

394
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,060
 Now when you think about the wise men,

395
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,000
 here's the problem with the wise men,

396
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,020
 there was a song in 1800s or late 1800s

397
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,980
 that basically ruined how we think about the wise men

398
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,260
 because it was, "We three kings of Ori and Ar,"

399
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,580
 whatever the rest of the song goes.

400
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,180
 And it makes us think there were three kings.

401
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,000
 One, they weren't kings

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,980
 and one, there wasn't three of them.

403
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,300
 There's no reference to three.

404
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,580
 There's three gifts that they bring

405
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,740
 but it was likely a caravan of people

406
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,040
 that had traveled from the Middle East

407
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,820
 and they show up and they're in the city of Jerusalem

408
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,640
 and they go, "Hey, where's the one

409
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,860
 "who's been born King of the Jews?"

410
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,980
 When Herod or King Herod heard this,

411
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,100
 he was disturbed or furious

412
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,080
 and all of Jerusalem with him.

413
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,020
 Now why?

414
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,060
 King Herod was the king of this city of Jerusalem

415
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,720
 and really the area, I think governor of that area.

416
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,160
 But he had a title that was King of the Jews.

417
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,540
 And so this would be him showing up

418
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,300
 and somebody going into UT, Austin and saying,

419
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,460
 "Hey, I'm looking for the one

420
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,180
 "who was born governor of Texas."

421
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,620
 And Governor Abbott being like,

422
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,760
 "What do you mean the one who was?"

423
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,340
 "He's right here, I'm sitting in the Capitol building."

424
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,220
 That's what's happening with Herod.

425
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,180
 And Herod, the reason all of Jerusalem was disturbed

426
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,180
 is Herod was crazy.

427
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,220
 By crazy, I mean crazy.

428
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,340
 He was paranoid.

429
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,940
 He thought constantly people were trying

430
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,060
 to take the throne from him.

431
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,800
 He was brutal and violent.

432
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,200
 He had 10 sons, two of them he thought

433
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,860
 were gonna attempt to take the throne from him.

434
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,140
 So he killed two of his sons.

435
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,460
 He killed one of his wives

436
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,980
 because he thought she was gonna scheme

437
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,180
 with the other children to take his throne.

438
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,780
 He was so violent that when he was making preparations

439
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,580
 for when he was gonna die,

440
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,380
 he ordered that chief officials

441
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,980
 from the highest level of government

442
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,420
 all over the city of Jerusalem,

443
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,860
 the day that Herod died, they were to be put to death

444
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,500
 because he knew, "When I die, no one's gonna cry.

445
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,580
 "So I want there to be mourning in the streets of Jerusalem.

446
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,620
 "So I want you to kill all of them too."

447
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,300
 I mean, he's just a vicious, brutal guy.

448
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,940
 So when Herod is upset that,

449
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,380
 "Hey, there's somebody else claiming to be king,"

450
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,900
 all of Jerusalem was in danger.

451
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,860
 Then Herod called the magi or the wise men secretly

452
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,060
 and he found out from them

453
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,940
 exactly the time the star had appeared.

454
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,540
 And he sent them to Bethlehem.

455
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,000
 And he said, "Go and search carefully for the child.

456
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,780
 "As soon as you find him, report him to me

457
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,380
 "so that I may go too and murder him, no, and worship him."

458
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,340
 You know that's what he's thinking.

459
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,700
 So they go off, so Herod goes, he's like,

460
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,660
 "Oh yeah, they're in Bethlehem.

461
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,200
 "Go see, find them in Bethlehem.

462
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
 "And when you do, I'd love to see him too

463
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,760
 "and come celebrate and bring a housewarming gift.

464
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,860
 "And so come back and let me know."

465
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,920
 And it says this, "The wise men,

466
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,660
 "on coming to the house of Mary and Joseph,

467
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,920
 "they saw the child with his mother Mary,

468
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,220
 "and they bowed down and worshiped him."

469
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,460
 Jesus is, at this point, he's a toddler.

470
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,780
 He's barely able to walk.

471
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,440
 And this little child they see,

472
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,860
 and something is so remarkable,

473
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,740
 they show up and they worship him.

474
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,440
 "They opened their treasures to him

475
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,480
 "and presented him with three gifts,

476
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,600
 "gold, frankincense, and myrrh."

477
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,260
 Come back to that in a second.

478
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,840
 "And having been warned in a dream

479
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,940
 "not to go back to Herod,

480
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,140
 "they returned to their country by another route."

481
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,040
 So these three are this group of men

482
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,360
 that are basically stargazers and mystics and seekers

483
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,660
 are watching stars one day out in the Middle East

484
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,640
 or somewhere in Iran.

485
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,060
 They see a star and they feel called by God

486
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,500
 to go follow that star.

487
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,720
 They show up and they find the savior of the world,

488
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,480
 a man that they had never had any interest in looking

489
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,420
 and searching for and had no idea and understanding of.

490
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,980
 And yet the star shows up and God leads and calls them

491
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,400
 to go find him.

492
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,040
 The other scandal we see here is that God

493
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,800
 takes these mystics, these people who should've been

494
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,280
 the farthest from the first visitors that show up

495
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,360
 at Mary and Joseph's house.

496
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,200
 I mean, think about that.

497
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
 There's a knock at the door and all of a sudden

498
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,560
 a caravan of people from another nation just show up

499
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,400
 and they're like, "Hey, we're here.

500
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
 "We saw the star.

501
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,440
 "We'd love to see your toddler.

502
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
 "How creepy is that?"

503
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,140
 That's exactly what's going on.

504
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,340
 And yet God was doing something.

505
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,460
 God, the second idea we see from this story,

506
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,580
 is seeking all people.

507
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,620
 God is seeking everybody.

508
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,100
 I want you to think about something before.

509
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,540
 You've heard the three wise men before.

510
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,440
 Your mom has it on the nativity set, on the fireplace.

511
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,260
 Why is that story included in the Bible?

512
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,860
 One, because it happened.

513
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,620
 Why would God have that story happen?

514
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,500
 These people, they weren't Jewish.

515
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,120
 They weren't of a Christian faith.

516
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,960
 They were just people.

517
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,560
 They were out watching stargazing

518
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,060
 in the middle of the desert and God calls them.

519
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,360
 I mean, they were seeking that star,

520
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
 but more than that, God was seeking them.

521
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
 He put the star.

522
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
 He moved them to go follow it.

523
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,960
 Because God is a God who seeks all people.

524
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,880
 The message and the reason it's included inside of this

525
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,260
 is because Matthew knew what so many Jewish people

526
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,900
 at the time they were reading and today still believe,

527
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,340
 that God is just a God for the Jewish people,

528
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,460
 that he really cares about the Jews.

529
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,280
 And Matthew's right.

530
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,740
 No, his heart is for all people.

531
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,980
 God's heart is for all people, red, yellow, black, white,

532
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,860
 every race, every nation, every time.

533
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,900
 God's heart is for all people.

534
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,700
 In other words, the belief in Matthew's day

535
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,260
 was that God really, really loved the Jewish people.

536
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,340
 Everybody else, he's kind of like,

537
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,500
 yeah, you guys are okay,

538
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,980
 but I really love the Jewish people.

539
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,660
 Give me a J, give me an E, give me a W.

540
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,740
 That's what I'm all about.

541
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,740
 And Matthew says, no, God's heart is for everyone.

542
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,200
 It always has been.

543
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,200
 And at the birth or the toddler phase of Jesus's life,

544
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,840
 God takes these men who spoke different languages

545
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,800
 with different backgrounds from a different nationality

546
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,400
 and he said, go see 'em.

547
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,040
 Go see the one you were made for.

548
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,680
 And they fall on their face and they worship him.

549
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,940
 Wherever you're at in the room right now,

550
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,640
 God is seeking a relationship with you.

551
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,720
 You're not too far gone, you're past, you're present,

552
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,980
 your future doesn't keep him from wanting you.

553
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,840
 Even if you can't see it or you don't believe it,

554
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,040
 you're not even sure that he's there.

555
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,160
 My daughter is three and we play hide and seek

556
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,880
 and she's at that stage of life when you play hide and seek

557
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,520
 where it's really not that hard to find her

558
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,920
 'cause she'll go hide and she'll just stand

559
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,200
 in the middle of the living room, behind an ornament

560
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,440
 and she does something that's kind of funny

561
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,100
 and of course, you've been around kids,

562
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,100
 you've seen kids do this, where they will cover their eyes

563
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,280
 and they'll be standing in just plain sight

564
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,400
 and you're hiding or they're hiding

565
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,880
 and they're just covering their eyes

566
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,220
 and you have to intentionally not look for them

567
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,280
 or intentionally walk around like,

568
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,960
 oh, where could she be?

569
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,840
 I can't see her.

570
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,440
 Is she over here underneath the mat?

571
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,280
 Is she?

572
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,360
 Because she thinks if I can't see him, he's not there.

573
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,720
 If I can't see him, he's not there and he can't see me.

574
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,040
 It's funny when you're three,

575
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,360
 but a lot of people live their entire life that way.

576
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,780
 They think, man, if I can't see God, he's not there

577
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,160
 and when it's a three-year-old, we can say,

578
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
 oh, that's so silly.

579
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,800
 Just 'cause you can't see him

580
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,120
 doesn't mean that he's not there.

581
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,080
 What if God, even if you can't fully,

582
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,180
 entirely, completely always see him,

583
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,440
 what he's doing, his presence,

584
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,840
 doesn't mean that he's not there?

585
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,120
 Because the Bible would say

586
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,880
 he has been seeking in every breath,

587
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 even the fact that you're in a church on a Tuesday night

588
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,760
 is God seeking, not these people, you,

589
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
 every person in the room,

590
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,000
 every person you've ever met,

591
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
 God is seeking to have a relationship with.

592
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,360
 When you're at the bar and you are so wasted,

593
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,600
 you cannot walk, God is seeking you.

594
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,340
 He's not giving up on you.

595
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,440
 When you find yourself in that place

596
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,520
 where you're deciding, man, I don't know if,

597
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,700
 I can leave and walk out of this house right now

598
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,640
 because of the one-night-stand shame that I have,

599
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,560
 he's seeking you.

600
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,480
 He's never stopped, he never will stop.

601
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,140
 From the moment you took your first breath

602
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,400
 to the moment you take your last,

603
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,920
 has been wanting a relationship with you

604
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,600
 and he was sought after those men

605
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,840
 just like he's seeking after you

606
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,820
 'cause our God seeks every person.

607
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,840
 These men went to Iran.

608
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,560
 You know what's interesting, just quick side note,

609
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,640
 Iran is a predominantly Islamic nation

610
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,840
 and Iran is a place in many Islamic countries

611
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,480
 in the world today where you can literally lose your life

612
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,240
 or be severely outcast from society

613
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,560
 for converting away from Islam,

614
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,520
 from becoming a Christian

615
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
 and yet God continues to seek

616
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,880
 and an awakening is happening

617
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,600
 in Islamic territories and countries

618
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,080
 where people are coming to Jesus

619
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,440
 and you wanna know what one of the most common ways

620
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,280
 they're doing it?

621
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,240
 Through dreams.

622
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,800
 Studies estimate that one in three

623
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,700
 Muslim background Christians come to faith through dreams.

624
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,560
 A man and the stories are crazy.

625
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,920
 There's a book by Tom Doyle named Dreams and Visions

626
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,960
 who's a missionary, runs a ministry in the Middle East.

627
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,040
 The stories are eerily, eerily similar

628
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,600
 where they say and they use the word Isa

629
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,680
 is the translation of the word that they use for Jesus.

630
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,360
 I was sleeping and a man woke me up

631
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,680
 and it was Isa, it was Jesus

632
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,820
 and he said, "I made you, I died for you.

633
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,100
 "You were made to know me."

634
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,300
 And they take the step and they trust in Jesus.

635
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,820
 One in three, I don't know about you.

636
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,520
 There's not a lot of times in a lot of people

637
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,960
 that I interact with where I hear one in 100

638
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,500
 come to faith through dreams.

639
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,760
 For it to be one in three is staggering

640
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,040
 but it tells us the same God who sought the wise men

641
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,880
 is still seeking today, he's still seeking you

642
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,920
 and he still seeks in nations and places

643
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,300
 where they can't talk about Jesus

644
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,560
 or the scriptures are not tolerated

645
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,120
 'cause our God seeks every person.

646
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,180
 Really quickly, finally, they bring these three gifts

647
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,960
 that even those were symbolic.

648
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
 They bring gold, frankincense and myrrh.

649
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,320
 Gold, probably the easiest, clearest

650
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,280
 is a sign of royalty or for a king

651
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,360
 and they're opening these gifts up

652
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,280
 and they're handing them to Mary

653
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,520
 and my guess is she sees the gold and she's like, "Money!"

654
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,220
 Probably never even seen gold before

655
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,600
 and so all of a sudden they've got this gold

656
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,200
 she stores away and then frankincense.

657
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,120
 Frankincense is not really something

658
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,600
 that people give a lot of today

659
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,780
 but it's connected to incense.

660
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,920
 It represents priest or being a priest.

661
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,760
 What's a priest?

662
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,680
 Jesus is called the high priest.

663
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,960
 A priest intercedes or goes to God on behalf of his people.

664
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,280
 Jesus goes to God and it represents

665
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,900
 that Jesus would be the high priest.

666
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,520
 He would be the king, gold,

667
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,960
 he would be the high priest for his people.

668
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,560
 And then myrrh.

669
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,180
 Now myrrh is probably the weirdest of all of them

670
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,760
 and it certainly would have been weird to Mary

671
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,880
 because what was myrrh used for?

672
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,320
 My guess is you don't have a lot of myrrh

673
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
 sitting around your house

674
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,180
 but myrrh was used for embalming the dead.

675
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,200
 In other words, when somebody would die,

676
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,200
 their body would be preserved through putting myrrh over it

677
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,680
 to help provide for burial.

678
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
 And Mary's opening it up.

679
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,620
 You've gotta think, what's going through her head

680
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,920
 if she's going, "Oh man, gold.

681
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,160
 "Now he's going to college, okay,

682
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,040
 "and frankincense, we'll burn some of that later.

683
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
 "It'll smell real good like candle."

684
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,040
 And an embalming fluid.

685
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,960
 This is the king or the epitome of one of those gifts

686
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,400
 where somebody gives it to you and you're like,

687
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,100
 "Oh, oh, this is so nice, this sweater

688
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,320
 "that I will be giving to Goodwill."

689
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
 And you've gotta think that's going on

690
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,440
 but why would they give that to him?

691
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,840
 Because they knew this child,

692
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,000
 unlike every other child who's ever lived,

693
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
 was born to die.

694
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,240
 That he was born to be the savior of the world

695
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,340
 through death.

696
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,640
 And they show up and they give.

697
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,480
 I mean, this would be akin to giving an urn

698
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,660
 for ashes someday.

699
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,500
 And they give it at the birth of Jesus

700
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,800
 because though he was sleeping in a crib,

701
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,400
 one day he would go to a cross

702
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,060
 for every person in this room, listening online,

703
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,360
 and every person that's ever lived.

704
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,460
 And the wise men knew.

705
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,740
 Finally, so we see that God is seeking after all people.

706
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,640
 God sent a savior.

707
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,520
 Then we see perhaps the craziest of the whole story.

708
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,560
 It says this.

709
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,880
 They leave, the Magi leave and head off

710
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,720
 and they go back to their country.

711
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,240
 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord

712
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,060
 appeared to Joseph in a dream.

713
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,440
 "Get up," he said.

714
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,680
 "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt.

715
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,400
 "Stay there until I tell you.

716
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,560
 "For Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."

717
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,240
 So he got up and he took the child and his mother

718
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,080
 during the night and they left for Egypt.

719
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,720
 This is what I mean by it's so much more scandalous

720
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,800
 in Matthew's gospel than in Luke.

721
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,240
 Where Luke talks about the angels and they show up

722
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
 and they worship and glory to God in the highest

723
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,840
 and peace on earth.

724
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,200
 And then Matthew, an angel shows up and he's like,

725
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,000
 "Everybody move out of the house, out of the house,

726
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,240
 "out of the house, head to Egypt."

727
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,000
 And in the middle of the night, they take off to Egypt.

728
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,600
 And another scandal where they would be refugees

729
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,760
 for the next few years.

730
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,480
 Living, running, fleeing from people

731
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,400
 who wanted to take their life.

732
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,560
 When Herod realized, verse 16,

733
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,560
 that he'd been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious.

734
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,240
 And he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem

735
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,340
 in its vicinity, or the surrounding area,

736
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,140
 who were two years old and under,

737
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,080
 in accordance with what he had learned from the Magi.

738
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,760
 So Herod says, "If they're not gonna come back and tell me,

739
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,280
 "I'll get rid of the problem myself,

740
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,200
 "and I will kill every boy under,

741
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,960
 "or two years old and under, inside of the town."

742
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,120
 Think about Mary, who would have known this.

743
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,200
 Who every child that Jesus, 'cause you know, new moms,

744
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,560
 like they haven't changed in 2,000 years.

745
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,080
 You got a baby, moms, they just kind of flock together.

746
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,520
 And so she would have known other moms of other one

747
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,320
 and one and a half year olds that lived

748
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,240
 and were around Jesus.

749
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,560
 Whose baby was killed.

750
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,080
 Because Herod thought, you know what?

751
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,720
 I'm just gonna kill every child there,

752
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,360
 and through death, I'm gonna put an end to Christmas.

753
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,840
 And was unaware that God had a plan the entire time

754
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,400
 to send a child, and through Christmas,

755
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,120
 put an end to death.

756
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,760
 And he told the child, or he told Joseph,

757
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,440
 take Mary and your family and escape.

758
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,280
 Herod was threatened.

759
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,800
 I mean, Herod, why would Herod do this?

760
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,520
 Because Herod, as I've said before,

761
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,280
 he was paranoid of somebody taking the throne from him.

762
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
 He was terrified that somebody, I have a kingdom,

763
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,880
 and I will protect it at all costs,

764
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,000
 even if I have to kill a bunch of toddlers, I will do it.

765
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,160
 Because he didn't want anything

766
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,680
 that could possibly threaten him and his kingdom.

767
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,280
 The irony, and the sad thing,

768
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,320
 is that Herod didn't understand that Jesus showed up,

769
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,960
 and he wasn't just a gift for Jewish people,

770
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,120
 or just a gift for certain people.

771
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,560
 He was to be a savior for all people, including Herod.

772
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,360
 In Luke chapter two, when the angels do show up,

773
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,800
 they say this, in Luke chapter two, verse 10,

774
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,920
 "Do not be afraid, I give you good news,"

775
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,840
 talking about the birth of Jesus, "to the shepherds.

776
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,200
 "This will cause great joy for all the people."

777
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,360
 This is a good gift for all people everywhere.

778
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,980
 Herod, this isn't something that's a threat.

779
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,920
 This is a gift, the savior of the world.

780
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,880
 But Herod thought, and this saying,

781
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,380
 "I see Jesus as a threat to my life,

782
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,280
 "not as a gift to my life."

783
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,360
 What's funny is this still happens all the time,

784
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,540
 where people think God, who's here to give good

785
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,620
 and bring good about, and they see him as,

786
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,500
 "Man, I don't know that I wanna let you in all of my life."

787
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,080
 It's like this, my daughter, like I said,

788
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
 it's just something with kids when they're young,

789
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,700
 and she's at that stage,

790
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,760
 I think she was two in this picture I'm about to show you,

791
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,100
 where we'll go see Santa, and when we go see Santa,

792
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,080
 kids do what they do when they're like three and under,

793
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,240
 and they just freak out.

794
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,080
 It kinda makes sense.

795
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,480
 They've never seen white hair before.

796
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,840
 They're like, "What happened to this guy?

797
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,920
 "And he's wearing a red robe, and that's just,

798
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,840
 "it's creepy to me."

799
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,000
 And so we'll go see Santa,

800
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,080
 and it just comes into territory.

801
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,160
 This happened with all of our kids.

802
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,840
 She's sitting on Santa's lap, and she's,

803
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,200
 this is like the calm state.

804
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,160
 This is like, "All right, quick, take the picture."

805
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,700
 And she's just panicking, 'cause she can't,

806
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,420
 she's terrified, and she doesn't understand,

807
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,560
 "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Santa's a nice man.

808
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,640
 "He's gonna give you gifts.

809
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,680
 "Santa's a good, sit on his knee, it's okay.

810
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,940
 "It's gonna be okay.

811
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,880
 "He wants to give good things to you."

812
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,120
 She just sees him as a terrifying,

813
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,560
 I don't even know what a two-year-old thinks

814
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,320
 of a person that close, and wants to be away from him.

815
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,400
 It's funny that Herod had a similar posture

816
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,000
 towards Jesus, towards God.

817
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,940
 And I don't see him as something

818
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,240
 that's gonna bring good in my life.

819
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,900
 He's a threat.

820
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,080
 But Herod's not alone.

821
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,920
 There's a lot of people in the room

822
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,480
 that they see it that way.

823
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,240
 I mean, some of us spend years and years of our life

824
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,200
 where you see God as a threat to you.

825
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,860
 You see him not as like, "He's here to give good things.

826
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,720
 "He's here to bring good things into your life."

827
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,680
 You see him as a threat that, "Oh, man, he's,

828
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,080
 "I don't want him too close.

829
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,960
 "If he gets too close, man, I don't wanna have God,

830
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,920
 "he's a threat.

831
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,660
 "Like, if I go all in with Jesus,

832
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,020
 "it's gonna threaten how I wanna live.

833
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,940
 "It means I'm gonna have to stop

834
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,100
 "just partying all the time.

835
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,200
 "Or it means I'm gonna have to change the way

836
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,340
 "that I dress, or it means I'm gonna have

837
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,820
 "to actually break up with this person

838
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,180
 "because God's gonna come in and be like,

839
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,100
 "No, that's not okay.

840
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,080
 "Or it means I'm gonna have to stop having sex,

841
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,540
 "or one-night stands, or sleeping around,

842
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,220
 "or doing what I wanna do with my life.

843
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,240
 "And so not right now.

844
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,780
 "I'll get serious about God someday,

845
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,700
 "when I'm in my 30s, when I wanna settle down,

846
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,920
 "and I wanna raise kids in the church.

847
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,020
 "But right now, I wanna live my life, these are my 20s."

848
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,020
 And it's 'cause you see God as a threat, not as a gift,

849
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,860
 not as one who wants to bring good in your life,

850
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,740
 but you can trust.

851
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,500
 And the Son of God, the Savior of the world, showed up.

852
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,620
 And He was five miles away

853
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:42,300
 in the home of Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem,

854
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,500
 five miles away from Herod.

855
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,060
 And He missed Him because He saw it.

856
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,900
 It's a threat.

857
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,820
 And if you have bought the idea that God is here

858
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,380
 to steal, take, rob, keep from,

859
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,400
 you, like Herod, have bought a lie.

860
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,260
 And like a two-year-old, you're trying to explain,

861
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,000
 no, sin is, He gives good things, God.

862
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,820
 He gives good things.

863
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,020
 He wants to bring good things.

864
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,980
 Any part of you that goes,

865
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,380
 "I don't know if I want Him that close,"

866
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:22,340
 has bought a lie about God.

867
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,660
 Who He is, His love,

868
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,260
 even what He just wants in your life,

869
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,220
 like any good parent, He wants good things.

870
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,220
 Herod claimed that he wanted to worship Jesus.

871
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,820
 So the Magi, "Hey, you guys worship Him.

872
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,140
 "I wanna worship Him too."

873
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,700
 But those were just words, a lip service.

874
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,420
 He didn't really wanna worship Him.

875
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,420
 He didn't have a genuine, real faith.

876
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,820
 I was thinking about Christmas and Christmas trees,

877
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,220
 and got these two trees that are up here,

878
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,860
 and really similar, right?

879
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,980
 Same tree skirt, same decorations,

880
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,140
 but there's one key difference.

881
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,860
 This one is real, as in it was actually a tree

882
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,380
 that was cut down.

883
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,700
 It's got life that is inside of it.

884
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,340
 There's water in the bottom watering it,

885
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,300
 because there's life that's inside of it.

886
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,420
 And this one is fake.

887
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,420
 It may look similar, it may look like it's real,

888
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,400
 but it's fake.

889
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,380
 There's nothing tree, actual tree about it.

890
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,700
 There's no wood that makes it up.

891
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,340
 It's made in a factory somewhere.

892
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,940
 Even though it looks similar on the outside,

893
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,420
 and it's decorated in a similar way,

894
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,620
 and they've got a lot of similarities,

895
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,740
 there's a huge difference.

896
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,300
 One is real, and one is fake.

897
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,260
 And I don't want you to live another day of your life

898
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,340
 if you're in the room with a fake faith.

899
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,380
 There's no actual life inside of you,

900
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,580
 and your life looks pretty pretty.

901
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,180
 You got a good car, you got a good job.

902
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,920
 People look at you and they think you're a nice guy,

903
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,140
 a nice girl, but you've never actually trusted in Jesus.

904
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,460
 You could say the words, you may know some Bible verses.

905
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,860
 You grew up in Catholic school, you grew up in church,

906
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,820
 and you know the stories, but you don't actually believe it.

907
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,220
 In fact, you're at that place where like,

908
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
 hey, you're like, I don't want God.

909
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,060
 Not yet.

910
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,820
 I don't wanna change.

911
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,220
 I don't want him in my life.

912
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,180
 (soft music)

913
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,820
 Or you're at a place where you think

914
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,100
 you can earn your way to God by how you behave,

915
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,500
 or you can't have a relationship with God

916
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,540
 because of what you have done.

917
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,140
 All of those, fake faith.

918
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,360
 True faith has life inside of it.

919
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,580
 How does life come to live inside of someone?

920
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,500
 It comes by the moment where they say,

921
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,020
 Jesus, you on the cross,

922
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,280
 you died for everything I've ever done.

923
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,100
 You came not to be the provider of a second chance,

924
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,340
 you came to be the savior of my sin,

925
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,620
 and you gave your life for me, and I believe that.

926
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,820
 And you rose from the dead, and the payment went through.

927
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,460
 You are more than enough, and I will stand before God,

928
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,580
 and I will live with him forever.

929
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,860
 Not because of how good I am,

930
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,900
 because of what you did for me.

931
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,280
 You're my savior.

932
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,620
 And that's a real faith.

933
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,780
 Tragedy is Herod's kingdom, it came to an end.

934
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,820
 He was fighting the inevitable.

935
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,960
 In fact, the very next verse, it says, "And Herod died.

936
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,940
 And the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream

937
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,540
 and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother,

938
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,060
 and go back to the land of Israel.

939
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,360
 Those who were trying to kill him have died.'"

940
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,660
 The third idea from the text that we see

941
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,220
 is that God sacrificed his son.

942
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,900
 Herod goes in and sacrifices all of these children.

943
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:41,000
 Ironically, God's plan would later, and Herod did so,

944
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,780
 put to death human life to protect his kingdom.

945
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:54,700
 God allowed Jesus to have death take his life

946
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,940
 to protect you and the world,

947
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,340
 because God so loved the world,

948
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,340
 he gave his only son that whoever believes

949
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,540
 and accepts the scandalous payment of the life of God

950
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,440
 will not perish but have eternal life.

951
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,460
 One thing, and I'll close here, it's ironic,

952
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,100
 as we just conclude, our God sent the savior,

953
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,500
 our God is seeking all people,

954
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,260
 and our God saves by sacrificing and by sacrificing his son.

955
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,060
 In this season, we gather together and we have gifts.

956
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,420
 In your house or maybe in your family's house,

957
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,780
 you'll get a tree.

958
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,180
 And underneath the tree, we'll put Christmas gifts,

959
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,820
 and most people put Christmas gifts that are on there.

960
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,540
 And when you look at those gifts, you'll try to evaluate,

961
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,700
 I wonder what could be in that one.

962
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,180
 You know what some of the most valuable gifts

963
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,300
 that come in my house,

964
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,440
 and often that are represented in my house,

965
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,420
 they sit on a tree.

966
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,260
 And what do I mean by that?

967
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,540
 I mean, you'll get like an envelope or grandma will sit,

968
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,860
 people who are like, "No, I'm not mailing gifts,

969
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,780
 "here's some cash."

970
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,340
 And they'll put a check or they put something in an envelope,

971
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,380
 or maybe it's a little box,

972
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,780
 and it's like a wedding ring or something of great value.

973
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,220
 It may not be as big as the things underneath,

974
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,060
 but the most valuable things often are the ones

975
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,020
 that hang on a tree.

976
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:22,100
 And it's so fitting, and it's seasoned and ironic, honestly.

977
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,060
 Where all over the country and all over the world,

978
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,980
 people will get trees and they will hang things on it

979
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,900
 to celebrate the birth of the one who came,

980
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,660
 to hang on a tree for them.

981
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,540
 And just like the most valuable gifts,

982
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,420
 at least in my house,

983
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,940
 are often the ones hanging on a tree.

984
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,220
 The most valuable gift God could ever give

985
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,580
 was the life of Jesus,

986
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,260
 who hung not on a Christmas tree,

987
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,540
 but hung on a tree on a hill called Calvary,

988
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,980
 for you and for me and for every person who's ever lived

989
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,180
 and to pay for their sins.

990
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,300
 First Peter chapter two, verse 24 says,

991
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,860
 "He, Jesus, bore our sins in his body on a tree,

992
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,200
 "that we may die to sin, live to righteousness.

993
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,780
 "By his wounds, you have been healed."

994
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,780
 The scandal of Christmas is that God,

995
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,340
 rich in love and mercy,

996
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,140
 would give the most valuable gift imaginable

997
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,940
 and hang it on a tree for you and for me.

998
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,140
 And if you've never had a moment where you accepted that,

999
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,380
 God is extending the greatest gift

1000
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,420
 you will ever receive in your life,

1001
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,380
 but he will not force you to accept it.

1002
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,180
 You have to decide, I believe that, I receive that.

1003
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,660
 You died for me.

1004
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,100
 And tonight is your night if you have it.

1005
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,300
 And when you do, all of heaven, we're told,

1006
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,280
 erupts in joy,

1007
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,220
 because one who is made for God

1008
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,280
 has stepped into the relationship with him,

1009
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,860
 through Christ, by believing and accepting it.

1010
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,940
 Let me pray.

1011
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,460
 Father, thank you for the scandal of the cross.

1012
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,020
 I pray for anyone in this room

1013
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,820
 who has bought the lie that you are a threat

1014
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,100
 there to take from them,

1015
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,900
 rather than bring them life,

1016
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,540
 you would pierce and break through with the truth.

1017
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,660
 You're a good, loving, perfect father.

1018
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,820
 I pray for anyone who's never accepted that free gift

1019
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,660
 and tonight you would allow their heart right now,

1020
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,540
 where they are, to have it pressed on them by you.

1021
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,420
 And they would accept by grace,

1022
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,820
 through faith, what you have done on their behalf.

1023
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,100
 Thank you that you lived the life we couldn't

1024
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,220
 and you died the death for us.

1025
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,940
 You are the one who saves us from our sins

1026
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,380
 and we worship you now in song, amen.

1027
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:09,380
