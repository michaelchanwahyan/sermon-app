[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:15.040]   All right, what's up, friends of the room?
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.760]   Check, check, check.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.880]   Friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, Arkansas, wherever
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.560]   you are joining us from, glad that you are tuning in as we
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.280]   wrap up this self-care series.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.160]   Let's go.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.920]   Got a treadmill on stage, joggers on, game time.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.120]   Hey, any iPhone fans in this room?
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.440]   Love it.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.400]   Any Android people?
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:50.000]   You guys, you guys are dismissed right now.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800]   That's how we're going to start.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.600]   You're ruining text message groups everywhere, OK?
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.320]   We can't-- and we're all upset about it.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.640]   So when this is done, you are putting your phone on this
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.040]   stage and getting an iPhone, because we
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.840]   want to be able to name our group texts,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.040]   and it's really frustrating.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.200]   I love this thing, man.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.560]   I don't know.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.040]   I've never actually used an Android,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.760]   so I'm just going to speak as though they
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.680]   work kind of like an iPhone.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.120]   But this thing is amazing.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120]   I mean, the fact that we live in 2019
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.920]   has some serious perks to it.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.720]   I mean, you think about days when
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.480]   you had the Razr, that huge car phone that you drive around.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.960]   It's like a huge brick that people would answer and talk on
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.320]   or Zack Morris style.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.080]   And just how the smartphone has so changed the game.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.600]   Like, as I was just thinking through,
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.560]   the things that I can do while I'm standing in line
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.280]   at Walgreens are unbelievable compared
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.040]   to what you would have to log on to the internet.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.640]   Remember dial-up internet?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.680]   Anybody old enough to remember that?
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800]   Where you would just wait for all the--
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.240]   I can't even emulate the sounds--
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.040]   to come online and America Online
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.200]   and all the different AIM.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.280]   But today, you can be standing in line at CVS,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.520]   and you could be like, man, I think I'm out of soap at home.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.760]   And this soap is more expensive here.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.160]   I'm just going to order Amazon Prime now,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.560]   and it'll be there in two hours.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.680]   Like, you can pull your phone out right now.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440]   You could have groceries waiting for you when you get home.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.560]   Think about that.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.840]   The fact that you get home, there's no food, no problem.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   You got Uber Eats.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.280]   You got Favor.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   You got options.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.520]   The fact that you have Waze app.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.560]   Any Waze fans in the house?
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.800]   We are excited about Waze.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.200]   Let's go.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.600]   No traffic for you.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.560]   The fact that, like, you can wonder, hey,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.120]   what are the symptoms of measles?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.400]   I don't have to wonder.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.280]   I can look them up.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.520]   WebMD, it's on my phone.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.720]   I've got access.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.560]   I can find out, hey, what position did Ryan Gosling play
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.600]   in Remember the Titans?
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.920]   I don't have to wonder anymore.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.160]   I can just immediately-- it's all right here.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.600]   Wherever you're sitting right now,
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.560]   you have access to that type of information.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.160]   You want to know how to cook crawfish?
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   Just YouTube it.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.600]   You want to know what the best sushi place in town?
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.400]   Yelp.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   I mean, just all the different things
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.560]   that are at your fingertips, from just what's
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.120]   the population of Vermont to who invented the Oreo,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.880]   it's only a couple clicks away.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.000]   And I don't know--
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.560]   or I do know I am not the only one who loves this thing.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.840]   Because if you pay any attention--
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.240]   like, just next time you're at a restaurant, look around.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.960]   And if you see, like, a group of friends,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.080]   what are they all doing?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.680]   The same thing.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.240]   Everyone is, like, sitting there like this,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.560]   either talking to people around them or just looking up,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.120]   like, hey, what's the best thing that the tips on Yelp
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.800]   is telling me to eat here right now?
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.320]   You drive around.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.200]   I mean, the scariest thing is next time you're
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.480]   in the car during the day, look around.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.080]   Everyone is driving and texting all the time.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.000]   Like, everyone is on their phone.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.280]   It's terrifying.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.120]   But we're all constantly like, oh, man, I'm looking this up,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.760]   or I'm checking my Instagram likes,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   or I'm checking on what's a faster way to get there,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   or just looking up random information on Wikipedia
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.400]   and the, like, vortex that you get sucked into there
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.200]   after click after click.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.600]   But the crazy thing is as much as you're able to get done,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.880]   as much as this is, like, added benefit to our lives--
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.160]   I know, at least for me, it comes at a real cost.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.680]   Like, if I'm not careful, this thing
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   will distract me from the people I'm around.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.400]   It'll distract you from ever been, like, at a place,
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.800]   at a concert maybe, or you're at, like, an amazing,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.600]   a beautiful place, a beautiful environment.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.360]   And instead of focusing on the music and the concert,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.480]   you're just trying to take a video
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.680]   to make sure that you can upload it to your Insta stories,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.920]   or you're at, like, some beautiful,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.800]   here's the Grand Canyon, instead of really, like,
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.400]   taking it in and, man, God, this is amazing.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.440]   You're over there trying to choose
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.040]   what filter to put on it.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   As much as this thing adds to our life,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.720]   it also comes at a cost.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.960]   And I know for me, it comes at a cost
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.440]   of some pretty important arenas in life.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.280]   Relationally, it can distract you
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.760]   from the people that you're around, from me,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.840]   wife, children, from you, friends, relationships,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.400]   family members, how much of your time,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.960]   or of our time when you go home for family on vacation,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.120]   are you spent just kinda, like,
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.520]   checking out what there is to do around you
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   and what everyone else is doing?
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.880]   And the reason I start there is 'cause tonight,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.400]   we're gonna talk about a subject
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.680]   about things in life that drain the life out of you.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.760]   And I'm convinced, just after studying it,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.720]   how much this is draining the life out of you.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.000]   It allows us to get, really, sometimes,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.720]   the most out of life while sacrificing
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.440]   the most important things.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.920]   And so what I wanna do right now
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.880]   is have everyone in the room take their phone out,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.080]   even the Android people.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.440]   And I wanna challenge you to do something
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.360]   we've never done on the boards.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.440]   I want you to turn your phone off.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.920]   Not put it on airplane, I know,
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.560]   it just gasps, went out everywhere.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.880]   It's like, what, oh my gosh, are you kidding me?
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.400]   What kinda church is this?
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.160]   Turn off the phone, it's gonna be a short message,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.520]   like 30 minutes.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.800]   And I know what you're thinking.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.680]   Hey, I'm being serious.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.800]   Take your phone out right now, turn it off.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.120]   And you're thinking, as you're nervously moving around,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.000]   there's even a phobia.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Here's what's crazy.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.960]   We all are panicked about, oh my gosh,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.200]   what am I gonna do without my phone?
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.320]   There's even a phobia been named nomophobia.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.680]   No mobile phobia.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.920]   Here you go, here you go, here you go.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.640]   But turn it off, and you're wondering,
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.920]   what if he texts me back?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.760]   That text message is gonna wait for you
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.040]   when you turn it back on.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.960]   What if your mom calls?
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.640]   There's gonna be a voicemail waiting for you.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.760]   You can call her back.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.560]   Whenever those things don't get lost.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.000]   Jason Mraz, did you get my message?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.160]   It is not a thing.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.320]   They stay around and stay on the phone.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.600]   You're probably even more likely thinking,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.960]   what if you're boring, David?
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   What am I gonna do?
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.000]   That's fair.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.960]   And that may be a real challenge,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.360]   but at least it's gonna be a shorter time.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.240]   Or maybe you're like,
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.280]   well, what if there's a national emergency?
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.960]   We've thought through everything, folks,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.720]   because Billy, our tech director,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.320]   he's gonna keep his phone on so you don't have to.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.520]   And we've got friends.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.600]   For your service, Billy.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.120]   Outside of the room who are committed to letting us know
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.560]   if there's a national emergency,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.280]   if the US decides to go to war,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.400]   he's gonna let us know,
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.560]   and we'll make sure to pass that on to you
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.200]   for the next 30 minutes.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.160]   I just want you to tune in as we talk about things
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.960]   that drain the life out of us.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.200]   And the good news will be,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.400]   you won't be draining the life out of your phone
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.200]   while you're doing that, 'cause it'll be off.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.440]   But just like it is possible for a battery in your phone
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.040]   to get drained, many of us walked into the room tonight,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.840]   and there are things, in addition to the phone,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.240]   and our constant distractions that come from it,
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.280]   that are draining the life out of you.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.920]   They're draining the joy out of you, the peace out of you,
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.360]   and it is not the way that God wants you to live.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.000]   And so we wanted to wrap up this series
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.200]   by just covering some of the things,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.440]   the most key arenas, or some of the most key arenas
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.760]   where your life is just being sucked out of you,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.960]   because there is a solution,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   and God's word discusses how you and I can experience
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.320]   not being drained of life, but being filled with it.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.280]   So tonight, we're gonna cover two drains,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.440]   and then really one thing that if you and I commit to it,
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.320]   is the thing that ultimately fills
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.080]   and sustains us in life.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.360]   And it's gonna come from a story
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.520]   that is found in Luke chapter 10.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.400]   If you grew up in church,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.040]   you may be familiar with this story.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.440]   It's a story that involves two sisters.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.360]   And inside of this story,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.760]   one of the sisters gives us two examples
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.840]   of some of the things that still today
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.280]   drain the life out of you and drain the life out of me.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.760]   And then the other sister gives us the thing
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.160]   that all throughout the Bible, really,
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.240]   it's indicated that if you and I commit to this one thing,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   you will consistently experience being charged,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.000]   energized in life.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.640]   No matter the circumstances that you face,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.720]   no matter what you walk through.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.760]   So we're gonna look at these two things that drain us,
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.900]   and then one thing that helps sustain us
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.620]   in the midst of that found in Luke chapter 10
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.680]   will be in verse 38.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.600]   If you don't have a Bible,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.640]   the verses will be up on the screen.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.680]   If you do not own a Bible,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.480]   there's Bibles out in the Welcome Center here in Dallas.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.960]   They should be someone Fort Worth,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   and the rest of you guys are on your own.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.080]   But there is an app for that,
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.640]   but you shouldn't be using your Bible app
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.800]   'cause it'll be up on the screens.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.780]   I'm talking to you too and all the locations.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.700]   Make sure that your phone is off.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.900]   We'll start in verse 38.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.160]   As Jesus and his disciples were on their way,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.100]   he came to a village where a woman named Martha
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.140]   opened her phone to him.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.320]   (laughing)
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.020]   Oh man, I can't go without the phone talking about it.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.200]   (laughing)
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.400]   Opened her phone to Jesus.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.200]   Martha, you are always opening that phone.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.400]   Martha, Martha.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.640]   That was for some of you.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.480]   All right, I digress.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.720]   Okay, a woman named Martha opened her home to him.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.800]   She had a sister named Mary
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.660]   But Martha was distracted by all the preparations
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.280]   that had to be made.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.840]   She came to him and asked,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.000]   "Lord, don't you care," this is Martha speaking,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.680]   "that my sister has left me to do all of the work
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.240]   "while she's sitting there at your feet?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.040]   "Tell her to help me."
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.720]   Martha, Martha, Jesus said.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.220]   The Lord answered,
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.520]   "You are worried and upset about many things,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.540]   "but few things are needed, or indeed only one.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.380]   "Mary has chosen what is better,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.480]   "and it will not be taken away from her."
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.240]   So if you grew up in church, you may have heard this story.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.160]   Jesus goes through town, shows up,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.400]   and Martha, who has this house,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.280]   invites Jesus and all of his disciples into the home,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.480]   and Jesus begins kinda teaching the disciples,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.120]   and Mary, her sister, is not helping her put together,
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.440]   like, what are we gonna serve Jesus
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.120]   and his friends or his boys?
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.320]   Do we have some pita bread, some hummus?
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.520]   What are we gonna give these guys?
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.080]   Mary's in there just sitting at the feet of Jesus
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.840]   while Martha, who again owns the home,
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.560]   is the one preparing and going through
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.920]   all the different preparations that need to take place.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.760]   Comes to Jesus and says, "Hey, what's the deal?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.900]   "My sister in here is basically being a hippie
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.000]   "sitting at your feet, and I need some help in the kitchen
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.040]   "sweeping things up.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.120]   "Will you tell her to help me?"
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.440]   Begins bossing Jesus around.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.560]   Jesus says, "Hey, she's chosen something better
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.860]   "than all the things that are weighing
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.260]   "and distracting you down."
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.600]   When I read that story, initially,
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.880]   there's something about Martha that I resonate with,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.760]   and probably a lot of us do,
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.000]   partly because we live in a world
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.160]   that everyone celebrates Martha,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.840]   or celebrates not Martha in this story,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.200]   but kinda Martha's in general.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.040]   What do I mean by Martha?
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.880]   I mean like a go-getter.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.120]   Like, Martha's the girl that you want on your staff.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.860]   She's the girl that you wanna work with,
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.640]   work alongside, she's getting after it.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.260]   I mean, she owns the home.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.940]   She's got the mortgage, she's paying the bills.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.240]   Mary's a freeloader sitting in there.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.720]   There's a lot to respect about Martha.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.920]   I feel like Martha's somebody that has drive and ambition,
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.020]   she's getting after it, and Mary's just over there
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.220]   like a wallflower, sitting around doing nothing.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.940]   And I look at Martha, and I'm like,
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.640]   "Man, I feel for Martha."
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.640]   But the tragedy is that in trying to get
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.840]   all these different things done,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.200]   she was distracted from the one who's most important,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.160]   and it ended up costing her.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.960]   And the same thing is relevant for you and for me.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.160]   That although there's some things that are qualities,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.560]   and the Bible here in the story,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.560]   the point of the story is not that,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.720]   "Hey, you shouldn't ever get things done,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.160]   "and have drive, and have ambition for things."
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.840]   The point of the story is to not max out your life
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   and miss out on what is most important.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.320]   And Martha, we're told, the first adjective described of her
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.640]   was she was distracted by many things.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.000]   The word distracted is the first thing
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.960]   I just wanna talk about, the first drain
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.720]   that is gonna come for you in your life,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.760]   the first thing that's sucking energy out of you right now
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.640]   is the idea of you being distracted.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.720]   What's distracted mean?
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.360]   It literally is a word that means pulled
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.920]   in many different directions.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.800]   There's a French word for torture that was called,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.660]   if they really wanted to torture someone,
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.080]   they would distract them, and they would tie ropes
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.880]   to each of their limbs, their legs and their arms,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.040]   and they would have horses run in every direction
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.280]   and pull them apart, and it was called distraction.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.120]   It means pulled in different directions.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.560]   The first thing that is gonna drain
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.400]   and suck the life out of you is being pulled
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.240]   in a million different directions
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.200]   at the expense of something or the things
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.440]   that are most important in your life.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.560]   The first thing I just wanna talk about
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.320]   is being drained from distractions.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.240]   For Martha, what a tragedy that the Son of God,
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.760]   the most important person in all of human history,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.120]   comes into her house, and instead of focusing on Him,
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.520]   she's distracted by, you know, I need to make sure
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.960]   that I'm cleaning the floors in here,
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.520]   getting something to eat, all the different preparations,
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.140]   and misses out on being around Jesus,
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.980]   the one that all of human history
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.080]   would restart the calendar around,
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.960]   because distractions, distractions that were draining
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.160]   and pulling at you, and here's where this is so relevant
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.460]   and more relevant than ever before.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.040]   It's like you are constantly being distracted
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.120]   and gonna be tempted to be distracted away
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.200]   from focusing on Jesus, focusing on your faith,
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.280]   focusing on the things that really matter,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.600]   because not only did you walk in here
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.160]   and social media's pulling at you,
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.320]   and there's a million different things
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.800]   that you should be checking right now,
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.220]   million different things you should be focusing on,
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.960]   some of you already turned your phone back on.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.160]   You're like, ah, it's been a minute and a half,
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.120]   can't take it anymore, and they're pulling
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.220]   for all of your attention, and if that wasn't enough,
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.320]   there's just things in life that are gonna constantly
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.360]   be pulling for your attention.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.840]   They're not even bad things.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.100]   They're realities of things.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.000]   Graham, you come up here, and I'll show you what I mean.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.960]   There's things that all of us kinda came into the room
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.080]   and whether it's our job, whether it's where we work,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.560]   they're gonna pull for our attention,
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.000]   and if you are not careful to focus
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.100]   in the midst of distraction, your life,
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.440]   on the things that matter most,
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.680]   you may max out your life, but you will miss out
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.900]   on the things that are most important,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.360]   because you can only handle so much,
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.480]   and so the key, or the remedy, the solution
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.120]   for being drained from distraction is focusing,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.000]   focusing your life not on the things
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.520]   that you need to get done, not on your to-do list,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.400]   but focusing your life every single day,
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.600]   what are the things Jesus wants me to do?
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.960]   At the end of the day, I'm not responsible
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.200]   for getting every single thing that I need
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.600]   to get done on my to-do list and all my car registration,
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.720]   and when am I gonna do my taxes,
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.520]   and all the different million things
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.200]   that are fighting for your attention.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.560]   If it comes at the expense of you doing
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.000]   what Jesus wants you to do, and I'm gonna talk about it
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.800]   in a second what those are gonna be,
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.480]   but in this scenario, I just had Graham jump on here,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.240]   where this is a treadmill, and the treadmill represents
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.200]   kind of that all of the life, Billy,
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.640]   I don't think this is working.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.200]   Okay, Graham's gonna run on a broken treadmill
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.920]   for a second, and if he begins to run,
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.000]   (laughing)
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.640]   hey, this guy is a Martha, I'll tell you
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.800]   that much right there, he is not settling
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.960]   for this thing not working, I don't know
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.860]   that it's gonna work, Billy, we good?
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.760]   Okay, so here's what would happen, in life,
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.880]   let's say this treadmill is moving all at the same pace,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.560]   or let's say it's moving, life in general,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   it's gonna move at five miles an hour, six miles an hour,
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.000]   it's not moving in general right now, thank you, Billy,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   you saved us from war, but you didn't save the treadmill,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.680]   and so Graham's gonna pick up different things,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.640]   but he's limited in what he can carry,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.960]   like he's gonna run, life is gonna run
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.880]   at the same pace for all of us,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.080]   all of us have 24 hours a day,
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.000]   every single person in this room,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.400]   including Graham, including Beyonce,
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.080]   everybody's got 24 hours a day and seven days a week,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.800]   and so you've gotta decide, hey, what are the things
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.680]   that I'm going to carry, the things that I can handle,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.080]   so Graham's, he's got his Bible,
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.420]   he's got a commitment to God's word,
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.740]   then he's candle, he's gotta put attention towards a job,
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.840]   there's his work represented, here's a relationship maybe,
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.980]   where he's got some box of chocolates and dating,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.280]   and he's focused, hopefully he's got a girl,
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.800]   then he needs to be involved in church,
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.640]   and he's carrying that, and not,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.360]   the relationship's falling apart already,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.880]   and he's got his side hustle job here,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.280]   then you need to have some sort of health life
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.760]   and fitness and maybe a social life over here,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.800]   and then you got Topo Chico, not sure why that's in there,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.720]   then we've got a dog, you gotta care for,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.640]   and a million different things,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   and then on top of all of that,
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.880]   he's got social media that's gotta get his attention,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.160]   Graham, if you could run a little harder
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.660]   and try a little harder, maybe that dating relationship
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.360]   would work out a little more in your favor.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.660]   Wow, and you saved the phone.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.560]   Way to go, isn't that life?
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.680]   Everything falls apart, but you hold onto the phone.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.060]   Man, that illustration went perfectly.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:01.360]   But here's the point, you can only carry so many things.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.720]   You can only carry so many things,
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.220]   so the choice is what am I going to prioritize,
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.220]   what are the things that I'm not gonna let go of?
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.880]   Because if I try to carry too many things,
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.640]   you're gonna drop something,
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.160]   and often you either don't have a choice
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.040]   of the things that you drop,
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.080]   or you end up dropping the things that are most important.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.320]   The first thing to go is your relationship with God,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.240]   or maybe it's the connection to church or other believers,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.720]   your relationship to people around you,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.880]   and you have got to focus,
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.000]   not on all the things that you need to get done,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.200]   but every day asking the question,
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.380]   Lord, what does Jesus want me to do today?
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.980]   What does it look like to live out or to fulfill the things,
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.400]   not all that's on my to-do list
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.660]   and everything hanging over my head,
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.860]   but just today, what does God want from me?
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.160]   Here's some of the things that God wants from you today,
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.760]   for you to walk in relationship with him,
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.920]   for you to know him, for you to spend time in his word.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.280]   Here's something else that Jesus,
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.160]   oh, we all came into the room,
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.620]   and what, oh, we have all these different things
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.260]   we need to get done, and our side hustles,
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.200]   and we need to make sure that we're posting
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.720]   and keeping up with all the people around us,
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.360]   but what does Jesus want from me today?
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.720]   Not those things.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.360]   He wants a relationship with you.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.140]   He wants you focused on caring for people around you.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.200]   Another thing Jesus wants, he wants you to sleep.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.320]   He wants you to rest.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.040]   Psalm 127, verse two says this,
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.440]   that it is in vain to stay up late into the night
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.160]   and rise early, toiling for food to eat,
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.300]   because God, that's he,
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.820]   some of you guys should memorize this verse,
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.040]   some of you maybe already have,
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.000]   he gives to his beloved even in their sleep,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.380]   or he grants sleep to those who he loves.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.400]   That at the end of the day, you've got a million things
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   that are gonna fight for your attention
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.360]   in the question before you, in the question before you.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.920]   Jesus, what do you want from me right now?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.480]   'Cause my mind is racing of all the different distractions
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.440]   that are fighting for my attention constantly,
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.480]   and I have the choice.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.920]   Here's where I'm at, empowered and have the choice.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.980]   What am I going to give my attention towards?
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.840]   What am I gonna prioritize my attention?
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.960]   Am I gonna choose to prioritize,
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.800]   I'm not letting go of my relationship with God,
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.320]   I'm not letting go of my relationship with other believers,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.480]   I'm gonna prioritize those things, even if it costs me,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.100]   even if that means changing jobs.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.600]   Because week after week, I talk with many of you
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.760]   who come down and you'll share about,
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.920]   hey, this is where I'm at in life,
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.840]   and you're working 80 to 90 hours a week,
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.920]   and you're like, I can't really serve,
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.280]   I can't get plugged into a church,
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.920]   I'm confident that the God who's there
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.720]   does not want you to live that life.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.460]   And so you don't have to drive a certain car,
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.580]   you don't have to live in a certain house,
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.520]   there are things that God wants from you.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   And the question is, the way that you and I can have
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.040]   focus from distraction is by focusing
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.160]   not on all that needs to be done,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.400]   not on everything around me,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.320]   but what does Jesus want from me today?
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.280]   What does Jesus call me to today?
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.200]   It's not dissimilar to this, it's like,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.380]   my wife will at times send me and say,
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.720]   hey, will you go to the store and we need you
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.840]   to go get diapers and wipes or food or whatever it is.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.280]   And she'll give me a list of, hey, here's the things
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.320]   I gotta go, I'll go to Target, here I go, step in,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.160]   I'm looking around.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.400]   And if I was to take my list and I go to Target
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.380]   and all of a sudden, I'm just bombarded by like,
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.720]   oh, look at these, they've got, you know,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   a whole new Magnolia line and just these pants are on sale
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.960]   and those are pretty cool, Meroma, never heard of that.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   And I just begin to like, go through all the different store
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.920]   and I fill up my basket and I use my time
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.640]   not to get the things on the list,
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.880]   but things that I was like, I do need some more of that,
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.880]   I need some more socks, we need trash bags.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   And I fill up my basket with things that I think I need,
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.760]   but things that are not on the wants or on the list
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.900]   that my wife has given me, I've failed.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.000]   I missed out on the purpose, the reason why I'm at Target
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.200]   in the first place, in the same way,
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.040]   how many of us go through life and you will fulfill
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.080]   all kinds of different things, you've got an amazing car,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   you've got a great job, you may have a great relationship,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.000]   dating relationship, maybe you're listening online
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.160]   and you've got a sweet pad that you're living in right now
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.600]   and you are experiencing everything the world thinks
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.100]   you need and everything that maybe you're like,
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.800]   this is awesome, this is where life is found.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.600]   And you're not reading and doing the things in the list.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.880]   And you are failing and you are missing out
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.160]   on everything that God wants from you,
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.640]   you are missing out on the peace that comes
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.440]   when you would just simply say, I'm not gonna focus
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.800]   on what everything else needs to be done,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.320]   I'm just gonna focus, Jesus, what do you want me to do?
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.640]   I promise, if you will begin to ask that question,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.000]   focus your attention on that, you will experience peace.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.580]   I didn't get everything there was to get done,
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.100]   my car registration is still in need of being changed,
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.960]   but I was faithful today, in this conversation,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.800]   in this moment.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.120]   One of the things that's gonna drain and suck the life
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.000]   out of you is a constant distraction
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.040]   from the things that matter most.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.640]   And you will max out your life, but you will also miss out
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.600]   in life on the things that matter most.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.400]   Francis Chan, who's gonna be joining us at Awaken,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.980]   and is a good friend if you've been hanging around
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.040]   for the poor, or has been with us before, said this,
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.800]   our greatest fear should not be the failure
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.700]   of succeeding at things, our greatest fear should not
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.740]   be failure, but of succeeding at things in life
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.600]   that really don't matter.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.760]   When I look around Dallas, the thing that I fear for most,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.180]   the thing that, candidly, I fear for most of my life,
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.220]   or at the top of my list of the things that I fear
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.220]   about most, is spending my life focused on things
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.980]   that don't matter.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.520]   Where I live, what house I drive, or what house I live in.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.720]   Martha, stop opening that phone, Martha.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.220]   The amount of money that I make, where my kids go to college
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.120]   and how many of us are gonna spend our life,
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.100]   and you're gonna be successful at everything
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.740]   except for what actually matters.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.000]   What a tragedy.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.580]   Am I saying that maybe some of you should change jobs?
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.420]   Yes.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.620]   Am I saying that some of you need to get off dating apps
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.540]   because that's all you think about?
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.380]   Yes.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.260]   Am I saying that some of you may need to stop
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.340]   your side hustle, your Etsy business, your side job,
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.180]   whatever it is, yes.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.820]   If it is costing you on the things that matter most,
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.720]   so that you can focus your attention,
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.200]   and not get the most done, but focus on the things
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.000]   that matter most.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.660]   The second principle that really we see from Martha,
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.380]   who is being drained, it says, 'cause she was distracted,
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.120]   pulled in all these different directions,
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.140]   is that she was anxious and overwhelmed.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.960]   It says this, Jesus said in verse 41,
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.840]   "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.940]   "about many things."
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.100]   The same worried or upset, the same word there is troubled.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.700]   The second way that really, like Martha, we can be drained
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.020]   is by being drained from distress,
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.220]   from carrying stresses and burdens
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.180]   that you were never meant to carry.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.720]   All of us came into this room tonight
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.220]   carrying stress, things that are weighing you down.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.340]   And the God who's there is saying,
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.380]   those things are gonna drain, just like an app,
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.900]   certain apps are gonna drain your battery
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.380]   more than other ones.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.360]   Carrying those things is something
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.540]   you were never meant to carry,
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.740]   and they will drain the life out of you.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.900]   And the God who's there doesn't want you to experience that.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.740]   They will drain you to a point where it just feels like,
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.900]   I have no joy, I'm depressed, I don't even like where I am,
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.200]   I don't like who I am as a person.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.700]   And the God who's there is inviting you,
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.260]   man, you're not meant to carry those things.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.620]   For her, she was drained by all the stress
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.880]   of just stuff to get done.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.340]   For us, I think it looks like getting anxious
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.940]   and distressed by a few things.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.360]   Here's the three that I think of.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.380]   One is comparison.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.740]   Have you ever had that moment where you can feel anxiety
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.340]   over what you don't have but others do have,
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.700]   and you didn't even know that they had it
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.820]   until like five minutes, or until just like five seconds ago?
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.260]   You're like, oh, I pulled up on Instagram,
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.340]   they have this new car, I need a new car right now.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.180]   And all of a sudden, I'm distressed and I'm anxious
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.740]   over the fact that they have this car,
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.780]   or they're always on vacation,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.420]   I feel like I need a vacation.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.340]   And I can, through comparison, about what others have,
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.000]   about what I don't, about how much he's making
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.640]   and where I should be in life right now,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.780]   about how they have children and I should have those,
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.780]   or they're married already and I wish that I was,
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.500]   or they're in a dating relationship and I wish that I was,
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.100]   by comparison, all of a sudden, you can experience stress.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.140]   The other way that we can experience,
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.940]   or you can be drained and take on burdens
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.980]   you weren't meant to carry is through sin.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.820]   A lot of the most stressful situations
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.820]   that are weighing many of us down inside of the room
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.980]   is just related to sin.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.960]   It's a stressful thing to hide pornography.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.060]   It's a stressful thing to have an addiction,
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.960]   'cause you gotta feed that constantly.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.580]   It's a stressful thing to have an STD.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.380]   It's a stressful thing to live in a relationship
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.460]   or to be living with someone
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.020]   and you know they're not who God has for you.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.700]   That is a stressful thing, and it kinda gnaws at you.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:01.660]   And you're carrying a burden you were never meant to carry.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.100]   And the third, really, arena of the burdens
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.980]   that we can feel in this life is just circumstances.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.880]   And this is one that, if it's not affecting you right now,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.300]   it's gonna affect all of us at some point,
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.560]   as long as, or if you live long enough.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.340]   And that's just the fact of living in a broken world.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.740]   Somebody's gonna get cancer.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.560]   Somebody's marriages oftentimes don't always go,
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.960]   parents' marriages don't go the way
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.080]   that we hoped that they would.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.040]   The company has a layoff and you lose your job,
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.680]   and you can feel burdened from carrying on
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.260]   just the circumstances and the stress
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.600]   that comes from living in a broken world.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.440]   Here's the good news.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.080]   Whatever burdens that you are carrying,
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.720]   they all have the same solution.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.600]   Surrender those burdens to Jesus, to God.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.600]   First Peter chapter five, verse eight says,
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.020]   "Cast all of your anxieties on him
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.080]   "because he cares for you."
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.120]   Cast all of your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.440]   I mean, how chill could Martha have been
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.680]   had she gone to Jesus and been like,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.960]   "Hey, look, I'm a little worried about the food scenario.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.500]   "You guys just showed up.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.660]   "I don't wanna be that person,
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.200]   "but I got nothing in the pantry.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.380]   "But I do know that, like, a week ago,
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.560]   "you took bread and fish and you fed 15,000 people,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.700]   "so I'm pretty sure you can handle it."
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.480]   How different would her emotional experience have been,
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.780]   saying, like, "I'm not gonna carry this weight.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.100]   "Jesus doesn't want me to carry this.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.160]   "I'm just gonna bring it to him.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.360]   "That's what he wants."
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.200]   Would've been a totally different story.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.040]   Jesus doesn't need her to make him food
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.680]   any more than he needs you to reach that coworker.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.300]   But Jesus says, "Man, will you cast all of your cares,
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.620]   "bring everything that's burdened."
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.760]   That's what I love the verse.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.280]   It doesn't say, "Hey, cast all of your big worries on me.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.560]   "Cast everything that's really big in your life on me."
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.940]   It says, "Cast all of the things that you care about
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.880]   "because I care about 'em, 'cause I care about you."
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.220]   Think about that.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.120]   If you're inside of this room, you're like,
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.220]   "Man, I'm just worried.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.440]   "I'm not sure that I'm gonna be able to,
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.160]   "I need to switch from an Android to an iPhone."
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.760]   God's like, "Hey, I care about that, 'cause you care about it.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.440]   "I care about you."
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.480]   "Hey, I'm worried about, man, my dog is sick."
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.320]   Fill in the blank.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.020]   Things that we don't even think, God, that he's up there,
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.460]   he's like holding the whole world together,
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.280]   and there's still starving children in Africa.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.240]   I'm sure he doesn't care about that.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.440]   He cares about it 'cause he cares about you.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.280]   That's what the verse just said.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.680]   Cast everything that you feel anxious about,
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.520]   bring it to God.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.500]   Everything that weighs you down, pray to God.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.120]   Everything that you're holding onto is a burden
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.360]   you were not meant to hold onto,
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.880]   and he says, "Will you bring those things to me?"
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.360]   The solution to every burden,
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.640]   all the things that are gonna drain you and weigh you down,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.520]   is by surrendering those to him,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.860]   bringing those to him through prayer,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.200]   surrendering those to him.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.120]   You know who the least stressful
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.220]   or stressed person in my life is?
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.860]   My three-year-old son.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.740]   He's not worried about anything.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.980]   We have to force him to take a nap.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.640]   It's like, man, you don't know
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.160]   how much you're gonna want this someday, buddy.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.280]   This is really unfortunate.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.160]   I mean, he wakes up, he knows, like,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.320]   hey, I'm gonna get provided for.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.120]   They got apple juice in there, some applesauce.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.960]   I mean, we're just, our cup overflows here.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.480]   We got anything you need.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.880]   The only thing he ever worries about is like,
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.600]   am I gonna get chocolate or not today?
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.020]   That's it.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.800]   Last night, we went to the store to get M&Ms
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.760]   'cause we're out of M&Ms, and even then, it was like,
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.360]   all right, let's go to the store, get some M&Ms.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.200]   Why is he not stressed about anything?
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.720]   He's not walking around being like,
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.680]   are we sure we're getting the best deal
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.640]   on this electric bill that we have over here?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.040]   Do we know that, you know, TXU Energy,
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   is that really best for us, or should we switch to Verizon?
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.320]   Is there something we should be doing different?
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.560]   How are we gonna pay for college, Dad?
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.280]   I've been really thinking about my portfolio.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.780]   He's not stressed about any of that stuff.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.880]   He's just like, man, my parents provide.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.800]   Why does he think that way?
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.440]   'Cause he's around us all the time,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.640]   and he sees that anytime he has a need,
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.400]   not necessarily a want, anytime there's a need
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.000]   that his parents provide for him.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.800]   The Bible over and over and over again says
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.840]   that God wants you to see him as a heavenly father,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.480]   that he wants you to come to him.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.560]   He promises, I will provide for all of your needs,
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.880]   not necessarily all of your wants,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.400]   but even bring all those anxieties,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.720]   all the things that are weighing you down,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.560]   and I want you to see me like a toddler sees his father.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.880]   I'm a provider for you.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.000]   I'm crazy about you.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Cast everything that you care about.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Don't hold onto it.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.600]   Give it to me.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.560]   Bring it to me.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.760]   It's too heavy for you to hold,
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.920]   and it will drain you as long as you're holding onto it.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.960]   And the God who's there has cast everything
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.280]   that's weighing you down on me.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.720]   I'm strong enough to hold it.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.800]   The final solution that we see inside of the text,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.560]   or the final thing that is not a drain,
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.600]   but it's really the positive example that we see from Mary,
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.880]   is that it is a devotion to Christ that brings life.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.680]   And this feels like such a church Christian answer,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.760]   like, yeah, of course, he's gonna say,
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.240]   devotion to Christ is what brings life.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.080]   I get it, okay.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.600]   Whatever you are facing right now,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.720]   he don't wanna allow you to walk through
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.920]   the valley of the shadow of cancer,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.280]   the valley of the shadow of job loss,
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.440]   the valley of the shadow of breakup.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.960]   Whatever you're walking through will be a devotion to Jesus,
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.840]   that of everything in my life, he is my fixed focus,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.040]   my first importance.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.600]   I am committed to walking daily
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.840]   in a relationship with him like Mary.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.160]   Look at the language that he's using.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.920]   Look at the language that he's using, Mary.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.960]   Look at the language Jesus says.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.560]   Mary has chosen the better portion,
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.040]   the word better portion,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.720]   it was essentially a food analogy.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.960]   She has chosen the filet mignon,
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.680]   and I'm not taking it away from her.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.760]   She has chosen the better thing.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.240]   What is the better portion?
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.800]   Being with Jesus, knowing Jesus,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.440]   sitting and learning from him,
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.200]   walking in a relationship with him.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.640]   You wanna know what will allow you to sustain,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.120]   to endure, to face whatever is ahead for you,
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.160]   and to walk in a relationship with him?
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.920]   It will be you walking in devotion to Christ.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.560]   This is the only thing that continually gives life
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.320]   in a world that is broken,
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.560]   in a world that is fighting for your attention
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.960]   and fighting to drain you.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.760]   As every day, so you've got it.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.320]   First and foremost, you are my commitment,
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.480]   I am devoted to you,
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.560]   and I'm gonna walk in relationship with you.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:07.280]   Think about what Martha missed out on
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.640]   when she was devoted first to Jesus,
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.360]   but devoted to her task list.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.320]   Think about it.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.400]   She has the son of God in her living room.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.240]   Is there a more important person on the planet
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.000]   then and now?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.480]   Is there a more important person in all of human history
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.600]   that has come over to her house?
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.760]   Think about the limited number of people
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.240]   who ever even met Jesus.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.600]   How small was the number of people
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.560]   who had Jesus in their house?
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.440]   And what did Martha do?
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.280]   Did she spend time with him?
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.120]   No, she's like in the kitchen trying to sweep things up.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:32.960]   Think about that.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.240]   Think about what you're missing out on.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.640]   You're afraid of missing out
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.240]   on all the different things that you need to get done.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.120]   Martha, and the reality is you are missing out
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.880]   on the thing that is most important in life.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   So many of you are afraid.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.320]   That's what drives us to fill our life
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.600]   with so many things that we need to get done
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.040]   and so many distractions all the time
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.360]   is you are afraid of missing out
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.560]   and you are missing out on the thing
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.880]   that matters most in life.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.040]   And the choice like Martha had is yours.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.240]   Am I gonna be devoted first to Jesus?
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.400]   Or am I gonna choose to miss out?
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.040]   I mean, think of, I don't know who your like favorite,
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.120]   most famous person you're like.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.840]   If I could have anyone over to my house, it would be them.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.680]   That would be amazing.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa,
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.960]   Martin Luther, Moses, Cardi B.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.160]   You do you, fill in the blank.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.000]   Who would you be like?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.320]   That'd be awesome if they came over to my house
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   and got to hang out with them.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.160]   Think about it.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.980]   That person comes over to your house
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.120]   and you spend the whole time upstairs vacuuming and cleaning.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.480]   That's what Martha's doing.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.240]   That in her drive to get things done,
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.800]   she missed out on the Son of God and being in His presence.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.200]   And she was devoted more to a task list
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.440]   than devoted to Jesus,
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.680]   devoted more to the things that she wanted to get done
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.520]   than to Him.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:46.560]   In the same way, what is gonna fight for you
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.000]   every single day is for you to focus
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.080]   on things that are fleeting,
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.040]   on things that are meaningless,
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.880]   and you are gonna sacrifice your 20s.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.480]   Some of you listening right now,
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.720]   some of you in this room right now,
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.520]   are you gonna give your 20s to things that are pointless,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.720]   things that are meaningless,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.240]   things that you won't even remember,
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.640]   not in 15 years, next week.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.920]   Think about the last week that you had.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.760]   Think about last week.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.320]   Think about all the stuff that you got done.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.280]   You can't even remember most of it.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.860]   You're like, what did I do last week?
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.680]   It's hard to remember yesterday,
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.760]   especially when all of life is jam-packed
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.760]   with stuff that at the end of the day
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.160]   just really doesn't matter.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.120]   And I have the choice, am I gonna fill my life
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.760]   with the things that have eternal significance
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.040]   or am I gonna give my 20s,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   which is one of the most significant decades that you have.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.160]   Every major revolution in world history
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.120]   had at its epicenter the young adult,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.000]   had people like you with passion and energy
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.060]   and youth on their side.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.720]   There is no limit to what God can use you to do,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.560]   and are you gonna decide,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.080]   hey, I'm gonna give myself to the purpose I was created for,
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.740]   am I gonna give myself to just pursuing pleasure?
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.160]   And I'm gonna go to the bar scene and then the club scene,
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.800]   and you are wasting your 20s.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.240]   And you may think, like, this is so fun.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.920]   Think about how dull and monotonous the life that you live is.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.720]   That's one of the things we talk about all the time.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.640]   Sin robs you of creativity.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.840]   You're not out living an adventurous life.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.260]   You do the same thing every week.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.100]   What are we gonna do?
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.520]   It's Thursday, we're gonna go to happy hour,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.160]   and then we're gonna go to this next bar,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.000]   we're gonna get buzzed.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.920]   Hopefully we'll be not so drunk
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.200]   that I can't wake up Friday morning
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.480]   and be able to put it together at work.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.360]   Then Friday night, I'm a weekend warrior,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.160]   so I'm gonna, again, go out to the bar,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.280]   I'm gonna get, I'm hoping I'm gonna find somebody
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.080]   I can hook up and go with home
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.120]   or bring them home to my house.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.280]   And you're gonna do the same thing Saturday,
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.640]   and you hit repeat, you hit repeat, you hit repeat,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.120]   and you are wasting your life.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:35.960]   I wanna say that again.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.280]   You're wasting your life, and you're missing out.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.360]   You're missing out on the things
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.640]   that breathe peace into you.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.200]   You're missing out on the purpose you were created for.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   Let me say it like this.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.040]   This is a,
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.540]   this is a glove,
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.480]   in case you're not familiar with it.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.280]   What is this glove made for?
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.960]   It's made to go in your hand.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.200]   And it's made for cleaning, too, fair, touche.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.880]   But it's made, like any glove,
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.920]   it's made to go inside of your hand.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.160]   In other words, it's not made to go in your head,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.120]   it's not made to go on your feet,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.560]   not made to go on your toes,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.680]   not made to, you know, just sit by itself.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.880]   It's made for the purpose.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.800]   Like, what was it created for?
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.640]   It was made to go in your hand.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.040]   Well, how do you know?
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.940]   It's made in the image of a hand.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.560]   This thing only fulfills its purpose
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.720]   when it's connected to the thing
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.280]   that it's made in the image of.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.360]   When it's not connected to the thing
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.160]   that it's made in the image of,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.080]   it fails to fulfill its purpose,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.440]   it is empty, it is hollow.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.200]   It may look pretty on the outside,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.400]   it may be something that someone goes,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.560]   oh, I know what that's for,
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.720]   but it is failing to fulfill its purpose.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.200]   So are so many of you.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.640]   Because unless you are connected
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.240]   to the thing that you are made in the image of,
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.360]   which is God, just like this thing,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.640]   is made in the image of a hand,
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.520]   that's how you know what it is for,
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.840]   what it is to fulfill, what its purpose is.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.040]   So many of you are failing to live out
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.880]   and experience your purpose
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.320]   because you are failing to connect
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.840]   and be connected to the thing that gives you purpose,
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   the thing whose image you were made in.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.820]   And you have a choice.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.840]   How are you gonna spend your 20s?
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.760]   How are you gonna spend your life?
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.720]   Are you gonna wake up tomorrow
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.280]   and just focus on the American dream
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.920]   and the Dallas message of, like,
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.000]   get more money wherever you live?
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.880]   Move on to the next relationship,
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.760]   try to find your value
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.160]   and how many likes you get on a post
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.560]   or what a guy says about you,
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.640]   what some girl says about you,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.560]   or what amount you have in your bank account,
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.120]   or you can experience your purpose,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.880]   but there's only one way to get it,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.600]   and that is to walk in connection
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.680]   with the one whose image you were made in.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.320]   Mary knew that lesson.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.400]   Hopefully Martha learned it that day.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.080]   And the tragedy, and man, it, like, breaks my heart,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.200]   is so many of you, you're gonna give your life
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   to chasing more money for the rest of your life,
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.320]   and hopefully I'll get some kids on a white picket fence,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.520]   and someday I'll be able to retire.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.680]   Someday I'll be able to, you know,
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.320]   kick back and relax a little bit.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.600]   How crazy is that?
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.900]   And you're gonna give the best years
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.640]   or some of the best years that you have
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.800]   to chasing what everyone else in the world around you
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.960]   says you should chase after,
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.400]   and not what Jesus says is where life is found,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.240]   what ultimately matters.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.140]   What a waste.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.100]   But it doesn't have to be.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.920]   In conclusion, the things that are gonna drain
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.320]   and suck the life out of you
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.340]   are being distracted by everything except for what matters,
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.840]   being distressed and carrying burdens
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.680]   that God who's crazy about you doesn't want you to carry,
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.320]   and thinks he's gonna breathe life into you
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.520]   is being devoted first and foremost to him.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.520]   I'm gonna walk in relationship with him.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.040]   If you have a phone, you can take it out
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.440]   and you can turn it back on.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.480]   You know what you're gonna see when you turn it back on?
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.940]   Whatever amount of battery life you had in there,
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.400]   you still have.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.360]   If you had 50%, you got 50%.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.560]   It didn't drain anymore.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.320]   But you know what it didn't do?
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.480]   It also didn't charge up to 100%.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.680]   Whatever you had is where you're still gonna have.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.760]   The only way for it to charge up fully
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.040]   is for it to be connected to a source of energy,
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.760]   of power, for you to plug it in.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:20.200]   Every second that it is away from that source of power,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.040]   in other words, every second that it's not connected,
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.640]   plugged into the wall to a phone charger,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.340]   it's gonna just continue to drain.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.780]   This is how the Christian life is lived.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.240]   That you, unlike a phone,
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.760]   are not meant to be charged once at night
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.440]   and then go the rest of the day disconnected
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.440]   from this source of energy which is Christ.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.020]   You are meant to be constantly connected.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.440]   And every second and every moment
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   that you're not living in dependence on him,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.800]   you will be drained and you will be draining.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.040]   Every second that I'm not walking in dependence
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.440]   and continuing just Christ,
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.280]   will you help me to be aware of you
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.440]   in the midst of my circumstances?
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.640]   Will you help me to have peace right now
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.560]   no matter what I'm facing around me?
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.920]   Will you give me courage to face
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.020]   and share my faith with this friend?
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.400]   Will you help me to see just your,
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.240]   see the way that you see people?
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.640]   It is when I live in a constant state of dependence
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.920]   and walking with him that I experience
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.160]   not being drained but being filled with life.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.240]   This is what this whole story is about.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.080]   I mean, let me say it again.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.240]   It's the same way that a phone needs to be connected
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.160]   or else it will constantly drain.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.480]   As a follower of Jesus, you need to be connected with him
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.720]   moment by moment, walking in relationship with him
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.760]   or you will be drained
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.460]   which is the point of this whole story.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.520]   Think about it.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.680]   The point of the story is not like
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.100]   Jesus is against go-getters.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.140]   That's not what he says at all.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.100]   The point is that he wants a relationship with you
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.280]   above everything else.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.760]   He wants you to know him and him to know you
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.440]   beyond you serving him and doing things for him.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.280]   He wants a relationship, a constant connection with him.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.240]   He's not against go-getters.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.040]   Look at the Apostle Paul.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.640]   He's the greatest go-getter the world has ever seen.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.200]   He's against you serving him and not knowing him.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.240]   He's for you, walking in connection
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.500]   and relationship with him.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.360]   And what will sustain and allow you
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.880]   no matter what you face to not be drained
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.040]   but be sustained is that, is walking in dependence on him.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:17.880]   Let me pray.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:37.140]   Father, would you help us to be still?
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:42.000]   At a heart level, would we be still
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.500]   and know and be convinced that you are God?
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.680]   You will be exalted among the nations.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.360]   You are at work in the midst of whatever we're facing.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.520]   You are sovereign over our lives.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.920]   We can walk in dependence on you
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.640]   and you've invited us into a relationship.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.920]   You've invited us to cast everything that's weighing us down.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.360]   Every fear, every hope, everything,
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.960]   you've invited us to cast onto you.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.400]   And so I pray for friends in the room right now
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.960]   that are walking through painful circumstances
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.920]   in their own life and just surrounded by it
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.100]   that they would cast everything on you
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.460]   and you would sustain them.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.680]   Father, would you help us to be devoted
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.580]   first and foremost to you, not distracted
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.140]   from the things that pull our attention
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.420]   in a world that is constantly bombarding us
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.180]   with everything except what actually matters?
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.260]   Would you unleash from this room
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.740]   the greatest missionaries for your namesake
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.740]   that have ever existed?
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.620]   The greatest days of the church would be in front of us
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.420]   because of the men and women inside of this room
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.980]   who go on to do greater things
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.500]   than the church has ever seen before
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.040]   for your name and your sake, God.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.560]   And would you save us from living a life
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.040]   that is devoted and successful even
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.960]   at everything except for what actually matters in life?
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.600]   Will you protect me, God?
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.960]   Because my spirit is willing and flesh is pulled
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.400]   at the distractions of the world around us.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.100]   And so would you help those who are weak like me
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.400]   and all of us in this room
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.480]   to be devoted first and foremost to you,
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.320]   our Savior and our King, amen.
