1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 - The book of James is made up of 108 verses.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 54 of them are imperatives.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,500
 An imperative is a command.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,240
 (dramatic music)

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:24,120
 That Jesus was not just his half-brother, he was his Lord.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,360
 - All right, well, hey, welcome friends in the room,

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,760
 friends in Houston, Texas, El Paso, Indianapolis,

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,400
 Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Iowa, Boise, Idaho,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,120
 all the 15 different Ports of Live locations

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,380
 and everybody tuning in online.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,200
 We are continuing this series on the book of James.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,760
 Let me read the passage that we're gonna be in tonight

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,160
 and then I will launch into it

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,520
 and give us some tracks for where we're gonna be.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
 This is James chapter two, starting verse 14.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,240
 "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,520
 "if someone claims to have faith

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,340
 "but has no deeds or actions?

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,040
 "Can such faith save them?

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,300
 "Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,140
 "and daily food and one of you says to them,

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,840
 "go in peace, keep warm and well-fed,

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,120
 "but does nothing about their physical needs,

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
 "what good is that?

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,480
 "In the same way, faith by itself,

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,920
 "if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,460
 "But someone will say, you have faith, I have deeds.

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,020
 "Show me your faith without deeds

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,460
 "and I will show you my faith by my deeds and my actions.

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,460
 "You believe that there is one God, good.

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,060
 "Even the demons believe that and shudder.

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,960
 "You foolish person, do you want evidence

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,000
 "that faith without action is useless?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
 "Was not our father Abraham considered righteous

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,320
 "for what he did?

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,120
 "When he offered his son Isaac on the altar,

37
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,160
 "you see that his faith and his actions

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,860
 "were working together.

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,160
 "His faith was made complete by what he did.

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,480
 "And the scripture was fulfilled that says,

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,540
 "Abraham believed God and it was credited to him

42
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,440
 "as righteousness.

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,540
 "He was called God's friend.

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,140
 "You see that a person is considered righteous

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,140
 "or right with God by what they do and not by faith alone.

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,840
 "In the same way, was not even Rahab

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,060
 "the prostitute considered righteous

48
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,020
 "for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,120
 "and sent them off in a different direction?

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,540
 "As the body without the spirit is dead,

51
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,100
 "so faith without deeds is dead."

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,400
 Let me pray one more time.

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,900
 Father, thank you for your word.

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,420
 Thank you that you're half-brother James,

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,180
 who lived with you, who knew you,

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,380
 who grew up in the same house with you,

57
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,100
 who came to faith and believed

58
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,780
 that you were not just his brother,

59
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,640
 but you were the savior of the world.

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,540
 That you inspired him to write

61
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,100
 and instruct and give teachings to us.

62
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,260
 And so I pray tonight that the incredible truths

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,820
 of what it looks like and how we can know

64
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,980
 that we have an actual real faith

65
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,100
 were preserved and given to us.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
 So I pray that you would use this time,

67
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,420
 you would speak through us.

68
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,360
 I pray for everyone represented at the thousands of stories

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
 because there's thousands of people in this room

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,620
 and are listening all over the country right now

71
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,500
 in different locations,

72
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,160
 whose names I don't know, but you do.

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,640
 Who the number of hairs on their heads, you know.

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
 You know everything, every anxiety they feel,

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,240
 every hope they have for their future,

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,200
 every pressure that's weighing them down,

77
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,360
 every sorrow that's weighing their heart,

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,720
 that they would encounter and meet you.

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,180
 And they would see that you're not a God who is distant,

80
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,440
 who's apathetic, but one who loves and runs after

81
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,980
 and cares and wants you, all of his children

82
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,960
 to experience life.

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,300
 And so would that be believed, understood

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,140
 and received tonight, in Christ's name, amen.

85
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,540
 Well, if you've been coming for any length of time,

86
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,220
 I, from time to time, will share about a hobby

87
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,420
 that I have on the side that is called flipping golf carts.

88
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,660
 What's flipping golf carts?

89
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,820
 It's not where you go up to a golf cart

90
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,740
 and you try to flip it on its side

91
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,060
 like cow tipping or something.

92
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,280
 It's where you buy a cheap golf cart off of some resale,

93
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,500
 you know, Facebook marketplace or Craigslist

94
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,100
 or OfferUp or any of that stuff.

95
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,920
 And I'll try to buy it and then flip it

96
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,420
 and at least not lose cash

97
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,740
 because it's one of the best hobbies, especially with kids.

98
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,260
 'Cause in the meantime, you're fixing it up

99
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,620
 and trying to trick this thing out

100
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,900
 and you get to go cruise the neighborhood

101
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,860
 with kids every night.

102
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,500
 So this is, you know, this is what you do.

103
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,900
 This is what you have to look forward to,

104
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,380
 the exciting life ahead.

105
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,020
 But this will happen.

106
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,700
 And one of these happened last late November,

107
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,620
 early December, where I was like,

108
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,320
 man, we should go look for another golf cart,

109
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,560
 find one, found a good deal.

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,920
 Kind of always have a pulse on that.

111
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
 It's a weird thing, but it's true.

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
 And found a good deal, went and bought it.

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,160
 Was so excited.

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,520
 We're gonna go look at Christmas lights.

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,480
 Lights will be out, kids in the car,

116
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,740
 just, you know, on top of the world kind of feeling.

117
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,940
 Go buy the golf cart.

118
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,200
 Everything checks out.

119
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,120
 Get back home, load everyone up.

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
 Who's excited?

121
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,600
 We're gonna go see Christmas lights.

122
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,880
 And it was like one of those, just the top of the mountain.

123
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,320
 This is just the best hot cocoa,

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,800
 four year old and a two year old at that time

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,620
 sitting with me, mom,

126
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,960
 just cruising around the neighborhood,

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,660
 looking at Christmas lights, Christmas cheer.

128
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,080
 About a mile into,

129
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,720
 and less than that, maybe three, four, seven mile

130
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,680
 away from our house, we're riding,

131
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,280
 and the thing completely shuts down.

132
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,120
 There's no go.

133
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,160
 I'm pushing the pedal.

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
 There's no gas.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
 They're electric, so they'd run off of batteries.

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,560
 And I realized, man, this thing is not going anywhere.

137
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,760
 And it goes in a moment from like the best of times,

138
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,720
 ha ha, this is amazing, isn't this so great?

139
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,520
 Take a picture, to, oh my gosh,

140
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
 we're gonna die out here

141
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,680
 where I'm having to push this thing

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,360
 with three people on it, a mile all the way home,

143
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,640
 going up hills, the lights on it don't work anymore

144
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,920
 'cause it's not getting power.

145
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,860
 And it went from the best of times to the worst of times

146
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,040
 where you're just trying to hold it together and stay sane.

147
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,640
 And I'm pushing this thing home.

148
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,920
 And it was not a holly jolly Christmas evening,

149
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
 just to say that.

150
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,800
 So we go home, I get there and I begin to look at like,

151
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,640
 man, what just happened?

152
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,920
 Did I just get totally scammed out of this golf cart?

153
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,240
 I'm looking in and they're pretty simple machines.

154
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,400
 It's going somewhere by the way.

155
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,600
 They run off of six different batteries.

156
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
 So I check the batteries, I pull them out.

157
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,240
 I assume one of them is dead.

158
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,200
 Take these volt meters,

159
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,440
 basically checks the positive negative side,

160
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,100
 go through, check all the different batteries.

161
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,140
 This one checks out, this one checks out,

162
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,120
 this one checks out, boom, dead battery.

163
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,600
 A golf cart can't run with a dead battery

164
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,160
 because it'll short out the circuit essentially.

165
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,480
 And what had happened was one of those batteries,

166
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,760
 lo and behold, I was unaware, purchased it,

167
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,120
 and it was totally dead.

168
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,080
 What does that have to do with James chapter two?

169
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,120
 Well, tonight, in the same way that I took a volt meter

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,440
 and I was able to test and see which of these is dead

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,760
 and a dead battery, the passage we're gonna look at

172
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,360
 is James's volt meter as it relates to faith.

173
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
 Well, he's gonna go through and he's gonna say,

174
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,520
 hey, here's how you can know you have a living,

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,600
 saving, real faith.

176
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,960
 And here's how you can know you have a dead faith.

177
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,460
 And he's gonna put a volt meter up to our faith,

178
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,900
 our beliefs.

179
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,880
 Inside of the room, a lot of us would claim

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,360
 and say we're Christians.

181
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,680
 And James would say, if you claim to be a Christian,

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,440
 and yet if the volt meter of God's word

183
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,800
 that we're gonna explore comes up to your life,

184
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,400
 it's not necessarily what you say that matters,

185
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,680
 it's whether or not you actually have a real faith.

186
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,960
 I'm gonna explain even what I mean by that

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,440
 and what I mean by faith, but James is gonna say,

188
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,340
 there's a way that you can leave here tonight

189
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,440
 knowing 100% confident,

190
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,960
 I have a real, genuine, authentic faith.

191
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,020
 And there's a person who will leave here tonight

192
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,840
 and they should wrestle with the fact

193
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,120
 that according to James, I'm not actually a Christian.

194
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,160
 I don't have a faith.

195
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,680
 I don't even actually believe the things

196
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,240
 that James would say mean I'm a Christian.

197
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,200
 I don't know that there is a more important passage

198
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,900
 in the book of James that we're gonna study.

199
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,460
 It's a passage that quite literally,

200
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,000
 James would say, depending on which camp you fall into,

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,780
 a dead faith or living faith,

202
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,400
 answers the question of where you will spend

203
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,760
 your eternity someday.

204
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,620
 I know in the room there's also people

205
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,240
 who may just kind of exploring the faith

206
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,360
 and this is just for you to know,

207
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,800
 this is a message towards Christians.

208
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,380
 James is gonna say, one of the reasons

209
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,600
 that if you are exploring faith,

210
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,560
 you wouldn't even say you're a Christian,

211
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,880
 one of the reasons a lot of times people don't like

212
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,600
 the church or Christians is because people

213
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,080
 will claim to be Christians or have a real faith.

214
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
 And James would say, they've got a dead faith.

215
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,480
 They don't live their lives like Jesus calls them to

216
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,940
 or like a person with a genuine real faith would.

217
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,300
 And so you may have written off Christianity

218
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,260
 and you weren't writing off actual Christianity,

219
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,980
 you were writing off a poser.

220
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,780
 So tonight we're gonna explore some of the most

221
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,060
 packed and punching verses that James has.

222
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,660
 It also is one of the most misunderstood passages.

223
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,860
 So we're gonna go slow, address kind of the challenges

224
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,760
 that's out of the text and explore exactly

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,780
 what James is saying.

226
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,900
 If you're just joining us tonight,

227
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,620
 we've been going through the book of James.

228
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,180
 James, as I said earlier,

229
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,960
 was written by the half brother of Jesus.

230
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,380
 You may not know this, Jesus had siblings.

231
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,880
 They didn't have the same dad 'cause his dad was God,

232
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,300
 but they grew up in the same home.

233
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,600
 And James was one of them.

234
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,000
 He didn't always believe.

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
 In fact, for years, he thought his brother was crazy

236
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,860
 and starting some cult.

237
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,120
 And then his brother died and he came back alive.

238
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,460
 And James spent the rest of his life going everywhere

239
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,820
 saying, I saw my brother die, buried in the ground.

240
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,340
 And then he came back to life.

241
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,560
 He's the savior and he gave his life to it.

242
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,400
 And he wrote the earliest book of the New Testament.

243
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,220
 In other words, you do a trivia game after this,

244
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,060
 a torch is not, you're like,

245
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,160
 "Hey, what's the earliest book of the New Testament?"

246
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,300
 The book of James.

247
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,040
 He was the head of the church in Jerusalem,

248
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,720
 one of the key leaders that God used

249
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,800
 to see Christianity explode all over the world.

250
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
 And he writes this letter and in it,

251
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,720
 he's writing to people and he says,

252
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,120
 "Here's how you can know you have real faith.

253
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,840
 And let me tell you my biggest burden.

254
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,360
 Some of you right now, listening online,

255
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,040
 listening on the podcast, Future Day,

256
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,100
 listening at locations, you don't have a real faith.

257
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,440
 And the best thing that you can do is acknowledge that

258
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,500
 so that you can change that.

259
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,760
 Because you grew up in a Christian home,

260
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,100
 you went to Catholic school, you went through confirmation,

261
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,260
 you were an acolyte,

262
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,680
 but you've never actually had a true conversion,

263
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,080
 had a moment where you actually surrendered

264
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,560
 your life to Jesus.

265
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,920
 And tonight, James would say, "This is your night.

266
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,580
 And the best thing you can do is stop faking it,

267
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,240
 hiding it, pretending it, and make the decision.

268
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,720
 I'm gonna actually evaluate, do I have a genuine faith?"

269
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,360
 So we're gonna look through the passage again.

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
 We're gonna look at three things.

271
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,460
 What James says is worthless faith,

272
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,320
 what he says is authentic faith,

273
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
 and then what are the actions of authentic faith?

274
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
 So you can know like, "Oh man, man, that's me.

275
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,960
 I do have a real faith."

276
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,600
 Or you can know, "That's me, I don't have a real faith."

277
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,980
 So James chapter two, verse 14, I'm gonna read it again.

278
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,780
 We'll go slow through the text.

279
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,120
 Where he brings up the topic of worthless or dead faith.

280
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,720
 Here's what he says.

281
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,600
 "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,

282
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,160
 if someone claims to have faith,

283
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,640
 but they have no actions that flow out of that faith?

284
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,480
 Can such faith save them?"

285
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,700
 In other words, hey, if somebody has faith,

286
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,320
 but it doesn't impact their life,

287
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,920
 is that actually a saving faith?

288
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,520
 Like, do they have genuine, real faith in God?

289
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,340
 Suppose, and then he uses an illustration.

290
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,700
 "A brother or sister is without clothes and daily foods."

291
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,660
 They're shivering, they're cold, and they're hungry,

292
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,780
 James says, "Imagine with me."

293
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,260
 And one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm,

294
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,100
 be blessed, stay well fed."

295
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,460
 But does nothing about their physical needs.

296
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,700
 What good is it?

297
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,720
 His point is, if somebody's starving, sitting there,

298
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,740
 they're freezing to death, and you just tell them,

299
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,740
 "Hey, be warm, God bless, brother."

300
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,160
 It does nothing to impact their life.

301
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,880
 He's using that as an illustration.

302
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,600
 In the same way, faith by itself,

303
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,160
 if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

304
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,640
 The first idea from the text is that workless faith

305
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,440
 is worthless faith.

306
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,200
 And I'm gonna go real slow around the turns,

307
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,680
 'cause it's really important to understand

308
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,800
 what James is saying, what he's not saying.

309
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
 But he says, "Hey, workless, actionless,

310
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,280
 a faith that doesn't produce, doesn't change,

311
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,440
 doesn't impact how you live, how you think,

312
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,600
 how you operate, is a worthless faith."

313
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,240
 Or he uses another analogy of, "It is a dead faith

314
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,600
 if it doesn't have works."

315
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,220
 Now, let me address really quickly

316
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,360
 the interpretive challenge.

317
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,280
 What's an interpretive challenge?

318
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,360
 It's when you read the Bible and you're like,

319
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,400
 "Whoa, that seems a little interesting,"

320
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,000
 or, "That seems like it contradicts itself."

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,780
 All throughout the New Testament, there's verses,

322
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,320
 if you've been a Christian or around the Bible for some time,

323
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,400
 you've heard verses that seem to contradict

324
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,660
 what he just said, 'cause he just said,

325
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,120
 "Hey, you think you have faith, but you don't have works,

326
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,280
 you don't have actions, you're not really saved."

327
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,240
 James, that feels harsh, bro.

328
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,160
 Doesn't the Bible say you're saved by grace through faith,

329
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,240
 not by works?

330
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,080
 Yes, it does.

331
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,760
 Ephesians chapter two, verse seven through 10 says,

332
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,920
 "It is by grace," grace is giving a free gift,

333
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,460
 a gift that you don't deserve.

334
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,480
 "It is by receiving an undeserved gift

335
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,840
 that you can be saved through faith,

336
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,240
 or believing in Christ and what he did on the cross,

337
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,560
 rising again."

338
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,300
 It's not of yourselves, it's the gift of God's,

339
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,220
 not by works, so that no one can boast.

340
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,960
 For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus,

341
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,000
 to do good works, which God prepared in advance

342
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
 for us to do.

343
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,080
 Is James and Paul contradicting each other?

344
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,920
 No.

345
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,400
 James is not saying that works are a requirement

346
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,900
 to be a Christian or to be saved.

347
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,120
 James is saying that good works are a by-product

348
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,380
 of being saved.

349
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,180
 In other words, it's not what gets you

350
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,480
 into a relationship with God,

351
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,300
 it's what happens to people

352
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,120
 who get into relationship with God.

353
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,700
 It naturally begins to flow out of them.

354
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,400
 Even Paul's verse in Ephesians chapter two says,

355
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,120
 "Hey, you've been saved by grace through faith,

356
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,180
 nothing you've done, not because of anything you did."

357
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,520
 And then he goes immediately into,

358
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,140
 "You are God's handiwork or masterpiece,

359
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,180
 created for good works."

360
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,960
 You get saved and it leads to life change.

361
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,380
 As it's been well said throughout just church history,

362
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,380
 safe, I'm sorry, faith that saves is never alone.

363
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,800
 We're saved by faith alone, but a faith that saves,

364
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,160
 true faith, is never alone.

365
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,120
 We are saved by believing in Jesus

366
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,120
 and what he did on the cross, by faith alone.

367
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,800
 But once that happens, that faith or a saving faith

368
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,160
 never stands alone.

369
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,940
 It begins to impact and change lives.

370
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,280
 And James is saying, "Hey, if you have workless,

371
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,680
 actionless faith, you don't have real faith.

372
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,640
 You have a worthless faith.

373
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,680
 If it doesn't lead and change the way that you date,

374
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,760
 the way that you spend money, the way you use your time,

375
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,960
 you should be concerned."

376
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,840
 It's not dissimilar to this.

377
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,840
 If it's not working or if there's no active impact

378
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,880
 on how you live your life,

379
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
 you probably don't have a real true living faith.

380
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,720
 You have a dead faith.

381
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,820
 My home, I love security cameras.

382
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,660
 Here's why.

383
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,300
 Really big left turn here.

384
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,140
 So one of my favorite things about living in 2021

385
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,580
 is that security cameras, you know, 15 years ago,

386
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,580
 only like Bill Gates had security cameras.

387
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,940
 Now you can go on Amazon for like 25 bucks,

388
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,740
 your whole home, you can put them everywhere.

389
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,780
 They're wired and it just allows

390
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,760
 probably the neurotic part of my brain

391
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,300
 to be able to go like, "Oh, what's going on at home

392
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,120
 when I'm traveling or doing something on the road?"

393
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,540
 So we've got them all over the place.

394
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,100
 And recently I was like,

395
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,500
 "Man, I should put some in the backyard."

396
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,900
 Or like, I can't believe I'm that guy.

397
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
 I just put them in the backyard

398
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,260
 and maybe in the neighbor's yard too.

399
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,460
 And I was like, "Man, I'm gonna buy outdoor camera.

400
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,740
 It's got a two year battery on it and just put it there.

401
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,820
 And I'll be able to see anybody that comes over there

402
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,660
 or jumps in the fence

403
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,940
 and you are not messing with my lady at home or my kids."

404
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,300
 So that's my mindset.

405
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,260
 I go buy the camera and I get it at home.

406
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
 I'm setting it all up, go to put it up.

407
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,700
 And I set it and sync it with an app

408
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,580
 that you have on your phone

409
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,780
 that allows you to kind of see what's taking place.

410
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,080
 And I realized, "Man, this thing is not working."

411
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,740
 And so I try to turn it off, turn it back on,

412
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
 sync it back again.

413
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,700
 There's nothing taking place in this security camera.

414
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,880
 In other words, this thing that I bought

415
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,740
 that I thought would work and allow me to see

416
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,600
 and be able to patrol and know what is going on

417
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,700
 has no life in it.

418
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,020
 I can't see any signs of anything on there.

419
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,220
 And I'm looking through the manual,

420
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,240
 Googling how to fix this thing.

421
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,260
 And it was a dead, entirely dead camera.

422
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,700
 It wasn't a camera at all.

423
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,560
 An expensive bunch of plastic.

424
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,060
 Because a camera that can't take footage

425
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,220
 and doesn't have video and can't look and see and use

426
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,420
 is worthless.

427
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,540
 And James would say,

428
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,760
 "If you don't have a faith that impacts how you live,

429
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,380
 "you have a worthless faith."

430
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,740
 That any faith that doesn't have works

431
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,740
 or that doesn't lead you to change

432
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,740
 or doesn't guide your life is a worthless, worthless faith.

433
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,140
 How else do you know if you have a dead faith?

434
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,480
 Well, what are things that are not dead do?

435
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,320
 They grow.

436
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,980
 Some of you guys, if you live in a house,

437
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,100
 you went through snowmageddon.

438
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,820
 I guess we all did if you live in Dallas.

439
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,140
 And at snowmageddon, something happened

440
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,540
 if you have a house or you live in a place

441
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,500
 where there's plants and different things outside.

442
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,400
 For whatever reason, I have never known

443
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,620
 that whenever a huge storm comes in,

444
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,460
 you're supposed to go out

445
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,380
 and put like blankets on the plants.

446
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,300
 This is so weird to me.

447
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,400
 People are like covering them up,

448
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,380
 like, "All right, good night, honey."

449
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,220
 Okay.

450
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,180
 And you're supposed to do this.

451
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,980
 And I don't ever know which ones to put it on

452
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,420
 because you don't have like 85 different blankets

453
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,560
 for all these different bushes.

454
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,060
 And so is it like eenie, meenie, minie, moe

455
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,260
 or which one is gonna most likely die?

456
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,600
 And so we just don't do that.

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,860
 And we just rolled the dice.

458
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,380
 We rolled the dice at the end of snowmageddon

459
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,500
 and became very clear.

460
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,200
 Snowmageddon, for those in other locations, was in Dallas.

461
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,600
 It was a month ago and just snow, ice, craziness.

462
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,440
 It was very clear.

463
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
 It became very clear afterwards

464
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,700
 which things were living and which were dead

465
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,200
 because spring came right behind that.

466
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,740
 And the things that were living

467
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,820
 all had one thing in common.

468
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,380
 They grew.

469
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,020
 They began to produce leaves and grow.

470
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,620
 And the things that were dead did not.

471
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,180
 They still are not

472
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,900
 'cause they're sitting there and they're dead.

473
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,600
 If you have a genuine living faith,

474
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,860
 it is going to grow.

475
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,660
 And a question you should be asking,

476
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,740
 if you trusted in Christ,

477
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,180
 maybe at like age seven at Iwanas

478
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,700
 or you were raised in Catholic school

479
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,780
 and you went through confirmation,

480
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,100
 do you have a faith that when you look back,

481
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,020
 you see, "I have grown.

482
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,980
 "I am more spiritually mature today

483
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,980
 "than I was last year, three years ago, four years ago."

484
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,720
 Because James would say,

485
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,300
 "If you don't, you have a dead faith."

486
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,280
 Living things grow.

487
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,120
 When you look back in your life,

488
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
 can you see a trajectory where things began to change?

489
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
 There's a lot of people in this room,

490
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
 when it comes to faith,

491
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,540
 you're right in line with what James says.

492
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,300
 And again, I'm talking to people

493
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,620
 who would say I'm a Christian.

494
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,780
 If you're here and you're exploring,

495
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,420
 man, you just get to look on and be like,

496
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,820
 "I can't believe you guys."

497
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,940
 These are people that would claim to be a Christian.

498
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,820
 And they have what James says.

499
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,980
 A lot of times people who claim to be Christians,

500
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,380
 but aren't Christians do, they got lip service.

501
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,580
 Real true faith is not lip service.

502
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,980
 It is a lifestyle.

503
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,780
 It impacts how you live.

504
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,020
 The guy said, you can say a bunch of words.

505
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,280
 I mean, the analogy he gives is

506
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
 the guy who is not genuine in his faith says,

507
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,280
 "Oh, stay warm, stay well fed, God be with you."

508
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,420
 That he has lip service,

509
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,220
 he just doesn't have a lifestyle that goes along with it.

510
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,340
 And if you don't have a lifestyle

511
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,060
 that goes along with your faith,

512
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,300
 and it's just, man, I am a Christian, I claim to be that.

513
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,060
 Yeah, I'm cool with God.

514
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,200
 You don't have a real faith.

515
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,660
 This is so huge in dating.

516
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,460
 Let me just say this really quick.

517
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
 There are people in this room, guys and girls,

518
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,780
 who would claim to be a Christian.

519
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,780
 They got a Bible, they go to the porch,

520
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,360
 they got Jeremiah 29 11 in their Instagram bio right now.

521
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,800
 And they are not Christians, biblically.

522
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,160
 Because if you ask them and you explain like,

523
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,080
 hey, what's the gospel?

524
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,200
 Or what does it mean to be a Christian?

525
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
 They'd be like, well, I try to be a good person.

526
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
 And I try to live my life in a good way.

527
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,480
 And I go to church and pay my taxes.

528
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,560
 That's not what it means to be a Christian.

529
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,580
 It's not somebody who was raised in Catholic school

530
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,400
 and they went through mass or went through confirmation

531
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,480
 and they were all in and it was important.

532
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,600
 It's someone who has a moment in time

533
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,500
 where they believe Jesus is the son of God.

534
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,860
 And not just that he's the son of God,

535
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,420
 but he came and he died on a cross for them.

536
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,820
 For every sin, every abortion represented here,

537
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,420
 every look of pornography represented here,

538
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,440
 of all the sexual sin represented here,

539
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,940
 all of it on the cross nailed.

540
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,780
 He died, he paid for it and he rose again.

541
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,620
 And anyone who says,

542
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,020
 I accept Jesus paid for my sin on the cross

543
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,100
 and he rose from the death or rose from dead

544
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,040
 to prove that payment was more than enough.

545
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,880
 And I believe it.

546
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,920
 And I'll have eternity with God, not 'cause I deserve it,

547
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
 but because he paid for it.

548
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,080
 That person is a Christian.

549
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,280
 Someone who says, man, you know, I'm cool with God

550
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,160
 and I like church.

551
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,400
 Even if they say they are,

552
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,280
 you can say you're a Christian, that doesn't mean you are.

553
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,320
 I can say I'm a hippo.

554
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,680
 It doesn't mean I'm a hippo.

555
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,460
 And James says, it's not lip service.

556
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,240
 It is a lifestyle.

557
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,520
 The gap between someone,

558
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
 and we'll move off the dating thing,

559
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,580
 but the gap between someone who is a porch attendee

560
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,580
 or a church attendee and a Christ follower is enormous.

561
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,260
 And you need to make sure

562
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,580
 that when it comes to who you're evaluating,

563
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,860
 who you're considering dating,

564
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,740
 you are not dating just somebody who is attending the porch

565
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,380
 or attending church, but someone who is following Christ.

566
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,080
 'Cause that is a chasm or a grand canyon

567
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,300
 in between the two of them.

568
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
 And right in the middle, what's in that gap?

569
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,460
 Obedience to Jesus.

570
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,160
 They don't just put lip service out,

571
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,240
 it impacts their life and how they live.

572
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,760
 I know in this room, I mean, we live in Dallas,

573
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,660
 we live in the Bible Belt.

574
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,760
 You ask the average person, hey, what's your faith?

575
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,680
 They're gonna say I'm a Christian.

576
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,240
 And by that, they mean I'm not an atheist,

577
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,860
 I'm not a Hindu, and you know, as raised,

578
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,520
 we went to Easter and Christmas together growing up.

579
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,920
 And they're not a Christian.

580
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,760
 This past weekend, we went with my wife's family,

581
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,160
 we went to a lake house up in Oklahoma.

582
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,060
 And while we were there,

583
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,920
 they had this extra large checkers board.

584
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,800
 And I sat down, my five year old was like,

585
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,640
 oh, I wanna play checkers, I've never played checkers before.

586
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,540
 And I sat down and I'm looking at this extra large

587
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,720
 kind of checkers board.

588
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,140
 And I was like, oh man, I loved checkers as a kid,

589
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,360
 played it all the time.

590
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,520
 And I began to realize,

591
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,640
 I can't remember how to play checkers.

592
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,760
 I know it's a very simple game

593
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,800
 where you kind of hop over different things,

594
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,480
 but can you go forward and back?

595
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,520
 No, you can't go, or is it diagonal?

596
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,640
 Are we both on the same like checkers?

597
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,500
 Or what, and I had to look up the rules

598
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,580
 because it's been years.

599
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,980
 I can remember how to play chess,

600
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,060
 I can't remember how to play checkers.

601
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,120
 It's something that was so a part of my childhood,

602
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,420
 but at some point you kind of walk away from that

603
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,640
 and it's no longer a part of your active life

604
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,700
 or part of your life.

605
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,620
 That is what so many people's faith is like.

606
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,700
 It's a thing that like, oh yeah,

607
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,000
 and I totally remember it and Jesus,

608
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,500
 and there was Jonah and there was a whale

609
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,340
 and there was God and there's some cool stuff in there.

610
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,240
 And you know, he died for us.

611
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,180
 And I went to church and I was raised around it and VBS.

612
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,960
 But it's just something from your past.

613
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,120
 It's not a part of your active present.

614
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,240
 And James would say, man, God's not angry at you.

615
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,620
 He loves you, he loves you so much.

616
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,080
 He has you here on a Tuesday night to know

617
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,360
 that if it's not a part of your lifestyle,

618
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,020
 it's not an active living real faith.

619
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,340
 He continues.

620
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And he goes into how you and I can see

621
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,720
 what authentic faith looks like.

622
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,360
 But someone will say, so he brings up

623
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,400
 in theoretical hypothetical person,

624
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,420
 you have faith, I have deeds,

625
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,540
 as though you could separate those.

626
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,600
 Show me your faith without deeds

627
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,000
 and I will show you my faith by my deeds.

628
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,940
 You believe that there is one God, good.

629
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,360
 Even the demons believe that and they are not saved.

630
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,920
 They shudder.

631
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,700
 James says, hey, the way that you can see,

632
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,380
 show me your faith without deeds is like saying,

633
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,680
 show me how fast you are without running.

634
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,360
 Show me how strong you are without lifting a weight.

635
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,680
 Show me how intelligent you are without taking a test.

636
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,920
 It's not possible to do.

637
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,080
 That these two things are interrelated.

638
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,700
 That a person who has genuine faith,

639
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,720
 I believe 'cause the word faith means trust.

640
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,600
 A person who genuinely trusts God

641
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,160
 has that play out in their life and impact how they live,

642
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,920
 how they spend their time, who they are.

643
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,620
 He says, there is a belief and how terrifying is this?

644
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,860
 There is a belief that doesn't save you.

645
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:06,200
 It makes you in the same grouping as the demons themselves.

646
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,180
 It's not a saving belief 'cause it doesn't lead

647
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,000
 to a changing and impacting.

648
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,120
 It's a belief in or a belief about,

649
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,880
 but not an actually believe and a trust.

650
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,880
 He brings up demons, which is quite the left turn.

651
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,560
 But when you think about it, he's saying,

652
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,620
 hey, the demonic realm, demons that are out there,

653
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,780
 they believe about God.

654
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,720
 They have a better theology probably than every person,

655
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,760
 including myself on the stage up here.

656
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,120
 Over and over, if you read the New Testament,

657
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,180
 you read the gospels, which is the stories of Jesus' life,

658
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,380
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

659
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,680
 Jesus will walk around and he'll interact with them people

660
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,920
 and he'll show up inside of a village

661
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,040
 and somebody who will be demon possessed will pop out

662
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,780
 and be like, say things that are staggering.

663
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,120
 They know very well who Jesus is.

664
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,560
 They know better than the disciples.

665
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,680
 The 12 guys fall on him like, oh, we're not exactly sure.

666
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,560
 And the demons will pop out and they'll say,

667
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,760
 we know who you are, the Holy One of God.

668
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,360
 Have you come to destroy us?

669
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,400
 Here's one example, Mark 1:23,

670
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,440
 an impure spirit, Jesus walking through town,

671
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,040
 pops out and said, what do you want with us,

672
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,920
 Jesus of Nazareth?

673
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,440
 Have you come to destroy us?

674
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,800
 I know who you are, the Holy One of God.

675
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,400
 They know exactly who he is and they're not saved.

676
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,720
 They shudder in fear at him.

677
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,220
 And James says, a belief about God,

678
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,720
 a belief in God is different than believing God.

679
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,960
 Let me explain, 'cause that's a really,

680
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,040
 really important adjective

681
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,000
 or really, really important preposition.

682
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,080
 Believing in is different than I believe you.

683
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,900
 Someone could say, oh yeah, I believe in God.

684
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,320
 Like, I believe in higher power.

685
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
 I believe in, you know, old man upstairs.

686
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,040
 I believe in God up there of some sort.

687
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,100
 That is different than I believe God is who he says he is.

688
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,720
 And I believe him when he says, you should date this way

689
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,160
 and save sex for marriage.

690
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,640
 I actually take him at that word and I trust him.

691
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,180
 I'm actually gonna act in light of that.

692
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,480
 I believe that when he says, hey,

693
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,640
 you're not just here to get a paycheck

694
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,480
 and live your whole life,

695
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,200
 storing up as much cash as you can

696
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,800
 and living as though you're gonna live forever

697
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,460
 in this world, you're to live and take all the resources,

698
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,840
 all the money, all the opportunities,

699
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,860
 all the time that you got and use them

700
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,380
 as though you're gonna spend forever in eternity with God.

701
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,600
 And anything you give towards his kingdom,

702
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,040
 you're gonna have a hundredfold given back to you

703
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,220
 in the life to come, which will be far longer than this one.

704
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,880
 He says that type of person,

705
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,100
 the person who doesn't believe in,

706
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,740
 like, oh, I think they exist up there,

707
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,740
 but I believe him is a saving faith.

708
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,180
 Demons, they believe in, they know he's there.

709
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,120
 They're terrified of him.

710
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,620
 They know he's powerful.

711
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,960
 They believe about him.

712
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,420
 They don't know him.

713
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,840
 And he would say, the way that you can know that

714
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,700
 is that authentic faith is an acting faith.

715
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,860
 It doesn't just believe about, it believes and acts.

716
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,860
 A behavior follows from that belief about God.

717
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,500
 Another way of saying it is,

718
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,940
 you can believe God is real,

719
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,860
 or you can believe God is Lord.

720
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,300
 The person who believes that God is real

721
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,620
 is somebody who would say,

722
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,340
 oh, I think there's a higher power,

723
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,520
 but that's different than somebody who says,

724
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,500
 God, you're my Lord.

725
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 When you say, "Goes," I'm gonna live my life for you.

726
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,260
 You're my Lord, you're my Savior.

727
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,780
 When you say, "I'm gonna seek to obey,"

728
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,620
 the person who says that God is real,

729
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,220
 they attend church, they show up at the porch sometimes,

730
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,660
 they go to church on Christmas and Easter,

731
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,000
 'cause it's just what you do.

732
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,720
 The person who believes God is Lord,

733
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,000
 not just God is there, they get plugged in,

734
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,060
 they dive in and do what Hebrews 10, 24 says,

735
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,900
 which is that you and I are to continue to gather

736
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,820
 in small groups and encourage one another

737
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,060
 and have these deep, real, authentic relationships

738
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,100
 with other Christians who come alongside

739
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,900
 and they encourage me when I'm struggling,

740
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,700
 and I encourage them when I'm struggling,

741
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,220
 and we both read the Bible together

742
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,620
 and we walk alongside of each other,

743
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,320
 that person believes he's Lord, not real.

744
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,980
 The person who believes he's real is like,

745
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,180
 yeah, dude, sex before marriage,

746
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,840
 you know, I'm not just throwing myself out

747
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,380
 like I'm a crazy prostitute, but we love each other

748
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,700
 and we're probably married in God's eyes and His ways,

749
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,780
 and we're gonna get married someday,

750
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,060
 and so it's not that big of a deal.

751
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,420
 If that person believes God's real,

752
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,380
 but he's not their Lord,

753
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,500
 the person who believes he's Lord says,

754
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,340
 yeah, of course I'd love to sleep with my boyfriend,

755
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,220
 of course I'd love to sleep with my girlfriend,

756
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,140
 but according to the Bible,

757
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,100
 sex is something that God gave us this incredible gift

758
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,340
 that takes place in the context of marriage,

759
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,460
 and so even though I don't feel like it,

760
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,620
 even though I don't want to,

761
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,900
 even though I'd love to sleep with her,

762
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,460
 that's not what we're gonna do.

763
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:34,580
 And there's a huge difference, James would say,

764
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,540
 to the person who believes in God and believes God.

765
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,500
 I read, I can't believe I'm using this illustration,

766
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,460
 but it was a fun book.

767
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,700
 I read, it was a book Matthew McConaughey wrote,

768
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,860
 and I can't remember the name of it.

769
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,300
 Oh, Greenlights or something?

770
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,700
 Greenlights?

771
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,060
 So I was all, hey, stop judging me, people.

772
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,780
 Good grief, I'm not endorsing it either.

773
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,400
 I'm not, I know a guy who read this book

774
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,540
 by Matthew McConaughey, and I'm praying for him,

775
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,380
 and we were on vacation, people.

776
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,880
 I just wanted a fun, anyways, read the book,

777
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,260
 and in there, it's like basically his autobiography,

778
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,700
 and he goes through kind of his journey in life,

779
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,340
 and it's not at all a spiritually deep book

780
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,100
 or even something I'm recommending,

781
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,820
 but point being, I got to walk through it,

782
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,300
 and like, oh, this is where his parents were,

783
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,540
 this is where he was raised, this is where he lived,

784
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,380
 he grew up, he went to school,

785
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,340
 this is kind of what he was like.

786
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,500
 Here's how he even got into that,

787
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,140
 like, all right, all right, all right moment.

788
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,400
 Here's all of Matthew's story.

789
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,080
 Now, if I ran into you in a lobby,

790
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
 and I began telling you, and you didn't know

791
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,240
 that I'd read the book, but you just knew,

792
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,720
 I just got in a conversation, I was like,

793
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,600
 oh man, have I told you about my friend Matthew?

794
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,440
 And he is from East Texas, great guy,

795
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,840
 Matthew McConaughey, probably heard of him.

796
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,240
 He lives in Austin now, real big UT fan,

797
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,720
 which I've got mixed feelings about,

798
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,040
 and he, and I walked through, and I just was like,

799
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,280
 oh, and he's so great, and his kids,

800
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,440
 have you seen his, I love, his kids, they're the best.

801
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
 I love being around his kids.

802
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,340
 And you said, do you know Matthew?

803
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,300
 And I was like, yeah, of course I know,

804
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,140
 and then I'm like, how do you know Matthew?

805
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,900
 I was like, well, I read his book.

806
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
 (congregation laughing)

807
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,900
 You'd say, you are like borderline stalkerish right now.

808
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,260
 You don't know Matthew, you know about Matthew.

809
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,620
 There's a difference between knowing someone

810
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,780
 and knowing about them.

811
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,980
 A lot of us, when it comes to God,

812
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,420
 you know about him, you don't know him.

813
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,620
 And you could say some things,

814
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,340
 and you've got different nuggets

815
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,380
 you've picked up along the way,

816
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,080
 but you don't actually have a relationship with him

817
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,560
 any more than I have one with Matthew McConaughey.

818
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,120
 And James would say, God, isn't that angry?

819
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,080
 And you could change that.

820
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,480
 In fact, God wants you to change that.

821
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,440
 He wants a relationship with you.

822
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,620
 He wants you to experience that,

823
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,560
 and that involves you trusting in Christ

824
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,880
 and not believing in God, but believing God

825
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,400
 and walking with him and acting out

826
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,840
 according to your faith that you claim to have.

827
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,040
 And then he finishes and he gives us

828
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,440
 the actions of authentic faith.

829
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,640
 So he walks through and he covers

830
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,980
 how you and I can know what it looks like

831
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,240
 to have authentic faith, which is that it always acts.

832
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,600
 And then he finally gives the actions

833
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
 that authentic faith has.

834
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,600
 So how you can know right now,

835
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,120
 do you actually have authentic faith?

836
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,720
 And he gives two illustrations from the Old Testament.

837
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,900
 One is patriarch, which is just like a father Abraham,

838
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,020
 and then one is a prostitute.

839
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,920
 Quite the gap, but he's going somewhere

840
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,160
 and he proves this point by saying,

841
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,000
 hey, look at the actions that they had,

842
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,620
 this real faith that was associated.

843
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,160
 You foolish person, do you want evidence

844
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,200
 that faith without action or deeds is useless?

845
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,200
 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous

846
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,200
 for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

847
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,640
 You see that his faith and his actions were working together,

848
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,180
 doing what true faith always does,

849
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,080
 which is they work together in tandem.

850
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,860
 And his faith was made complete by what he did.

851
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,720
 And the scripture was fulfilled that says,

852
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,860
 Abraham believed God, not believed in God,

853
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,600
 he believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.

854
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,400
 And he was called God's friend.

855
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,520
 He did what friends do, good friends anyways,

856
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,340
 and that they're willing to act out of that friendship.

857
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,640
 They're willing to come pick you up,

858
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,000
 they respond when you need a ride to the airport,

859
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,540
 when you're moving somewhere, they act on that.

860
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,780
 And he did what real friends

861
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,820
 or what a friend of God would do,

862
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,500
 which is he acted in light with his belief.

863
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,460
 You see that a person is considered righteous

864
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,460
 by what they do and not by faith alone.

865
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,000
 The same you may have justified or counted as righteous.

866
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,260
 He's saying you can see a person has genuine faith,

867
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,820
 not just by what they claim, but why, by how they act.

868
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,200
 That's what he says.

869
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,120
 In the same way was not even Rahab,

870
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,780
 the prostitute considered righteous for what she did

871
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,480
 when she gave lodging to the spies

872
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,540
 and sent them off in a different direction.

873
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,120
 As the body without the spirit is dead,

874
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,080
 so faith without deeds is dead.

875
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,240
 He goes into two illustrations.

876
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,520
 First one, Father Abraham, what's he talking about?

877
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,960
 Father Abraham was the guy God comes to,

878
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,480
 Genesis chapter 15, Genesis, first book of the Bible,

879
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,020
 all the beginnings of how this whole thing started.

880
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,880
 God shows up to a guy named Abraham,

881
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,400
 Abe is sitting there, God says,

882
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,040
 "Hey, I'm gonna make you a father of many nations.

883
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,380
 "Look up at the sky, see all the stars that are out there,

884
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,580
 "as many stars as you could see out there beyond that,

885
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,840
 "so shall your descendants be."

886
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,480
 And he looks up, sky's full of them,

887
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
 not like Dallas stars,

888
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,980
 but like out East Texas country stars everywhere.

889
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,120
 That's how many kids you're gonna have.

890
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,020
 Abraham goes 75 years, God shows up again and says,

891
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,060
 "Hey, I'm gonna make you a father of many nations.

892
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,600
 "You're gonna have kids after kids."

893
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,660
 He's like, "Hey, that's great God, problem is I'm 75,

894
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,640
 "my wife is 65, not sure any babies coming out of that,

895
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,240
 "and I don't know what you're planning on doing,

896
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,440
 "'cause I'm not gonna have any kids

897
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,080
 "and I'm gonna die without any kids, you promised."

898
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,960
 God's like, "Got you, it's gonna happen."

899
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,240
 20 years go by, God shows up again,

900
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,640
 says, "Hey, this time next year, you're gonna have a kid."

901
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,480
 By this time, he's 199 years old,

902
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,480
 and it says his body is as good as dead.

903
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,640
 And his wife is 90,

904
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,520
 I don't know if you've seen any 90 year olds recently,

905
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,100
 but not exactly the typical prenatal group

906
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,120
 that you're gonna see at the hospital.

907
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,380
 But God shows up, he has a child, Isaac.

908
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,940
 We waited a century for a baby boy.

909
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,860
 How spoiled was that kid?

910
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,900
 We waited a century for you.

911
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,000
 Loves him, cares for him, God's promise came through.

912
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,780
 Then one day God shows up and he says,

913
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,560
 "Abraham, yeah, I want you to do something for me.

914
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,740
 "I want you to take your son, your one and only son,

915
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,960
 "whom you love, and I want you to take him

916
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,280
 "to the place I will show you.

917
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,080
 "And I want you to sacrifice him there on an altar to me.

918
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,920
 "I want you to put him to death."

919
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,960
 I mean, how staggering is that if you're Abraham?

920
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,880
 Like, this is the child we've been waiting,

921
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,480
 this is the one that you promised, it was through him.

922
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,680
 And you didn't say any child, you said through this child,

923
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,880
 you're gonna bless all of the world,

924
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,400
 the Savior will come through this one child.

925
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,480
 How can you be asking me to do that?

926
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,720
 And it says that Abraham believed that

927
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,780
 if God even had to raise him back from the dead, he would.

928
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,880
 And he trusted God with his most prized possession.

929
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,060
 And he takes his son, his son's a young boy,

930
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,180
 doesn't know what's going on.

931
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,900
 Says, "Isaac, we're gonna go worship the Lord.

932
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,560
 "I need you to carry this wood."

933
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,740
 And he has his son carry the wood for his own death,

934
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,660
 all of which foreshadowing Jesus,

935
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,560
 who unlike Isaac, who would not be killed,

936
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,320
 was killed, the son of the father,

937
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,920
 who carried his own cross like Isaac carried the wood.

938
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,520
 But Isaac's walking along with his dad, walking out there,

939
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,880
 and they get to this place called Mount Moriah.

940
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,560
 And they have this servant with him,

941
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,720
 and Abraham says, "Hey, so you stay here,

942
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,920
 "me and Isaac are gonna go up the mountain,

943
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,360
 "and we will both come back."

944
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,660
 But he knew no matter what happened, God had promised,

945
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,860
 I don't know what's about to go down,

946
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,700
 but even if my son's life is taken,

947
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,380
 he will be brought back to life.

948
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,820
 And they're walking up and Isaac says,

949
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,420
 "Dad, you know, we've worshiped tons of times,

950
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,120
 "we've done this, but we got wood,

951
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,540
 "we don't have like a lamb or anything to kill."

952
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,900
 What was that moment like as a dad?

953
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,060
 And he takes his son, and they build an altar,

954
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,180
 and he lays him down,

955
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,320
 and he raises up and he's about to kill his son.

956
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,680
 And out of nowhere, God says, "Don't kill your son!"

957
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,000
 And he raises his eyes and he sees out in the thicket,

958
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,400
 there had been a ram that had been caught there.

959
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,640
 God provided a sacrifice.

960
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,760
 The reason he didn't have to kill his son

961
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,080
 is God knew he was about to,

962
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,240
 he would 2,000 years later kill his.

963
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 But Abraham believed and trusted God,

964
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
 and acted even on the most prized,

965
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,640
 precious possession that he had.

966
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,480
 I trust you.

967
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,840
 It led him to act, even when it cost him.

968
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,920
 Rahab, what happened to Rahab?

969
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,880
 Rahab was a prostitute, not exactly the dream job

970
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,680
 that every girl grows up wanting to have.

971
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,240
 She lived in the city of Jericho,

972
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,820
 also not exactly the dream city or place

973
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,000
 to live in that time.

974
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,360
 Pagan city, nation of Israel, free from Egypt, shows up.

975
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,560
 God says, "Hey, you're gonna go in,

976
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,360
 "and you're going to take the promised land."

977
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,720
 Says that to the nation of Israel,

978
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,560
 Moses, Joshua, all these guys, if you remember.

979
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,460
 Joshua goes and he's like,

980
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,440
 "Hey, we need to spout out the city of Jericho.

981
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,160
 "So two spies, you guys go in there."

982
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,500
 The two spies go inside,

983
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,240
 and they get into the city of Jericho.

984
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,200
 And the king of Jericho finds out two spies

985
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,480
 from that foreign group, the Israelites,

986
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,480
 who God had basically destroyed the Egyptians through.

987
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,560
 Two of the spies are here.

988
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,880
 They're probably gonna attack us.

989
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,760
 And he's told they went into Rahab's house.

990
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,240
 Now, a lot of people go into Rahab's house

991
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,040
 because Rahab was a prostitute.

992
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,760
 So king sends word and says, "Rahab,

993
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,640
 "hey, where are those two guys that showed up?

994
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,560
 "We know that they went in here."

995
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,760
 And she was like, "They were here,

996
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,000
 "but they left and they kind of went out,

997
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,860
 "and they're not here anymore."

998
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,540
 And she hid the two spies.

999
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,380
 She hid them on the roof.

1000
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,520
 And she goes up to the two spies after everyone leaves,

1001
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,800
 or after the king's men leave,

1002
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,760
 and she goes, "Hey, we know what you did.

1003
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,600
 "Word about what God has done for the nation of Israel

1004
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,740
 "has spread everywhere, and fear fills this city right now.

1005
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,360
 "We know God is gonna take it back.

1006
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,180
 "And I know that this land is your land,

1007
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,360
 "and God is going to give us into your hands.

1008
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,680
 "And I'm asking you one thing.

1009
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,960
 "I hid you, and I risked my own life.

1010
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,420
 "Will you repay that by whenever you attack the city,

1011
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,040
 "not killing me and my family?"

1012
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,060
 And they said, "A life for a life.

1013
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,920
 "Just put a red scarlet rope right outside of your window."

1014
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,440
 She puts it outside the window, and she risked her life

1015
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,840
 in order to save these two men,

1016
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,960
 even though it would have cost her,

1017
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,900
 even though it could have cost her her own life

1018
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,560
 if the king had found out she had hidden them.

1019
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,860
 Why does he bring in these two examples?

1020
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,320
 Because they both point to what authentic faith does.

1021
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,720
 The actions of authentic faith

1022
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,400
 is that it trusts God.

1023
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,400
 It acts out of a response to that faith,

1024
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,240
 even if it costs them, even when it's uncomfortable.

1025
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,960
 Here's how you can know if you have authentic faith,

1026
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,240
 if you have genuine, real faith,

1027
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,760
 is that it is willing to act even when it is uncomfortable,

1028
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,200
 when it costs you, when it costs you at work,

1029
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,960
 when it costs you in a dating relationship,

1030
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,280
 when it costs you financially,

1031
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,800
 when it costs you your reputation,

1032
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,880
 when it costs you, period, when it's uncomfortable, period.

1033
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,120
 When it comes at something that makes no sense

1034
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,960
 for you to act that way, for you to date that way,

1035
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,720
 for you to talk that way, for you to give that way,

1036
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,440
 for you to live that way, unless there's a God who's real,

1037
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,360
 and then it makes all the sense of the world.

1038
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,080
 The way that Abraham and Rahab displayed authentic faith

1039
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,840
 is even if it costs me my life and my son,

1040
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,400
 I believe you, God, I trust you, I'm gonna act.

1041
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,120
 And the way that you can personally know,

1042
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,260
 I'm not saying you personally have,

1043
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,700
 I'm saying you can personally know,

1044
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,640
 do I have authentic faith, is when you look at your life,

1045
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,920
 do you act in a way that you could go,

1046
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,240
 man, this comes at nothing but cost to me.

1047
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,560
 Dating the way that God's word says,

1048
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,240
 where I actually honor girls and I don't just ghost them,

1049
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,820
 I don't just peace out, and I actually am a kind person,

1050
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,400
 I try to leave them better than I found them,

1051
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,120
 I honor their purity and sexually,

1052
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,240
 and I'm considerate of that person,

1053
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,680
 that's not how any of the world dates,

1054
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,720
 that's not how anybody will tell you to date,

1055
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,020
 that's how God says to date.

1056
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,760
 That comes at all costs to you, unless the Bible is true,

1057
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,240
 and it actually is the better way to live,

1058
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,600
 and it actually is something that God sees

1059
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,600
 every action that you take and rewards it.

1060
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,560
 Then it makes all the sense of the world.

1061
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,840
 But you can know right now, hey, I act out of my faith,

1062
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,940
 even with it costs me.

1063
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,040
 I could do other things that are kind of shady at work

1064
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,640
 and everybody else in the business does them,

1065
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,040
 but I'm not gonna do those things because I believe God,

1066
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,640
 and I'm gonna walk in my integrity as the Proverbs say,

1067
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,600
 even if it costs me.

1068
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,800
 I'm gonna spend time every single day

1069
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
 studying God's word, waking up early,

1070
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,120
 even though the world around me is like, that is crazy,

1071
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,600
 and it is crazy if there is no God and the Bible's not true,

1072
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,360
 but if it is, it's the most rational,

1073
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,200
 sane thing in the world.

1074
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,100
 It's giving sacrificially.

1075
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,040
 I know you guys feel like nobody has any cash

1076
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,080
 in the world in here,

1077
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,600
 but it's taking whatever you have and saying,

1078
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,400
 God, everything I have is yours.

1079
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,440
 How would you have me use this in giving to churches,

1080
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,080
 giving to Christian ministries, giving to people in need

1081
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,840
 out of a response to your faith?

1082
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,780
 The authentic faith leads to actions.

1083
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,120
 What are those actions of authentic faith, the third idea?

1084
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,080
 It's that they choose to trust God and follow Him,

1085
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,240
 even when it costs Him.

1086
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,700
 That I'm gonna choose not to intellectually just say,

1087
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,780
 I know God, I'm gonna act on what God has said,

1088
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,200
 even if it costs me.

1089
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
 A lot of you in the room,

1090
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,800
 it's an old school illustration I heard when I was younger,

1091
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,160
 and it was about having a chair.

1092
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,720
 And it was basically pointing out that, man,

1093
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,580
 it's one thing to say, I believe that chair can hold me.

1094
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,360
 I believe if somebody sat in that chair,

1095
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
 I think they're gonna be okay.

1096
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,200
 It's made out of metal, what is this, Ikea?

1097
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,040
 What are we doing here?

1098
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,640
 And it's got solid plastic,

1099
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,080
 it looks like it probably could hold me.

1100
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,760
 And I believe that could hold you.

1101
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,280
 I believe that chair can hold somebody up there,

1102
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,840
 probably up to 300 pounds-ish, maybe a little shy of that,

1103
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,600
 but it's pretty sturdy looking, it could hold somebody.

1104
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,760
 And if somebody said, what do you sit in the chair?

1105
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,280
 I said, well, I don't have to sit in the chair,

1106
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,740
 I believe it, it can hold me.

1107
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,440
 Why don't you sit in the chair?

1108
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,860
 What are you, legalist?

1109
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,400
 I told you I believe that the chair can hold me up,

1110
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,440
 and that should be good enough for you to know.

1111
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,200
 It's a whole different thing to say, man,

1112
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,760
 I believe the chair can hold me,

1113
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,280
 and to actually be willing to say, man,

1114
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,480
 I'm gonna sit in the chair,

1115
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,060
 'cause I can trust it.

1116
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,560
 And true faith is one that says, man,

1117
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,920
 even if everybody else in the world is not willing

1118
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,680
 to act this way, or do what God says,

1119
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,280
 or it seems so old-fashioned, or nobody's doing it,

1120
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,200
 I actually believe it,

1121
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,100
 which means I'm actually acting on it.

1122
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:12,480
 And James says, that's 'cause you have real faith,

1123
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,260
 true faith, Abraham Rahab faith.

1124
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,260
 My son, I'm about to close.

1125
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,100
 When kids are young, you go swim in the pool,

1126
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,740
 and this year has been like the year of the hotel for us.

1127
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,300
 I feel like we've gone to more hotels,

1128
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,140
 and they're all like La Quinta, so that's how we ball.

1129
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,620
 And we'll be there, and we don't have a pool,

1130
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,100
 but they have pools, so we'll go down to the pool,

1131
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,060
 and I'll bring my kids, and every now and then,

1132
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,580
 they'll get too scared to jump off the side of the ledge,

1133
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,220
 and then sometimes, they just can't get enough of it,

1134
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,940
 and they wanna jump off the side of the ledge.

1135
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,820
 But I can tell whether or not they trust

1136
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,020
 when they're jumping off the side of the ledge

1137
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,060
 to me to catch them,

1138
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,340
 whether they believe, man, I got you, I'm gonna catch you,

1139
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,220
 I'm not gonna let you fall in, I got you.

1140
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,100
 And they'll sit there,

1141
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,060
 and especially my two-year-old daughter named Monroe,

1142
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,300
 who would stutter step, I'm like,

1143
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,180
 man, I think he'll got me, I'm not really sure,

1144
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,340
 and I feel like I've seen him drop some things before,

1145
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,940
 and she'll sit there, and I know when she trusts me,

1146
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,700
 because what does she do?

1147
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,540
 She jumps.

1148
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,220
 Until she does that,

1149
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,820
 she's not trusting her father will catch her,

1150
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,800
 or she's not trusting her father,

1151
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,500
 she's trusting her footing on the side of the pool.

1152
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,780
 The way you can see authentic faith is that it acts,

1153
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,300
 and the actions that it takes

1154
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,240
 is that it trusts the Heavenly Father.

1155
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,500
 When no one else, when the world around you thinks,

1156
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,720
 oh, that's crazy, nobody lives like that.

1157
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,740
 I live like that, 'cause God says to live like that,

1158
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,180
 and I believe that, and I get nothing in return,

1159
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,940
 you know what, God's not gonna love me any less

1160
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,480
 or love me anymore just because I date the way he says,

1161
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,320
 I live the way he says.

1162
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,340
 It's not why I live that way,

1163
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,320
 I live that way 'cause I believe God,

1164
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,360
 when he says, when you live according to my word,

1165
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,440
 the Bible, it leads to life,

1166
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,880
 and when you don't, it leads to pain, regret, shame,

1167
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,540
 heartache, and I believe him.

1168
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,880
 Even if nobody else is gonna sit in the chair,

1169
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,000
 I'm gonna sit in the chair,

1170
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,960
 and I'm gonna trust my father,

1171
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,940
 not my footing, not myself, not what I think.

1172
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,780
 Conclusion, workless faith is worthless faith.

1173
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,720
 Authentic faith always acts,

1174
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,540
 and the actions of authentic faith trust the Father,

1175
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,520
 even if it comes at great cost to him.

1176
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,500
 There's a story of a guy named Charles Blondin.

1177
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,260
 Charles Blondin was a tightrope walker in the 1800s.

1178
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,460
 He lived in France, and he was so successful

1179
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,100
 that eventually he was recruited to come to America.

1180
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,500
 In the 1800s, there was not a ton of entertainment,

1181
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,100
 so a huge crowd would show up

1182
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,540
 because there wasn't, at that time,

1183
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,300
 Mavs games and PS5,

1184
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,260
 there wasn't anything like that to entertain yourself,

1185
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,300
 so people would flock to come see this guy.

1186
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,020
 By the thousands, Charles Blondin,

1187
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,520
 known as the Great Blondin.

1188
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,800
 He had mastered tightrope walking so much

1189
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,960
 that he was able to walk across Niagara Falls,

1190
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,060
 which is 1,100 feet long, on a three-inch rope.

1191
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,520
 He could walk across in the 1800s.

1192
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,460
 He got so good at it that he was able

1193
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,400
 to not just walk across,

1194
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,760
 one point he walked in stilts,

1195
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,900
 one point he walked across blindfolded,

1196
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,480
 one point he got midway through the rope

1197
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,320
 that was going across,

1198
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,920
 and he sat down and he cooked an egg,

1199
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,920
 ate the egg, stood back up, walked back.

1200
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,680
 One day, he pulls out a wheelbarrow,

1201
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,400
 gets the wheelbarrow, takes his big sack of potatoes,

1202
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,880
 throws the sack of potatoes in the wheelbarrow.

1203
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,280
 Crowd's going nuts, and he's like,

1204
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,060
 you think I can walk across with a wheelbarrow?

1205
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,360
 Of course you can, you're the Great Blondin.

1206
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,760
 Crowd's going nuts, they got Blondin bobbleheads,

1207
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,660
 they're just going crazy over Blondin.

1208
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,200
 He walks across, wheelbarrow across,

1209
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,160
 goes halfway, comes back, crowd's going nuts.

1210
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,600
 Says, who thinks that I can walk across this tightrope

1211
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,680
 with a person in the wheelbarrow?

1212
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,720
 Crowd goes nuts.

1213
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,240
 Of course you can, you're the Great Blondin.

1214
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,400
 Calms him down.

1215
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,760
 Who's gonna get in the wheelbarrow?

1216
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,680
 (congregation laughing)

1217
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,680
 Silence.

1218
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,400
 Until one person comes forward,

1219
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,080
 gets in the wheelbarrow.

1220
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,200
 That person was his manager.

1221
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,280
 He'd gone everywhere with him,

1222
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,360
 he'd seen every time he'd done anything on a tightrope,

1223
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,720
 he'd seen all the different feats that he'd done,

1224
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,440
 and through that, his faith grew and grew and grew.

1225
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,240
 So when it came to Blondin, he believed.

1226
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,760
 Man, I don't just believe you could,

1227
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,760
 I believe it so much that I will.

1228
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,880
 It's a very sharp difference between the person

1229
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,800
 who steps out of that crowd and the crowd who says,

1230
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,680
 I believe, but not really.

1231
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,880
 How do you think he got that way?

1232
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,040
 Well, it's clear, he saw it.

1233
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,200
 Every single time that he saw the way that Blondin acted,

1234
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,120
 his faith, his confidence, and his ability to do,

1235
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,040
 to walk across a tightrope, even with a person,

1236
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,800
 even with hundreds of pounds of potatoes in there,

1237
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,960
 I believe you can do it,

1238
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,420
 and his confidence grew every single time.

1239
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,240
 When it comes to your faith, it's like a muscle

1240
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,680
 that God wants you to have the type of intimate relationship

1241
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,700
 where every time that you trust him, it's gonna grow.

1242
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,200
 You're gonna be like Blondin's manager,

1243
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,840
 where I have seen what you've done,

1244
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,600
 I've seen you show up in my life,

1245
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,720
 I've seen the way that when you say,

1246
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,080
 how I'm supposed to think about my job,

1247
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,200
 how I'm supposed to treat my parents,

1248
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,880
 how I'm supposed to handle conflict,

1249
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,200
 how I'm not supposed to gossip,

1250
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,640
 I've seen how it goes better,

1251
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,680
 how that's a better way to live, and I trust you.

1252
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,440
 And every time you decide to be obedient,

1253
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,260
 you know what happens?

1254
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,120
 Your faith grows.

1255
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,640
 It's like a muscle, it gets stronger.

1256
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,360
 And James says, authentic faith,

1257
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,220
 trust, one step, one step, one step, one step.

1258
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,240
 And as it grows and grows,

1259
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,360
 it gets to the point where Abraham and Rahab,

1260
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,560
 whatever you call me to, God, I trust you.

1261
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,840
 I've seen you show up before,

1262
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,200
 I've seen you move in my life, and I trust you.

1263
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,000
 Because living faith grows.

1264
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,240
 And it grows through step by step obedience,

1265
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,960
 whatever that looks like in your life.

1266
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,800
 Tomorrow when you wake up and you make the decision,

1267
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,880
 small, ordinary moments, I'm gonna trust you, God,

1268
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,320
 I'm gonna live like you say.

1269
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,440
 And when you do, your faith grows.

1270
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,200
 Moment by moment.

1271
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,640
 James did not always have a living faith,

1272
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,540
 land in the plane.

1273
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,280
 I think one of the reasons he's so passionate,

1274
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,480
 you read the verses, you're like, dang, James,

1275
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,540
 you're just like, boom,

1276
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,240
 is because James spent so many years,

1277
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,360
 he grew up as a little Jewish boy,

1278
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,880
 and he had this dead religion, dead faith,

1279
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,680
 for years and years and years,

1280
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,280
 until one day his brother comes back from the grave,

1281
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,160
 and he decides, I'm gonna go all in,

1282
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,560
 I believe who you say you are, Jesus.

1283
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,480
 You died on the cross for my sins.

1284
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,320
 My brother paid for my sin.

1285
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,200
 He paid for your sin, paid for every sin

1286
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,480
 that ever has been committed by all of humanity,

1287
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,160
 because he loved the world so much, he would give his life.

1288
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,020
 And he believed that, and all of a sudden,

1289
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,120
 his dead Jewish religion became a living, active,

1290
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,860
 life-changing faith, and he spent the rest of his life

1291
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,360
 telling the world about the Messiah who can save anybody,

1292
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,000
 no matter what they've done,

1293
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,160
 if they'll simply receive that free gift

1294
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,520
 that Jesus has offered them,

1295
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,320
 when he offered his life for them, for you, for me,

1296
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,200
 and then begin to walk in light of that faith

1297
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,960
 and live it out, not to earn God's love,

1298
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,880
 but because you have it already.

1299
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,960
 And the faith grows, and I think he's so passionate,

1300
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,360
 'cause he lived dead faith, and then he had living faith,

1301
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,800
 and he gave his life.

1302
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,680
 And years later, after Jesus, his brother,

1303
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,340
 had gone back to heaven, he was killed for his faith,

1304
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:51,160
 for the living Messiah that he believed in,

1305
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,260
 that his living faith was used to spread the message

1306
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,020
 of the gospel all over the ancient world.

1307
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,920
 That same living faith is alive inside of this room

1308
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,000
 through so many of you who are living and operating

1309
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,160
 based on your faith.

1310
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,480
 You made decisions today

1311
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,400
 because you believe he's the son of God.

1312
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,240
 He's real, he's alive, he's king, and you operate,

1313
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,320
 and I'm so proud of you.

1314
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,840
 Others of you, you need to hear this.

1315
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,000
 You're not a believer, you're not a Christian.

1316
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,560
 I love you, I don't have any motive

1317
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,480
 other than I want you to spend eternity with God in heaven,

1318
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,800
 but that only happens one way,

1319
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,440
 not through being a better person or trying harder tomorrow.

1320
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,500
 It happens through accepting the free gift of Jesus

1321
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,340
 on the cross.

1322
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,160
 I believe you, God.

1323
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,560
 I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner.

1324
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,800
 I don't deserve to go to heaven, I'm a sinner.

1325
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,720
 I'll never be able to earn my relationship with you,

1326
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,300
 but I believe you died for me,

1327
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:40,460
 and I receive your gift.

1328
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,720
 You died in my place,

1329
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,080
 and I'm gonna live eternally with you

1330
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,740
 because you made a way, and I believe that.

1331
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,280
 James says that's living faith,

1332
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,960
 and that's the type of faith that begins to transform a life,

1333
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,280
 eventually the world around you.

1334
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,440
 Let me pray.

1335
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:08,700
 Father, there is no one here who you,

1336
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,980
 or who anyone in the world loves as much as you do.

1337
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,380
 Every person here is loved more by you than their parents,

1338
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,120
 than their spouse, than their future spouse,

1339
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,020
 than anyone who has ever lived.

1340
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:25,520
 No one wants them to spend eternity

1341
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,160
 in heaven more than you do,

1342
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,360
 and so I pray that you would do what only you can do,

1343
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,560
 which is right now, you would soften hearts of people

1344
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,280
 who are lying to themselves,

1345
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,280
 saying, "I actually believe that,"

1346
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,000
 or, "I am a Christian, I'm gonna try harder,"

1347
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,360
 and you would pierce through the noise and the fog

1348
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,560
 and the lies and the religion,

1349
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,100
 and you would allow them to, in their heart,

1350
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,240
 believe you're who you say you are.

1351
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,720
 Son of God who died in our place,

1352
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,120
 who gave your life for us and came back alive,

1353
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,160
 and because of that, if we receive that gift,

1354
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,040
 we will live forever.

1355
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,160
 I pray that you would allow living faith to mark our lives,

1356
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,000
 in any parts of my heart and any of our hearts

1357
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,100
 of those who know you,

1358
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:18,100
 where there is lack of life and there's death,

1359
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,520
 would you take ground, would you start with me?

1360
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,760
 Help us to be more and more like Jesus,

1361
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,840
 the Son of God, the Savior of the world,

1362
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,280
 the half-brother of James.

1363
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,080
 We worship you in song, amen.

1364
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:40,080
