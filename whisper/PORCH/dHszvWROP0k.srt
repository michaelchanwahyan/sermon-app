00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:20,640
 - Good evening, Dallas.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,560
 Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,400
 My name is Garrett.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,220
 If we've never met before,

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,520
 if we've never spent time together before,

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,080
 I wanna welcome everybody who's tuning in,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,100
 not in this exact room,

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,880
 whether you're in Fort Worth or Houston

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,400
 or somewhere else in all the creation.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,440
 So glad you guys are gonna be a part of this tonight.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,980
 Hey, I wanna start by asking you this question.

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,120
 Have you ever had a moment in life

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,480
 that seemed to throw you into a little bit of a pit?

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,160
 I'm not talking about a mere problem.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,280
 I'm talking about a problem that you get stuck in

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
 and you can't seem to climb your way out of.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
 Like it graduates from a problem to an all out pit.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,720
 You ever had that moment?

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,800
 Let me tell you about the first one I had

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,060
 when I came on staff.

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,640
 So I became a resident here in the fall of 2013.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,960
 So almost five years ago.

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,720
 And as soon as I became a resident,

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,200
 just a few weeks later was the biggest

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,280
 porch event of the year.

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,160
 It's called Launch-A-Treat.

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,280
 I'm not sure if any of you have heard of it

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,000
 or enjoyed a good time out there.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,720
 But the first event of me being a resident

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,960
 was that we were gonna go have a Launch-A-Treat.

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
 Now keep in mind, think like first day on the job,

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,000
 first few weeks on the job,

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 you really wanna do right.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,160
 You don't wanna mess anything up.

36
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,000
 You know, you don't want anybody

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,520
 to think you're not pulling your weight.

38
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,460
 That's kind of the mentality.

39
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,000
 Make a good first impression.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,940
 That's kind of the mentality

41
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,960
 that I'm coming into this event with.

42
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,940
 And David approached me

43
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,800
 and we did not know each other well at this point.

44
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,920
 And he just said, "Hey, you have one job.

45
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,120
 "In this opening session, you are the balloon drop guy."

46
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,800
 And I like looked up in the room.

47
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,280
 And in this room,

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,360
 where there were gonna be 1,000 young adults,

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,660
 many of you seated right there in that room,

50
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,120
 there's this huge net of balloons,

51
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,120
 a tube of balloons going across the room from left to right.

52
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,320
 And he says, "Hey, at the end of the national anthem,"

53
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,520
 'cause there's like a game day theme,

54
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,100
 and so there's gonna be a national anthem go off

55
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,360
 and confetti and all this stuff.

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
 He said, "At the end of the national anthem, okay,

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,920
 "like somewhere around, you know,

58
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,560
 "or the land of the brave, you know, or land of the free."

59
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,200
 Sorry, I'm an American, I love this country.

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
 But anyway, so anyway, he's like,

61
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,880
 "Hey, at that part, I want you to start pulling."

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,280
 You can see why he wasn't confident.

63
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,720
 So anyway, he starts, he tells me,

64
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,160
 "Hey, you just start pulling that rope."

65
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,180
 Because what happened was the tube was held together

66
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,780
 by a rope that went over the sidewall

67
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,920
 and then back in the back corner.

68
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,720
 So I'm in like the back left corner of the room

69
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,880
 and I'm just waiting.

70
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,640
 And there are people that are screaming

71
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,920
 and hollering, "Launch your treats here.

72
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,740
 "It's Labor Day weekend, three-day weekend,

73
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,000
 "about to have a great time."

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,480
 And everything has gone off perfectly, it's amazing.

75
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,100
 And then it is time for the balloon drop.

76
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,260
 So I start to pull right at the ending moment.

77
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,440
 I mean, everybody's standing up.

78
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
 I mean, it's just an epic start to the weekend.

79
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,560
 And I start to pull and all of a sudden,

80
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,400
 instead of the rope kind of like loosening out

81
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,320
 from under the net, and in theory, that's what would happen.

82
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 And then the balloons would fall

83
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,600
 and the people would cheer and I would feel good inside.

84
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,360
 In theory, that's what was gonna happen.

85
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,960
 But instead of the rope kind of unwinding,

86
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,840
 as I could see it from the back corner of the room,

87
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
 all of a sudden on the far right side

88
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,000
 of this big, huge balloon tube,

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,380
 it's like kind of bunching up

90
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,280
 and kind of contorting a little bit.

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,840
 I'm like, "I don't think it's supposed to be like that."

92
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
 And I start to pull and it gets a little harder

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,880
 and it starts to kind of contort more.

94
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,920
 And all of a sudden there's more tension in the rope.

95
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,240
 And I'm like, "I don't think this is right."

96
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,040
 And at this point, it's decision time.

97
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,200
 'Cause I'm thinking, "Okay, what if the balloons don't fall

98
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,480
 "because the new guy didn't pull hard enough?"

99
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,640
 That is not going to happen.

100
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,840
 So I pulled a little more and there was this loud pop

101
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,960
 and the entire tube of balloons,

102
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,000
 it was held to the ceiling

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
 and the entire right half of the tube of balloons

104
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,080
 starts to fall toward the ground.

105
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,760
 People literally scream like a building's falling down.

106
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,640
 And so people look up and they're terrified.

107
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
 And this balloon tube, it's like, it's just balloons,

108
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,480
 it's not gonna hurt you people.

109
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
 But I mean, people yell audibly,

110
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,420
 it's a room and a crowd,

111
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,280
 people don't know what that pop sound is.

112
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,640
 And so they look up and this balloon thing

113
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,260
 is kind of floating down.

114
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,260
 And then it stops in a very unfortunate position.

115
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,040
 Some would say an anatomical position.

116
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:05,280
 I wish I could tell you that man you see in that photograph.

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
 Oh, let's let it have its moment.

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
 Go ahead and put it back up there.

119
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
 I wish that I could say that man's back

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,360
 that you see with someone else, but that is yours truly.

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,960
 And that's after it all calmed down, okay?

122
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,360
 And by the way, just so you know,

123
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,080
 it wasn't like three or four people

124
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 in the corner of the room were like,

125
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,760
 you know, if you tilt your head just right,

126
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,040
 it kind of looks phallic.

127
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
 It was like 1000 people looked up and were like,

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,260
 oh, it's a balloon penis, clearly.

129
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,560
 (congregation laughing)

130
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
 Obviously.

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,240
 It was one of the worst moments of my life.

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,320
 Some of you, it's your first time,

133
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,200
 and you're like, this is what happened to church

134
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,840
 while I was gone.

135
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,480
 Crazy.

136
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,480
 So, oh, wait, let me do my David laugh.

137
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
 (laughing)

138
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,760
 So I had this moment.

139
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,240
 I heard David picked on me a few weeks ago.

140
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
 I had to come back and get him.

141
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,240
 So I had this moment and all of a sudden,

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
 so first off, that moment itself is a pit, okay?

143
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
 So that moment itself is like, everybody knows.

144
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,880
 I mean, all you have to do is look back.

145
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
 There's a guy in the back left corner.

146
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
 He's clear with the balloon drop problem.

147
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
 And so, but then after that,

148
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,120
 I stayed in a pit of embarrassment for a long time.

149
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,680
 The entire retreat, I was walking around

150
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
 just with embarrassment, just like covering me.

151
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,760
 I mean, can you imagine?

152
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,400
 Every time I ran into somebody, I was like,

153
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,640
 I'm trying to meet new people.

154
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
 You know, like I'm new here.

155
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,760
 I'm new to town.

156
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,640
 I'm new to the team.

157
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,800
 And I'm trying to meet people.

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,120
 And I'm just completely just underwater

159
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,760
 with this idea that I am the problem here.

160
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,800
 And it was just so embarrassing.

161
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
 So the embarrassment was like a pit to me.

162
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,680
 I mean, I was stuck in it.

163
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
 I couldn't climb my way out.

164
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,480
 I tried to tell myself like, oh, you know,

165
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,320
 mistakes happen.

166
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,640
 And you know, if the apostle Paul himself

167
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,880
 had been pulling the rope, that would have happened.

168
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,120
 I mean, it's clearly a predestined problem.

169
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
 You know what I mean?

170
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,440
 So I'm trying to make myself feel better,

171
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,320
 but I'm stuck in this pit of embarrassment.

172
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,280
 And I can't get out.

173
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,880
 At first it was a problem,

174
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,840
 but then it graduated to an all out pit.

175
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
 I mean, I was embarrassed for weeks.

176
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,440
 When I was meeting new people on staff,

177
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,040
 I was afraid it would become staff legend.

178
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,200
 And those fears have come true, by the way.

179
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,760
 But it just, it stuck with me.

180
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,680
 And I couldn't figure out the mental game of like,

181
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,080
 how do I not be ashamed of this?

182
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,960
 And that sounds really silly, but I know this.

183
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,440
 Life can throw you into a pit

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,920
 a lot more violently than that, can it?

185
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,520
 Only this time, there's no funny story.

186
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,360
 It's just hard.

187
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,680
 And when I say the word pit tonight,

188
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
 I want you to know exactly what I mean by that.

189
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
 When I say that word, what I'm talking about

190
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,200
 is I'm talking about something

191
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,840
 that could be emotional or actual.

192
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,480
 By an emotional pit, what I mean is,

193
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
 I mean an emotional problem

194
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
 that you can't exactly solve yourself,

195
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,160
 like depression or anxiety or sadness.

196
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,200
 When I say an actual pit, what I'm talking about is,

197
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,440
 I'm talking about a situation that's really real

198
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,480
 and it's really wrong,

199
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,040
 and you really can't get out of it, like probation.

200
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,320
 Like you just got broken up with.

201
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,000
 Like there was a divorce and it continues to affect you.

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,560
 Like there was a DUI back there,

203
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,440
 and yeah, that moment itself was a pit,

204
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,320
 and that was an actual physical situation you were in,

205
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,160
 but on top of that,

206
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,960
 you've got the emotional after effects of that situation.

207
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,480
 Sometimes we can dig a pit for ourselves.

208
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,880
 Like if you lie and cheat and get caught,

209
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
 and then you're in a drama-filled relationship,

210
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
 you dug that pit, that's one you dug for yourself.

211
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
 Sometimes other people can dig one for you

212
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,080
 and just throw you in.

213
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,120
 That's like when you walk into work one day

214
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,600
 and somebody says, "You don't work here anymore."

215
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
 Life just throws you in it.

216
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,680
 And then sometimes pits can just happen

217
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
 because we live on earth,

218
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,200
 and that is to say a pit-filled world.

219
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,240
 And you didn't do anything,

220
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,080
 but you just kind of, nobody else did anything either,

221
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,360
 but you just kind of inherited.

222
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,840
 Like you don't love being single,

223
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
 and the Bible says it's a gift,

224
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,360
 but you just can't really get there,

225
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
 and it feels like time's ticking away,

226
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,720
 and family just seems like less and less

227
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,000
 of a possibility for you.

228
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,840
 A pit is a problem that has graduated

229
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,040
 into something that you are all out stuck in

230
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,280
 that you do not wanna be in.

231
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,800
 It's a situation you want out of,

232
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
 but do not have the power to get out of.

233
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,200
 And what I wanna talk about tonight

234
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,040
 is what you need to know when you're stuck in a pit,

235
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,320
 because we've all been in them.

236
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,360
 The balloon drop story, that's fun and games,

237
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,240
 but that was not my worst pit, not by a long shot.

238
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,640
 I've been in the pit of a pornography addiction,

239
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,600
 partying, thinking that's better than God,

240
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,120
 and then not being able to stop

241
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
 once I figured out God was better,

242
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,640
 still not being able to stop.

243
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,760
 Being ashamed of myself, ashamed of the story.

244
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,800
 There was a time when I couldn't say that to anybody,

245
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,880
 let alone myself, the way I just said it to you.

246
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,400
 The pit of shame and guilt from the life that I'd lived

247
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
 before I was walking with Jesus.

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,040
 The pit of family death, lost a mom, lost a brother.

249
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,000
 I'm gonna tell you a little more about that tonight.

250
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,360
 Life can go really low.

251
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,480
 And we're gonna see tonight a man in the Scriptures

252
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
 whose life has gone very, very low,

253
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,800
 and that is of course the man Jonah.

254
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,240
 And he prays a prayer in Jonah chapter two

255
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
 that we're gonna see tonight,

256
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,840
 that offers some insight that is transferable

257
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,400
 from his pit to mine and to yours.

258
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,720
 And if we look closely at that prayer,

259
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,240
 I am confident that his is a prayer worth praying for you,

260
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
 for me, no matter what your pit is right now,

261
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,840
 no matter what you're stuck in, no matter whether it is.

262
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,320
 Any of the things I just named

263
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,960
 are something that I'm not creative enough

264
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
 to even think about ahead of time.

265
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,280
 Jonah chapter two.

266
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,160
 Now, as David taught last week,

267
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,360
 Jonah was more of a warning to avoid, right?

268
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,600
 So Jonah, in chapter one, we find him on the run from God,

269
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
 he's running from God, he wants nothing to do

270
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
 with God's assignment for his life.

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,400
 And so he runs and he lands himself in a pit,

272
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,760
 a literal one, the belly of a fish.

273
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,600
 But in chapter two,

274
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,680
 something about him has dramatically changed.

275
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,840
 And there's something about him

276
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,520
 that he is inside the belly of a literal fish, okay?

277
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,000
 Talk about a pit, he is below sea level, okay?

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 In an animal, okay?

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,520
 That's where he is at, in the stomach of an animal,

280
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,040
 moving around, and he prays a prayer out of that pit

281
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,200
 that gives him insight about how we can relate to ours.

282
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,560
 Now, I wanna pause right here, just before we dive in,

283
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,800
 I understand that many of you have an intellectual problem

284
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,680
 with picturing a man in the belly of a fish, okay?

285
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,080
 Like, you just can't get there, it seems weird,

286
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,200
 it's too miraculous for you, it's a whale of a tale,

287
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
 it's just too much, okay?

288
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,640
 So however you would say it,

289
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,320
 there's just no way that you can possibly picture

290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,560
 a man inside the belly of a fish.

291
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,400
 And I just wanna tell you,

292
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,360
 I wanna be an intellectually honest person too.

293
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,480
 So I wanna tell you how I think about that.

294
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,600
 Jesus believed in the literal story of Jonah.

295
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,480
 And Jesus rose again from the grave, all right?

296
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,080
 So listen, if you ever predict your own death

297
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,720
 and rise again from the grave,

298
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,920
 whatever you say about Jonah will be good enough for me.

299
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,880
 I will just believe everything you believe,

300
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,560
 we will do everything you say,

301
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,720
 and you can have Easter, you can be the boss, okay?

302
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,160
 But until then, because Jesus actually predicted

303
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
 his own death and rose again from the grave,

304
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,440
 we're gonna go with whatever he believes.

305
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,520
 And he believed that this was an actual literal story.

306
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,120
 So here comes Jonah, prayers from the pit, chapter two.

307
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,160
 From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God,

308
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,760
 from inside the fish, that is a very low, low in life,

309
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,280
 that is a very low valley,

310
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,520
 that is what you'd be tempted to call rock bottom.

311
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,120
 Let's just affirm this is really, really, really bad.

312
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,640
 And he said in this bad moment, in my distress,

313
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,720
 how interesting is this?

314
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,840
 In my distress, I called to the Lord

315
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,680
 and he answered me, past tense.

316
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,000
 For from deep in the realm of the dead,

317
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I called for help and you listened to my cry, past tense.

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,040
 Now, let me tell you why that's crazy to me.

319
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,120
 If it was me, I would not be in the belly of a fish going,

320
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,360
 God, I called and you answered.

321
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,440
 I would say, please answer.

322
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,600
 Current, like I'm in this problem right now,

323
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,640
 I'm calling, will you please answer?

324
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,440
 From deep, from the realm of the dead,

325
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,000
 I am calling for help, please listen to my cry.

326
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
 But he's praying past tense as if it's already done.

327
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,560
 Where's that confidence come from?

328
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,600
 How's that possible?

329
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,920
 How can you pray like that in the middle of that situation?

330
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,520
 I'm more tempted to pray like, hello, hello, hello.

331
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,680
 God, are you there?

332
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,040
 Are you there, right there?

333
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,000
 And he is saying, God, just calmly, like God's right there.

334
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,960
 I called to you, you answered me.

335
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,000
 From deep in the realm of the dead,

336
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,720
 I called for help and you listened to my cry.

337
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,480
 How can you pray with confidence like that in your pit?

338
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,760
 The answer is not because you know

339
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,000
 you're gonna get out of there,

340
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,800
 but because you know God is with you there.

341
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,880
 Jonah knows God is right there.

342
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,800
 He's not distant, he's not far away.

343
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,720
 He's not just pushing Jonah off.

344
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,320
 He is close by.

345
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,120
 So one thing you might wanna know about your pit

346
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,160
 is that God hears your prayers from the pit.

347
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,840
 God, the God, the creator God,

348
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,560
 hears your prayers from the pit.

349
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,520
 However low it is, no matter what your pit is called,

350
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,440
 no matter what you've done,

351
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,960
 no matter what you did to get yourself into it,

352
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,040
 no matter what somebody else did to get you into it,

353
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,160
 wherever you are in life,

354
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,000
 however low rock bottom is for you,

355
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,720
 God hears your prayers from that very moment.

356
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,160
 And you never know when you are gonna need that.

357
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,040
 I mentioned to you that I lost my brother.

358
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,520
 I've shared that story here at the porch

359
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,400
 before a few months ago,

360
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,000
 but it was three years ago and it was during church

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,040
 over at the Fort Worth campus.

362
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,040
 And I got a phone call and it was his girlfriend

363
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,040
 who said, "Hey, he didn't make it."

364
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,880
 It's the kind of thing

365
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,680
 that doesn't really need any explanation.

366
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,120
 I had been there before

367
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,000
 when my mom had passed away a few years prior.

368
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And when that happened, I walked outside,

369
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,640
 I hung up the phone, walked outside,

370
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,400
 and I got in my car door and it was the instant pit.

371
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,920
 Okay, some of you had a moment like this,

372
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,200
 some of you maybe not,

373
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,360
 but that is a moment where the loss of life

374
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,880
 of someone who is close to you

375
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,000
 is just the most close reality.

376
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,120
 There's nowhere to run from it.

377
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,160
 You're just in it.

378
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,000
 You're just there.

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,840
 There's nothing you can say.

380
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,160
 There's nothing you can do.

381
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,400
 There's nothing you can do.

382
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,040
 You can't hug your way out of it.

383
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,480
 You can't pray your way out of it.

384
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,440
 Nobody, I mean, there's nothing you can do.

385
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,320
 You are in a pit.

386
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,840
 You can't encourage your way out of it.

387
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,200
 There's nothing you can do for that,

388
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,160
 at least immediate moment, you are stuck.

389
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,800
 And what I did was I hung up the phone,

390
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
 I hopped in my car,

391
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,280
 got ready to get on the highway.

392
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,120
 But before I put the car in reverse,

393
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,800
 I just shut the door and I looked out the windshield,

394
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,960
 put my hands around the steering wheel.

395
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,600
 And I said one sentence out loud,

396
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,360
 God, I can't see you, but I know you're there.

397
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,240
 That was it.

398
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,080
 And I walked through the hardest week of my entire life,

399
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,800
 not alone.

400
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,880
 It was a pit.

401
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,920
 No little, there was nothing anybody can say.

402
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,120
 No pastor's trick, no preacher's trick.

403
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,240
 There was no little saying.

404
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,200
 There's no little Christian proverb out there

405
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,160
 that can take away all the pain of that exact situation.

406
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,080
 But I wasn't alone.

407
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,440
 As soon as I was there, I knew God was with me.

408
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,200
 It made a difference, big time.

409
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,120
 And you never know, some of you are there right now

410
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,720
 and you just need to know God is with you.

411
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,960
 He is aware.

412
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,760
 You might not be experiencing his best right now.

413
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,200
 And that might mean that you have gotten

414
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,720
 a little frustrated towards him,

415
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
 or maybe not even spoke to him or thought about him

416
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,200
 in a long, long, long, long time.

417
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,040
 But guess what?

418
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,960
 He is right there.

419
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,800
 It says in the scripture,

420
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,120
 God is near to the broken heart.

421
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,760
 And that includes you even if you broke your own heart.

422
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,120
 As we saw last week, you can run from God,

423
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,400
 but you can't outrun him.

424
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,400
 There is no way you could ever end up alone, truly alone,

425
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,160
 because God can hear your prayers from the pit.

426
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,240
 You need to know that if you're in a hard spot.

427
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,520
 Verse three, back to Jonah's prayer.

428
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,400
 You, God, hurled me into the depths,

429
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,480
 into the very heart of the seas.

430
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
 And the current swirled about me.

431
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
 So that's his physical situation right there.

432
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,320
 Literal, the current swirled about me.

433
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,560
 That's not spiritual language.

434
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,080
 It's not one of those, you know, you read the prayer

435
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,440
 and you're like, the current swirled about you.

436
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,280
 What does that even mean?

437
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,600
 It literally means the currents swirled about him

438
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,520
 while he was in the water.

439
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,800
 All your waves and breakers, you're like, what are those?

440
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,160
 Literal waves, they swept over me.

441
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,680
 I said, I've been banished from your sight.

442
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,720
 Surely you can't see this, God.

443
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
 That's how he used to feel.

444
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,000
 Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.

445
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,160
 The engulfing waters, not a metaphor, real deal.

446
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,440
 The engulfing waters threatened me.

447
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,860
 The deep surrounded me.

448
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,080
 Seaweed was wrapped around my head.

449
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,840
 I don't know how bad it's going for you,

450
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,520
 but you do not have seaweed on your face right now.

451
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,420
 I'm looking out at you, no seaweed.

452
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,640
 To the roots of the mountains, I sank down.

453
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,880
 The earth beneath barred me in forever.

454
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,680
 Some of you know what that feels like,

455
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,920
 sands, seaweed, all right, without the seaweed.

456
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,800
 They just feel like you're locked in it forever.

457
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,480
 Like you can't get out.

458
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,720
 You've been sad for what feels like a decade.

459
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,580
 You've been upset since somebody broke up with you.

460
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,340
 You haven't been yourself since you lost your job.

461
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,500
 Some of you know what that feels like.

462
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,220
 Listen to what Jonah says.

463
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,420
 Listen to what he knows that you might need to know

464
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,980
 and I might need to know.

465
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,520
 But you, Lord, my God brought my life up from the pit.

466
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,660
 Now that's another one of those interesting things to say.

467
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,220
 How exactly can you pray,

468
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,660
 he brought my life up from the pit while you are still there?

469
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,420
 How can that be?

470
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,820
 Now he moves to confidence that his situation is changing.

471
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,940
 How does he know his situation is changing

472
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,540
 in the moment while he's in it?

473
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,060
 Does he know God's plan for the situation

474
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,900
 before it happens?

475
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,940
 Nope.

476
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,580
 Can his prayers make God change the situation?

477
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,360
 You know, kind of name and claim your outcome

478
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,060
 and you know, kind of pray God into doing what you want?

479
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,900
 Nope.

480
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,460
 So how, how can you know your situation is changing

481
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,380
 while you're still in it?

482
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,100
 Here's how Jonah knew.

483
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,100
 Jonah knew the pit itself was God changing the situation.

484
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,500
 That very moment, that very situation,

485
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,780
 that very place he felt stuck was actually moving him

486
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
 back into the plan of God.

487
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,900
 Think about it.

488
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
 He was in a fish.

489
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,500
 Fish move.

490
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,940
 They swim places.

491
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,020
 And right at that very moment,

492
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,140
 Jonah is being transported back

493
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,900
 to the original purpose of God for his life.

494
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,060
 Jonah is actually being taken back to the thing

495
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,920
 God told him to do in chapter one.

496
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,540
 That very moment was not,

497
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,260
 and it feels so bad when you're in a pit,

498
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,020
 it feels like God is punishing you, not pursuing you.

499
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,540
 But what Jonah realized was this is not this moment,

500
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,380
 this dark, dark moment is not God pushing me away

501
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,860
 and putting me in timeout.

502
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,540
 This is God helping me make up for lost time.

503
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,900
 This is him acting in my life.

504
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,340
 The punishment is the pursuit of God.

505
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,060
 There are so many moments in life

506
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,180
 when we feel like God's judging us

507
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,540
 when judgment is not anywhere on his mind.

508
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,680
 And when the circumstance feels bad,

509
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,140
 we just assume there's no way it could be constructive,

510
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,820
 no way it could be helpful, no way it could be useful,

511
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
 no way it could be doing anything to you

512
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,580
 or through you or for you.

513
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,180
 And God is so much bigger than you, man.

514
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,240
 I have no idea what you're up against right now.

515
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
 And I don't wanna get up here

516
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,660
 and give you simple answers and pretend I do.

517
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,920
 I know better, life's hard, it's complicated.

518
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,020
 But I know this, what God has done for Jonah

519
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,940
 and what God has done all throughout the scripture

520
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,100
 from start to finish is take something

521
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,040
 that feels impossible and random and meaningless,

522
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,460
 like it's just pain that nobody else maybe even knows about,

523
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,540
 and he uses that very stuck situation

524
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,500
 that you can't get out of to get you into the situation

525
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,600
 that you should be in.

526
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
 Does it all over the scripture.

527
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,000
 Jonah realized the pit is the plan of God.

528
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,920
 I feel loved right now.

529
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,200
 You Lord are bringing my life up from the pit

530
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,400
 at this very moment.

531
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,540
 So I just wanna tell you simply,

532
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,160
 God has a plan for your pit.

533
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,060
 God has a plan for your pit.

534
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,320
 And look, I was scared to write that down

535
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,680
 because I thought some of you would think,

536
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,400
 oh, the preacher always says there's a plan.

537
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,300
 Of course, the guy with the microphone said there's a plan.

538
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,660
 Is that just what they teach you to say?

539
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,380
 When do they pull you guys aside and teach you to say that?

540
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,300
 Listen, the Bible teaches all over the place.

541
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,700
 Jonah is just one example.

542
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,340
 That God has a plan for every pit

543
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,720
 that you could possibly ever endure or ever see.

544
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,500
 And I am not telling you,

545
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,820
 I am not telling you that whatever you're facing is easy.

546
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,140
 I know better, I've seen pain, I've seen hardship.

547
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,580
 I know it's not easy.

548
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,980
 I'm also not telling you that you can know

549
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,220
 every single detail and explanation

550
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
 for why hardship in your life exists.

551
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,540
 I know better than that too.

552
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,400
 I'm not saying we can know all the reasons

553
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,640
 for why hardship is in your life.

554
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,440
 I'm saying we can know at least one.

555
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,340
 Because God is after you.

556
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,980
 He wants to connect with you.

557
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,840
 And he wants you to connect you

558
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,020
 for his purpose for you from here on out.

559
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,820
 That's at least one thing he's doing, at the minimum.

560
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,580
 I've seen God do it in my life over and over.

561
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,700
 Another example from kind of some family hardship,

562
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,260
 well, not kind of family hardship, absolute family tragedy.

563
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,260
 When I was 18 years old, I got a phone call,

564
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,460
 another pit, I gotta stop answering my phone.

565
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,420
 But I got a phone call and it was,

566
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,020
 this time it was, this was before the previous story.

567
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,260
 So this was when I was 18 and I got a phone call

568
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,820
 and they just said, hey, your mom is sick.

569
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
 And they're pretty sure that it's cancer.

570
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,700
 And a few phone calls later and I found out

571
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,140
 over the next few weeks, it was cancer.

572
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,680
 It's a very serious form of ovarian cancer.

573
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,780
 And which is very lethal and very scary.

574
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,180
 And my mom and I, from that point,

575
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,740
 got to share two more years of life together on this earth.

576
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,580
 Two more years.

577
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,140
 And you need to understand something.

578
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,500
 Before that two years, the previous 18 years

579
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,940
 were marked by pretty much spiritual shallowness.

580
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,740
 We never really talked about God.

581
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,140
 We go to church on Christmas and Easter,

582
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,260
 poke our heads in, I assumed we were Christians

583
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,600
 'cause after all, we were Texans.

584
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,800
 And so I just assumed that we're Christians

585
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,620
 and she's a Christian and I'm a Christian

586
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,600
 and that's how it is.

587
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
 But that's what you think about at weddings and funerals

588
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,080
 and stuff like that.

589
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,360
 And it was just complete shallowness.

590
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,080
 Never really, I don't think I have a single memory

591
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,360
 of her talking about God before the diagnosis.

592
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,680
 And over the next two years,

593
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,900
 God didn't just revitalize our relationship with each other,

594
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,680
 but God actually brought us

595
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,880
 into real relationship with him.

596
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,560
 We talked about Christ

597
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,560
 in ways we never would have been willing before.

598
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,880
 We talked about prayer, we talked about faith,

599
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,600
 we talked how to deal with the cancerous pit

600
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,440
 that we were all in

601
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,640
 and our whole family didn't ask to be thrown into.

602
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,120
 We had conversations like the one

603
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,280
 we're having right here tonight,

604
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,880
 wrestling with the mysteries and the hurt

605
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,520
 and the tension of the unknowns.

606
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,960
 We had all those conversations.

607
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,560
 And yeah, it was a pit.

608
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,040
 And yeah, it didn't end the way we wanted.

609
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,360
 And yeah, it was a long two years

610
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,920
 to see your mom struggle like that.

611
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,520
 And I don't pretend to know,

612
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,920
 I would not insult my mom's memory

613
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,720
 by even suggesting that it was easy

614
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
 or that I'm satisfied

615
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,960
 'cause I know everything I wanna know.

616
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,240
 I don't know everything about that situation I wanna know.

617
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,960
 I know one thing about that situation I need to know.

618
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,200
 God's plan was to come for both of us

619
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
 and he got us both.

620
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,800
 He got both of us.

621
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,040
 I turned my life over to him right in that very season.

622
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,280
 I knew when that introduced itself into my life,

623
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,320
 I knew I was either gonna be all in with God

624
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,400
 or I was gonna be all out with God.

625
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,920
 That was a fork in the road for me.

626
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,480
 A pit will do that to you, by the way, with God.

627
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,560
 And I realized I'm either gonna be all in with you, God,

628
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
 or I'm gonna be all out with you

629
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,600
 and I'm just gonna rage against this situation

630
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
 because I don't understand it, it's wrong,

631
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
 how could a loving God do this?

632
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,400
 And I'm out and those are my two options.

633
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
 And I'm literally praying between those two options

634
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
 as an 18 year old thinking about them.

635
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,960
 And God used that very situation

636
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,360
 to soften my heart towards him

637
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,000
 because I saw the way he had softened

638
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,040
 my mom's heart towards him.

639
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,080
 It changed everything.

640
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,000
 I don't know why all the pain was necessary to do that.

641
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,640
 I don't pretend to know.

642
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,160
 I know that the pit itself created space

643
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,640
 for the plan of God, which is always kind.

644
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,680
 I don't know how he's gonna do that in your life.

645
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,000
 I have no idea.

646
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
 God's way too creative to do the same thing

647
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,600
 in the same way to you.

648
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,280
 God's way too creative to do the same thing

649
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
 in the same way twice, all right?

650
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,760
 So I have no idea exactly how he's gonna show up for you.

651
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,600
 I don't know what the specific purposes are,

652
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,200
 but I know that there's purpose.

653
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,440
 Nothing is random, nothing is meaningless.

654
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,280
 And even when you think you're stuck,

655
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,880
 you have the opportunity if you trust him

656
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,720
 to actually be moving back into the plan of God.

657
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,600
 He's that good.

658
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,800
 Back to Jonah one more time, verse seven.

659
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,760
 "When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord,

660
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,240
 "and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple."

661
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,960
 And then this is his finest moment, last two verses.

662
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,360
 "Those who cling," listen to this, this is so big.

663
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,840
 "Those who cling to worthless idols

664
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,000
 "turn away from God's love for them,

665
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,600
 "but I, with shouts of grateful praise,

666
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,400
 "will sacrifice to you what I have vowed I will make good.

667
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
 "I will say salvation comes from the Lord."

668
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,600
 End of prayer.

669
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,480
 Now look, I don't know how you would end this prayer,

670
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,640
 but I would pray by saying,

671
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,840
 God, now that we've gotten all that sorted out,

672
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,400
 get me the heck out of here.

673
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,960
 That's how I would have ended the prayer.

674
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,720
 But he doesn't even pray anything about his situation.

675
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,920
 Nothing about the situation does he even mention.

676
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,360
 It's almost like he forgot about it.

677
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
 And he's just saying, salvation is from God.

678
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,440
 My devotion is going to God.

679
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,920
 Worthless idols, ha, I've done that, I'm out.

680
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
 I'm not gonna do that anymore.

681
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,400
 That's what I was doing

682
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,160
 when I was chasing the idol of comfort

683
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,680
 that led me out of the plan of God

684
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,320
 and into a pit in the first place.

685
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,840
 I am done with clinging to worthless idols

686
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,320
 because that's just turning away from God's love for me,

687
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
 he says right there in verse eight.

688
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,000
 Those who cling to worthless idols

689
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,080
 turn away from God's love.

690
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,200
 And I'm done doing that.

691
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,520
 God, you have all my devotion.

692
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,360
 End of prayer.

693
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,440
 He gives his devotion first,

694
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,600
 regardless of whether his situation gets better.

695
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,360
 Can we just admit we don't do that?

696
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,040
 You know what we do with our devotion to God

697
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,480
 while we're in a pit?

698
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
 We like to bargain with God.

699
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,320
 You know what I mean?

700
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,160
 Here's what that sounds like.

701
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,800
 God, if you get me out of this DUI,

702
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,440
 I will never get drunk again.

703
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,640
 I'm done, I'll be your man.

704
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,000
 If you will let me not be pregnant,

705
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,080
 I will never sleep with him again, I promise.

706
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,360
 Or anyone else, won't even think about it.

707
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,680
 Sex will be out of my vocabulary,

708
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,760
 won't even talk about it.

709
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,680
 Just get me out of this situation

710
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,120
 and I will devote myself to you.

711
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,920
 God, if you can get us back together after the breakup,

712
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,280
 we will honor you, we will honor you, we will honor you.

713
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,680
 And I'm telling you, that's so backward.

714
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,400
 Jonah doesn't even wait for that.

715
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,080
 He doesn't hold back his devotion.

716
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,120
 He just gives it to God.

717
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,080
 And he says, God, he doesn't say,

718
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,480
 God, if you change this, I'll go with you.

719
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,240
 He says, I'll go with you whether you change this or not.

720
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,040
 Because you're where life is found.

721
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,320
 Some of you, your biggest problem,

722
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,720
 it's not that you're in a pit.

723
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,280
 It's that you don't have anything worth chasing

724
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,160
 if you got out.

725
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,280
 You got worthless idols everywhere.

726
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,200
 Wasn't idol, anything but God.

727
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,720
 Anything, anything but God.

728
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,920
 Money, success, sex, companionship, marriage,

729
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,400
 respect, your resume, anything other than God.

730
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,000
 And if you chase those,

731
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,240
 you turn away from God's love for you.

732
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,680
 That's why Jonah says, hey, let's just settle this deal now.

733
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,520
 While I'm in this pit,

734
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,480
 I'm gonna take advantage of the opportunity

735
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,440
 to decide what kind of man I'm gonna be from here

736
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
 because I am done being the man

737
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,720
 who chases worthless idols.

738
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,560
 I'm going with God no matter what happens,

739
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,520
 if he ever lets me out of here or not.

740
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,880
 The last thing you'd wanna know about being in your pit

741
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,520
 is turning to God right now is your best option.

742
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,280
 That's the best thing you can do.

743
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,840
 No matter how complicated it is,

744
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,720
 even though God might not be a quick fix

745
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,280
 for your situation right now,

746
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,800
 even if that doesn't answer all your questions

747
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,920
 or solve all your problems,

748
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,160
 the best thing you can do at this very moment

749
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,480
 is you can turn to God.

750
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,720
 It is your best option.

751
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,080
 I can remember being a Christian years ago.

752
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,600
 And as a Christian years ago,

753
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,360
 I was so far in the pit of pornography and partying,

754
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,880
 I thought maybe it's not even worth it to turn around.

755
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,240
 I bet God's so mad at me.

756
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,200
 I'm mad at me.

757
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,920
 It might be better just to keep going, man, and give up.

758
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,000
 Not true.

759
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,600
 Your best option is to turn to God right now.

760
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,120
 When we get in a hard situation, we all weigh our options.

761
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,840
 That's what we all have in common.

762
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,720
 And God is always the best one.

763
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,240
 It might not get better fast.

764
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,520
 It might not be a quick fix,

765
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,840
 but it is always the very best choice

766
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,520
 you can make for yourself and those around you.

767
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,280
 It might not uncomplicate things by tomorrow.

768
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,320
 It only takes one decision to complicate things

769
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,820
 and to uncomplicate them, it can take a long time.

770
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,840
 But turning yourself into God, surrendering to Him,

771
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,040
 deciding your devotion will go to Him right now

772
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,400
 is your very best option.

773
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,840
 Some of you, I know, it's like,

774
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,840
 hey, you end up hugging a toilet every weekend.

775
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,400
 You're like, yeah, the headaches are bad.

776
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,380
 And yeah, my friends are not,

777
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,480
 my real friends are disappearing.

778
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,500
 All I got are bar buddies,

779
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,020
 but I mean, I've kind of already gone this far.

780
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,920
 Maybe I should keep going.

781
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,600
 No, that's crazy.

782
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,560
 You should turn yourself back to God now.

783
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,200
 That's the best thing you can do.

784
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
 I just got out of a relationship.

785
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,280
 I thought it was going to the altar.

786
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,100
 What should I do?

787
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,520
 You should turn to God now.

788
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,820
 It is your best option.

789
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,100
 I lost my job.

790
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,940
 What do I do?

791
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,120
 Turn to God right now.

792
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,960
 Start walking with Him.

793
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,800
 Don't wait for some magical, miraculous interruption.

794
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,280
 Don't wait for God to snap His fingers

795
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,800
 and make everything simple again.

796
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,040
 Turn to God now and start walking with Him.

797
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,120
 We'll close with this story.

798
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,240
 When I was 14 years old,

799
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,720
 we got into a crazy situation, life-threatening situation.

800
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,520
 My mother was driving our car.

801
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,840
 It was a minivan to be exact.

802
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,280
 She was in a minivan phase.

803
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,080
 And so she had a minivan and there was me,

804
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,720
 my best friend was 14 years old,

805
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,720
 best friends in the car, little sister,

806
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,520
 and then little stepbrother and little stepsister

807
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
 who were very young.

808
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,120
 And we lived out in the woods in East Texas.

809
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,800
 And if you're not from East Texas,

810
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,200
 then you're picturing, oh, out in the woods.

811
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,020
 What does that mean?

812
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,860
 You know, a few trees?

813
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,420
 No, way woods, like dirt road.

814
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,280
 We lived way out there.

815
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,880
 And there was this little wooden bridge with no rails on it.

816
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,840
 There was a creek below it.

817
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,900
 And there was this little wooden bridge

818
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,260
 that we had to cross anytime we wanted to get in and out

819
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,100
 of the place we were living.

820
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,400
 We were 15 minutes from being in a small town.

821
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,000
 So you go to the small town and then you go out a long way.

822
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,440
 And then you go down the dirt road

823
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,940
 that they write horror stories about.

824
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,400
 And that is where we lived.

825
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,240
 And so you go down there

826
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,840
 and across this rickety wooden bridge every time.

827
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,260
 Well, it was a few days after Christmas

828
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,280
 when I was in eighth grade

829
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,840
 and it was obviously December and freezing

830
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,920
 and it was raining and we needed to get out

831
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,000
 to take my friend home.

832
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,340
 And we loaded up everybody into the car.

833
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,500
 And as we were going,

834
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,080
 we saw that the bridge was a little bit underwater,

835
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
 which is like, that's a little bit of a concern typically,

836
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,920
 but when you cross it every day,

837
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,940
 it kind of fills you with some confidence.

838
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,880
 And so we started to kind of cruise down towards it.

839
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,200
 And all of a sudden we went down towards it even farther

840
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,120
 and the headlights kind of flashed up

841
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,200
 where we could see that it was about a hundred yards

842
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,520
 or more that was underwater.

843
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,680
 And so it wasn't just the bridge right there.

844
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,760
 It was like the roads coming down to the bridge

845
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,040
 where all the creek had overflowed that far.

846
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,620
 And it was up, the water was up to the door handle.

847
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,660
 Okay, almost to the window where the window of the car is.

848
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,780
 And so that's where it was.

849
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,340
 So we noticed that all at the same time

850
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,740
 and mom immediately puts it into reverse

851
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,580
 and tries to get back.

852
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,340
 Well, we can't back up.

853
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,140
 It literally, you literally couldn't move.

854
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,780
 We got minivan tires on a mud, on a red mud road.

855
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,060
 It's not gonna work.

856
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,060
 And so she puts it in reverse, no can do.

857
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,340
 Puts it back into park, hoping it would at least stop.

858
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,940
 The mud is making a slide down towards the bridge.

859
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,700
 Okay, we need to get out of a window quickly.

860
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,140
 Just abandon the car.

861
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,760
 The electricity immediately goes out

862
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,180
 and the headlights are off, the doors are locked

863
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,080
 and the windows will not come down.

864
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,520
 That's where we all are.

865
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,260
 My mom starts shrieking.

866
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,440
 We're all terrified.

867
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
 I'm like, this is crazy right now.

868
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,840
 I don't know what to do.

869
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,040
 My friend is freaking out.

870
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,240
 He's kind of staring off into space

871
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,480
 and then water starts coming in the vehicle, freezing.

872
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,360
 All right, freezing cold.

873
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,300
 We all pick our feet up and we are stuck.

874
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,560
 And now listen, remember this.

875
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,600
 It's not like we're gonna float onto the bridge

876
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,000
 and the guardrails will keep us up.

877
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,100
 It's like, if we go off the bridge,

878
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,420
 we're gonna sink in that vehicle

879
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,820
 and that's gonna be the end of the end.

880
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
 And that's the situation we're in.

881
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,660
 And at that point, we start looking around for our options.

882
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,940
 Like, what are we gonna do?

883
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,140
 We got water coming in.

884
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,060
 If we open a door, it's just gonna all come in.

885
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,020
 So we can't do that.

886
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,900
 Can't open a window.

887
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,980
 We could try 911, no service.

888
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,060
 Should I just swing around

889
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,700
 and kick the window open with my legs?

890
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,140
 I mean, like, what do we do?

891
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,780
 And I don't know how other than the grace of God

892
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,940
 because there was no electricity in the vehicle whatsoever.

893
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,600
 But my mom's window, the driver window rolled down

894
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,400
 and the water was just at the level

895
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,720
 where when the window went down, water didn't come in.

896
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,800
 And she got out, hung on the door to find her footing,

897
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,560
 made sure there was ground underneath her.

898
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,400
 And we all went out.

899
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,840
 She squeezed in a call to 911.

900
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,980
 She got one bar of service to call 911.

901
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,240
 We got out, put the kids in our arms

902
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,400
 and we walked out slowly to higher ground.

903
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,240
 Slow, slow, slow.

904
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
 It was freezing.

905
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,720
 If you've ever seen the movie "Titanic,"

906
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
 you'll see it in a whole new light

907
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,080
 after you experience this one.

908
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,000
 It was completely freezing.

909
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,840
 And so when we just slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly

910
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,680
 started walking.

911
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,000
 And I have no idea what that situation is for you

912
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,200
 where you're like, hey, I'm out of good options.

913
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,320
 Okay, I got water outside.

914
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,760
 If I open the door, something bad happens.

915
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,120
 If I open the window, something bad happens.

916
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,480
 If I pick my feet up, something bad happens.

917
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,160
 If I leave, something bad happens.

918
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
 The water's freezing and we might drown anyway.

919
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
 I got nowhere to go.

920
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,280
 The water is rushing in, figuratively speaking,

921
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,120
 in my life.

922
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,420
 Like, what do I do, man?

923
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,240
 The answer is the window of opportunity

924
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,160
 for you to walk with God is still open.

925
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,960
 There might, I'm not saying there's no consequences

926
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,620
 for whatever has been going on in your life.

927
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,560
 I'm not saying it's gonna uncomplicate itself immediately.

928
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,760
 Whatever it is you're up against,

929
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,280
 I'm saying God's window of opportunity for you is open now

930
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,040
 and you can slowly start to put one foot in front of you

931
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,920
 of the other to walk with him.

932
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,080
 He will help you do it.

933
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,000
 Whatever you're stuck in,

934
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,660
 whatever your life was supposed to be about,

935
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,360
 but then now it's not and you're just stuck right there

936
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,020
 and then just, it feels like the situation's temperature

937
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,760
 is kind of rising and there's pressure

938
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,120
 and you don't know what to do with yourself,

939
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,220
 the answer is open your Bible

940
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,440
 and realize there is a good God behind it

941
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,240
 who's after you.

942
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,380
 He's opened a window for you to walk with him.

943
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,200
 It might not be fast.

944
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,160
 You might come out and show some marks,

945
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,080
 but it is better than staying where you are.

946
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,400
 And I don't know what you're up against.

947
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,160
 I'm telling you though, if you don't walk with God,

948
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
 it's gonna get worse.

949
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,920
 Some of you I know are in a situation where you're going,

950
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,320
 I'm pregnant and I don't wanna be a mom.

951
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,400
 I'm not ready.

952
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,220
 I can't pay.

953
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,060
 I can't provide.

954
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,000
 Why would I bring a kid into this situation?

955
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,880
 95% of the world says I should

956
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,840
 and so maybe I should just sit here and terminate.

957
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,720
 Walk with God one step at a time.

958
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,360
 No people will help you do that.

959
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,800
 There is always a window to get to him.

960
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,700
 He's present with you.

961
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,140
 I don't know what water's rushing in,

962
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,960
 creating pressure in your life right now.

963
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,520
 I know that there's a good God who's with you.

964
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,820
 He's got a plan for it.

965
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,480
 And there is a possibility right now

966
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
 that you could walk with him.

967
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,880
 And I promise you this, it is your best option.

968
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,260
 No matter how low it goes,

969
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,240
 no matter what the threats are against you,

970
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,320
 no matter what the consequences are for your own actions

971
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,360
 or the actions of others,

972
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,360
 your very best option is to get to higher ground

973
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,680
 one step at a time.

974
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,760
 Let's pray together.

975
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:17,960
 God, there's so much complexity in our lives

976
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,240
 that we have invited in or others have put in

977
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,440
 or just the broken world surprised us with.

978
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,920
 We have landed ourselves in more pits than we can count.

979
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,720
 We don't know what to do.

980
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,020
 We don't know our way out.

981
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,640
 Thank you, God, that you saw fit to provide a way out.

982
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,540
 That if we walk with you, we don't have to ignore wisdom

983
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,680
 and eat the fruit of our ways anymore, as Proverbs 2 says.

984
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,300
 We can walk with you and keep our way pure.

985
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,780
 We can experience something better.

986
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,080
 God, there is something better.

987
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,680
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

988
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

989
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

990
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

991
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

992
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

993
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

994
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

995
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

996
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

997
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

998
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

999
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

1000
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

1001
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

1002
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

1003
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

1004
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

1005
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,360
 You said you came to give us life and life abundant.

1006
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,360
