[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.280]   I'll be in Luke 10 tonight if you want to turn there.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.560]   I'll start by sharing with you one of my most private fantasies.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.080]   Everybody looked up.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.440]   That's funny.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.480]   I don't even know that I've ever said this before today, but I have found it to be incredibly
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.520]   true even in looking back.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.040]   So here it is.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.320]   I want to be Batman.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.440]   And you might be like, yeah, that's every guy or lots of people do, but I'm like looking
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.320]   back on my life and I realized like this is something that has marked me.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.440]   Like I've like bought stuff.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.880]   I'm coming, it's coming all out in the open right now.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.280]   Like I've like bought grappling hooks and samurai swords and, and like vehicles that
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.480]   can go off road just in case, you know?
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.800]   And I'm just thinking, I want to be a vigilante.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.240]   I want to be this person that is quick.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.600]   Like where does he get these wonderful toys that is able to move into any situation, you
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.040]   know, kind of lurk in the darkness and fight evil.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.800]   And this is something that it seriously resonates deep within me.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.160]   And there's this show that has become our favorite show that Monica and I watch.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.240]   In fact, we came home early from date night the other day because we're like, Hey, let's
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.560]   just go home and, and watch another episode.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.760]   And it's kind of Batman recreated.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.360]   It's about a guy who leaves this city.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.320]   He gets trained in all these martial arts and he gets all this equipment and returns
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.760]   to the city to fight evil and redeem the city and save the city.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.600]   I want to save the city with all of you.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.720]   We can be Batman, you know?
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.080]   And so this honestly, I mean, you could think about this.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   Okay.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.360]   I do think this is something that resonates with us.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.280]   I think this is why, you know, we get guys by guns and drive big trucks with big tires.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.760]   You ever, I mean, in Dallas, right?
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:16.960]   He's like, dude, wait, why you got a big truck just in case someone gets stuck at the Galleria.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.560]   I mean, come on, get stuck.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   Where?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560]   Six 35.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   I mean, what are we talking about?
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   Stuck in traffic.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   You know, it's like we do this.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560]   We're like, man, I just want to be ready.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.240]   It's why like Hummers, remember Hummers, everybody was buying Hummers before gas prices went way
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   up.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.840]   It's just like, there's something in us that's like, man, I just want something big and bad
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.800]   and just in case, you know?
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.560]   And uh, and so I was, this is how I was going to start the message exactly like this.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.480]   And I showed up this morning to staff prayer like I do any Tuesday and Todd Wagner, our
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   senior pastor begins staff prayers.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.760]   This is what we do every Tuesday.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.160]   Our staff prays for you guys and we gather and we pray and everything going on at watermark
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160]   and whatnot.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.920]   And, and uh, and he says, guys, this is how he starts that for guys today, you're going
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   to meet Batman.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.520]   And I was like, come on, he read my notes.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.880]   And so essentially it was Gary Haugen.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.880]   I don't know if you know who that is.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.080]   He's the president of international justice mission.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.920]   And so what Gary is responsible for setting more slaves free in 2014 than any other living
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   human being.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.080]   And so he works through attorneys, uh, to, uh, shut down brothels, both in the United
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.480]   States and overseas, all throughout Thailand and India and other places as well.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.200]   He goes and he works through their judicial system, staying and remaining within the laws
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.840]   to shut these down and to put pimps in prison and people, slave owners in prison.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   This is what he does.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.320]   And when we hear it, it resonates deep within us because you begin to get a glimpse of why
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.200]   you are alive.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.320]   You begin to have a picture of why God left you here after he saved you.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.760]   Slavery should not be sex trafficking should not be injustice should not be.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.400]   I will stop it.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.120]   I will be Batman like Gary and it, and it, while it resonates with us deeply, I believe
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.160]   we forget that the moment that someone kicks in the door, the brothel and sets the slaves
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.240]   free, there were thousands and thousands and thousands of hours behind the desk doing meaningless
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.960]   activity or what might feel like menial activity, rather timeless activity of working and studying
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.080]   and knowing what we need to do.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:41.640]   And everyone wants a heroic moment, but very few are willing to live a heroic mission.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.880]   And that is the call of the scripture, not that you would live for one heroic moment
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.080]   that you would, you know, get this opportunity where someone bows up around you or you see
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.360]   someone hit his girlfriend and you go and you like, yeah, you know, but that you would
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:07.160]   live a heroic mission every day of your life for the name and the glory of Jesus Christ,
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.880]   the one who died for you.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.560]   This is the call of the believer.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.600]   Somebody asked Mr. Hogan a question and just said, Hey, you know, sex trafficking is kind
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.560]   of the cool thing.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   Everybody wants to get involved.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.120]   And he said, well, let me describe it to you.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.400]   You can tell me if fighting it sounds cool to you.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.120]   Can you imagine driving four hours in a vehicle to a, to another town, I think Houston or
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:41.240]   Lubbock and waiting in the DMV line for hours and doing that 60 times so many hours.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.720]   In fact, in this one particular case represented 6,000 hours waiting on a judge in a courtroom,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   6,000 hours.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.680]   You weren't even in high school, 6,000 hours so that these slaves could be set free.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.160]   He goes, does that sound cool and fun and exciting and sexy?
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.200]   He said, because that's what we do.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.000]   You read in the headlines when we kicked down the doors, but you don't realize all the work
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.240]   that went into training Batman and equipping Batman.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.280]   And if you're here and you have the Holy spirit, you have been equipped and trained to do such
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.200]   a thing as these for moments such as this, that we exist in very particular moments in
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.640]   the history of the world that God has kept you here to live and exist in that you would
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:40.480]   find your mission to fight evil, to be a vigilante of good.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.520]   There are vigilantes in this room right now whom I know personally by day, they are civil
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.800]   engineers and consultants and school teachers, but when they're off, they are fighting evil
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.920]   in our city strategically and they're winning.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.400]   They are experiencing victory in a way that you're naive to unaware of.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:11.560]   They are setting sex slaves free, shutting down crack houses, putting drug Lords in prison
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.520]   in Dallas and in Fort worth.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.320]   If you're tuning in around the country or in Houston or in Fort worth, we're talking
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.800]   about our city tonight.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.600]   I want you to hear your city because we need lights shining in darkness in your city as
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.480]   well, just as I will call us in our city to shine in the darkness.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.420]   And so we're talking about today, saving our city in a series called unashamed.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.920]   This is week number two.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.080]   Unashamed is based on a scripture in acts chapter one, verse eight, where it says this,
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   I'll read it to you.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.840]   It says, but you will receive power when the Holy spirit comes on you.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.200]   This is Jesus talking to the disciples before he ascends to go and be with God.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.920]   And so his last words to the disciples, this is the great commandment as it is found in
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.520]   the book of acts, but you will receive power when the Holy spirit comes on you and you
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.920]   will be my witnesses.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.960]   It's the same word for martyrs.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:12.120]   You will die for this mission in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   of the earth.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.260]   And we take in that last section and broke it up into three weeks.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.020]   Last week we talked about Jerusalem.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.120]   That is the places that you go every day.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.240]   That is your Starbucks.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.760]   That is your grocery store.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.800]   That is your school and your job.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.760]   That is the path that you drive all the time that you would shine there, that you would
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.880]   be a light wherever you are.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.200]   Today we're talking about Judea and Samaria.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.980]   Samaria is a place that as Jesus's disciples would hear this, they would say, we don't
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.620]   even go there.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:43.840]   Even though that's our area, an area, the size of relatively DFW, those are places we
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.280]   don't go to.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.780]   He's saying, I'm calling you to go to those places now that you would intentionally and
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:09:02.200]   strategically be a light in dark places are Judea and Samaria places in DFW.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:11.920]   Gary said this morning that a match, if struck, it's hard to see in a lit room, but it shines
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.240]   the brightest in darkness.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   Wherever there is light, darkness cannot coexist with it.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.760]   If you will go intentionally to dark places and shine a light there, you will make a difference.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:32.960]   If we do it together, you will, we will, God through us will change the world.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.480]   Change the world.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.360]   This evening we're going to talk about who is our neighbor.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.520]   I'm going to give us several excuses that we use, essentially asking the question, what
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.840]   keeps us from being a neighbor?
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.040]   And then before you leave here this evening, how will we love our neighbors?
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.800]   I told you we would be in Luke 10.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.480]   I'm going to start in verse 25, but to set this text up, I want you to know that Jesus,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.800]   he gathers the 12 during his ministry and he sends them out and he tells them, pray
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.120]   to the God of the harvest for the harvest is plenty, but the workers are few and the
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   12 come back.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.840]   And then he sends out what we know of as the 72.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.560]   We see this in Luke chapter 10 and he told them in Luke chapter 10, verse two, the harvest
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.320]   is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.200]   Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore to send out workers into his harvest field.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:34.180]   Go, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves, which would be terrifying unless we
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.820]   had the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:43.540]   So Jesus sends out the 12, then he sends out the 72 and tonight, 2014, he's going to send
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.540]   out the 2,500.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:53.420]   I pray to God that he does, that you catch a vision of what a life on mission looks like.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:11:00.460]   Everyone wants a heroic moment, but very few live a heroic mission.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:06.980]   I pray that you would.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.020]   Verse 25, on one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus teacher.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.800]   He asked, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.940]   We see this question throughout the scriptures.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.940]   The same thing.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.780]   The rich young ruler asked Jesus, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.740]   It's the same question you're asking Jesus, or you've asked Jesus at some point, what
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.500]   must I do to get into heaven?
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.020]   What must I do to be with you forever?
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.460]   Jesus, what do I got to do to get my reward at the end of this life?
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.300]   Now when you hear an expert in the law, do not think lawyer.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.540]   Remember, they were in a theocracy, the Jews were.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.380]   And so this is a person, an expert in Mosaic law, essentially an expert in the Bible.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.180]   This is an Old Testament scholar that is quizzing Jesus.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.680]   And it says that his motive is not to sincerely know what must I do to inherit eternal life.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.820]   His motive is to test Jesus.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.620]   That's why he's asking this question.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.960]   Jesus, of course, being God, knows this.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.740]   And he says this, what is written in the law?
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.260]   He replied, Jesus replied, how do you read it?
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.660]   Now Jesus would often answer questions in one of two ways, with a question or with a
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.060]   story.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.740]   In this passage, he's going to do both.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.580]   Here he answers with a question.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.580]   What is written in the law?
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.820]   How do you read it?
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.500]   How do you read it was a question that rabbis were known to ask.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.380]   How do you read it?
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.420]   How do you interpret that law?
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.420]   This is an expert in the law.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.140]   Jesus says, how do you read it?
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.900]   He answered, love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:36.980]   all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.140]   This is the great commandment.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.580]   Earlier we looked at the great commission.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.940]   This is the great commandment.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.900]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and love your neighbor
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.900]   as yourself.
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.420]   Jesus said this.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.420]   This is also in the law.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.180]   If you don't know, Deuteronomy six says, love your, love the Lord your God with all your
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.180]   heart, soul, mind and strength.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.980]   And then Leviticus 19 verse 18 says, love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.980]   And Jesus said all of the law on the, of the prophets, which were 613 in number, Jesus
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.820]   being an amazing teacher, an expert on the law himself said all 613 of those laws can
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.040]   be summarized in these two.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.520]   If you would just do these two.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.780]   And so this guy answers with these two and Jesus says, you have answered correctly.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.860]   Do this and you will live, which is interesting.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.420]   I mean, Jesus just said, Hey, if you do this, you'll inherit eternal life.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.420]   And we'd be like, wait a minute.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.420]   You got to trust in Jesus.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   His death and resurrection.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.580]   That hadn't happened yet.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.500]   But also keep in mind that no one who can do that, who can love the Lord, their God
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.000]   with other hearts, soul, mind and strength and their neighbors themselves without the
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.700]   help of the Holy spirit, who can do that.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.660]   But it says he wanted to justify himself.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.580]   So he asked Jesus and who is my neighbor?
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.580]   Here's what's going on there.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.580]   There's this expert in the law.
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.340]   He's there among his friends to the Jewish people or specifically to an expert in the
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.020]   law, his neighbors would have been maybe what you think of when you think of neighbor, those
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.140]   right beside him, the people who live next door.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.580]   And so he says, the text says he wants to justify himself.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.580]   This is what's happening.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.740]   He's like, Hey Jacob, tell him how I mowed your lawn the other day.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.740]   Tell him.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.740]   I want to listen.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.740]   Okay.
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.740]   Jesus, tell him who my neighbor is.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.940]   Show them how I've done this so well.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.420]   Maybe you're thinking that you're like, Oh man, you know, I did my roommate's dishes
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.020]   the other night, you know, even though they left them out, like they always do and they
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.820]   never take out the trash, but I took it out.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.820]   This is what I did.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.460]   Jesus justify me.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.140]   Show them how I've loved my neighbor.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.620]   He says, who is my neighbor?
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.780]   And replied, Jesus now answers with a story.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.620]   A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.860]   They stripped him of his clothes.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.620]   They beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:49.180]   The road from Jerusalem to Jericho was 17 miles and it descends 3000 feet.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.700]   So when it says he was going down, he was literally going down.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.900]   This was a well-known road.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.900]   It was full of robbers that was known.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.940]   History shows us this just to show you how smart Jesus is, how, what a great teacher
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.860]   is and how this fits in history.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:07.500]   Josephus, a historian from this time writes about this very same road.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.500]   In fact, he talks about how Herod, King Herod had fired 40 of his employees and they went
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.300]   to be all 40 of them went to be robbers on this road.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.420]   That this road was called the path of blood by some that many went here to die or to be
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.820]   bit beaten or robbed.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.780]   It would have been foolish to be on this road, not on a donkey or riding something.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.220]   And so Jesus is telling a story.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.220]   It's a real story.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.820]   I mean, it's a story that he's making up, but he sets it in their, their scene and their
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.060]   circumstance.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.460]   A priest happened to be going down the same road.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.460]   And when he saw the man, certainly he helps him, right?
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.980]   Because he's a priest and that's what priests do.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.020]   No, he passed by on the other side.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.020]   Okay.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.060]   Now the priest is someone who the expert in the law would have resonated with, right?
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.060]   That would have been his hero.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.060]   Oh, a priest.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.060]   Okay, great.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.060]   So a priest isn't what he does.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.060]   What?
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.060]   Okay.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.100]   So to a Levite.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.820]   Now a Levite was a descendant from the tribe of Levi, but not of Aaron.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.300]   So a priest would have been from the descendant of Aaron.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.540]   A Levite would have been someone who helps the priest.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.580]   Okay.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.420]   So think pastor and youth minister or something.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.420]   Right.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:19.580]   And so a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side, but
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.900]   a Samaritan as he traveled came where the man was.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.640]   And when he saw him, he took pity on him.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.060]   He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:37.500]   Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.900]   The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.580]   Look after him, he said.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.060]   And when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.300]   The story just got crazy scandalous.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.900]   There's a thousand years of racism going on here for this man.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.620]   The expert in the law would have hated a Samaritan.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:06.340]   Jews at this time would go a day's travel out of the way to avoid any Samaritan village.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:12.300]   Samaritans to them represented a time of sin, a time of that their people had mixed racially
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.060]   with people that they weren't supposed to interact with racially.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.320]   And so the Samaritans were the offspring of this.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.280]   They would have considered them half breeds.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.420]   There was serious, serious racism going on.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.600]   And so Jesus doesn't just put the Samaritan in the story.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.380]   He makes him the hero.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.460]   Now you've got to feel this, okay, to understand what's going on.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.700]   You have a prejudice.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.700]   Everyone here has a prejudice.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.940]   I don't know what it is.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.860]   That's the crazy thing about our prejudices that we're blind to them.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.940]   We can't see them.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.740]   And so who is it in the story for you?
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.300]   Who is it maybe for you?
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.860]   Jesus is telling the story and he's like, well, there's this pastor walks by and then
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:58.620]   there was this youth minister walks by and then there was a Muslim who came to this man
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:04.820]   and he took off his turban and he used it to bandage his wounds.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.460]   Maybe your racism or your prejudice is it was a gay man.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:20.380]   Gay man came up, homosexual guy came up and cared for this hurt guy.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:27.220]   Maybe as a Baptist, maybe as a Catholic, maybe as an Aggie.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.020]   Hey, don't go there.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.500]   Right?
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.260]   What is your prejudice?
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.760]   What are you prejudiced towards?
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   Who would it be?
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   I want you to put them in.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.740]   Maybe it's a Democrat.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.780]   Maybe it's a Republican.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.780]   Maybe it's Obama.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.000]   Obama comes and man, you're like, what?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   He would never.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Maybe, right?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.060]   I'm saying that's on you.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.300]   I'm just saying hypothetically.
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.060]   Maybe you're like, it's a telemarketer.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.060]   I don't know.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.060]   Who are you prejudiced towards?
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:08.620]   Jesus puts that person in the story.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:15.140]   He has your attention and he says, this one was more righteous than you.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.240]   This one understands my commands.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:26.700]   This one is more of a Christian than you ever thought you were.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.540]   Jesus asked the question, which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.520]   fell into the hands of robbers and the expert in the law replied, the one who had mercy
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   on him.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.140]   He couldn't even say Samaritan.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:44.240]   He just says the one who had mercy on him and Jesus says, go and do likewise.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:52.960]   He's calling us to show mercy to those that can do nothing for us in return.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.300]   And so my first point, the first question rather I want to ask from this text is who
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.900]   is our neighbor?
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.300]   Who is our neighbor here in Dallas and in Fort Worth?
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.300]   Who is your neighbor?
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.680]   And it says that our neighbor is anyone in need around us.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.980]   Anyone who has need around us, regardless of race, religion, background, or social status,
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.980]   think someone not like you, maybe someone that you're very unlikely to go up to and
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:16.980]   help.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.980]   Maybe someone you're very intimidated by or someone you think you can't understand.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.680]   And that is your neighbor.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.860]   If they have need around you and you cannot miss this basic teaching of the Christian
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.860]   faith.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.980]   You come here, then you say, I'm a Jesus follower.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.860]   I'm a Christ follower.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.100]   But you've missed this thing.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.140]   You've missed it.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.060]   You've missed something very key to the scripture.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.820]   So what do you think of when you think of your city?
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:55.800]   When I think of Dallas, I think of pretentious, pretty, uptown, entrepreneurship.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   What do you think of?
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.060]   What would you write down when you think of Dallas?
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.220]   What would you write down?
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.220]   What would you list out?
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.220]   I think of business.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.220]   I think of money.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.980]   I think of nice cars and buildings.
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:14.540]   I think of clean and contemporary.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:20.500]   But I love comics, particularly comics of vigilantes that display vigilantes because
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.140]   they often show the two tails of one city.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.820]   They show the poor and the very rich and how they're connected by a bridge of crime and
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.500]   sex and drugs.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   And our city is no different.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.500]   Our city has two sides.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.820]   In fact, I'll tell you one, some statistics of an area less than five miles away, an area
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.940]   that when you travel to Fort Worth, you drive through.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:49.300]   Our brothers and sisters in West Dallas, these come from the 2010 US Census Bureau, 67% of
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.660]   children born there are born to single moms.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.060]   That's the vast majority born to single moms.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.740]   This is in your city.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.860]   The average per capita income is $9,183.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:06.580]   37% of families are living below poverty level.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.220]   70% of the adult population has less than a high school education.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:17.700]   I need you to care about that, particularly if you're a teacher or you can read well because
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.780]   you can make a difference.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.120]   You can be the solution.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.580]   Only 2% of the population has a college degree, only 2%.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.220]   60% of the population have no health insurance of any kind.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.660]   Now let's just talk about Dallas in general because we're here.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.460]   That is all about West Dallas.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.140]   This comes from the Dallas Task Force 2012 study.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.020]   This is your city.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.220]   We are the nation's worst child.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.900]   We have the nation's worst child poverty rate.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.100]   I did say worst, not one of the worst, not among the worst.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.260]   We have the worst child poverty rate in America.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.960]   We're the second largest in growth of overall poverty rate from 2000.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:58.560]   We're the third worst overall poverty rate at 24%, but our poverty rate grew by 41%.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.680]   It is a growing problem.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.660]   It's getting worse here in our city.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.160]   And this is a quote, "The poverty level in the Dallas Independent School District is
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.800]   one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   and Detroit.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.260]   In the last 12 years, the Dallas population has increased by 5% in the same amount of
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:22.500]   time those living in Dallas and poverty has increased 41%."
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.580]   Crime is absolutely on the rise in your city.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.820]   94% of American cities are safer than Dallas.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.420]   And this was in the Dallas Morning News yesterday.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   Are you ready?
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:37.020]   Dallas County is the deadliest place for a woman in Texas last year.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:43.660]   The new report says, "Dallas County is the single deadliest place in our country for
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.140]   a woman to live."
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.780]   We have a $99 million sex trafficking industry right here among us.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.980]   In fact, there is a brothel half a mile away that we are completely oblivious to as we
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.660]   sit in this room and we read from the scriptures from a man who tells us to go and care for
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:05.020]   the least of these.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.540]   Fort Worth, I wish I had a better story for you.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.780]   There's lots of grim stats, particularly in the past 12 months.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.820]   Oppression for you is up 12%.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.260]   Homelessness is up 60%.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.140]   That comes from the Star-Telegram and CBS.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.980]   Crime is on the rise in Fort Worth.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.420]   Violent sex acts are on the rise in your city.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.740]   And one of the most impoverished areas in DFW is right across the street from where
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:36.540]   you are right now.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:43.660]   And I know that you'll go to these areas when it's cool to do so, when it's hip and trendy
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.860]   to do so.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.300]   You go to Bishop Hearts or Trinity Grove and call it a mission trip.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.260]   It's there on mission.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.020]   Eating food, having fun on mission.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.820]   Go to the Fairmount, wherever that is for you.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:05.460]   But all we're doing is we're taking less people that we might consider less fortunate than
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.820]   us and we're just moving them.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.900]   We're just going there and we're raising real estate prices and they have nowhere else to
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   go.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.180]   They just kind of continue to shift around.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.340]   It's a shell game.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.380]   We're not actually solving the problem.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.380]   It's called gentrification.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.620]   If that's a word that's new to you, look it up later, Google it or something, but it's
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.300]   something that you need to know.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.020]   We're not actually helping them.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:32.460]   We're hurting them by mobilizing wealthy into those areas, not caring for them, not meeting
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.460]   where they're at.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.300]   We're waiting until they're hip and trendy and then we'll move there.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.820]   But you might need to move there right now.
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.860]   But that's unsafe.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.980]   The gospel's unsafe.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.020]   You know those 12 guys, they all died, right?
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.740]   You know, not of old age.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.420]   Not of natural causes.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:01.220]   They were murdered.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.060]   Seven of them were murdered.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   These are examples.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.180]   This is how we know the gospel.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.420]   And so what prevents us from being a neighbor to those in need?
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:18.060]   My second question from this text, what prevents us from being a neighbor to those in need?
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:25.420]   I believe that when you see the hurting, every human being has an impulse reaction, an instinct
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.500]   that responds to the hurting, depending where you are on a spiritual chart, where you are
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.260]   with God or where you are, maybe you're an atheist, and where you are with morality.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.780]   You respond in one of three ways.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.060]   The first one is to hurt them, okay?
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.660]   And you say, "Well, who responds this way?"
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.340]   People do indeed, to take advantage of those.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.780]   You do so usury.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.780]   And some of you guys are like, "I would never do that."
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.300]   You do every single time you've looked at porn.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:58.340]   You're taking advantage of someone in a situation we might consider unfortunate.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.380]   Someone that grew up in a parentless home or someone that grew up with resources that
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.780]   you do not have available to you, you are exploiting them.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:13.500]   You are part of the sex trafficking problem when you go to a strip club, okay?
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.740]   And so one impulse would be to hurt, to take advantage of that situation for your own personal
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.740]   benefit.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.220]   Another one would be to help.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.420]   I see someone in need.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.700]   I want to be a good Samaritan.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.060]   I will be mobilized to them to understand their need, to identify their need, and to
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.580]   meet their need.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.180]   And the third one is to ignore it.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.620]   All three of those responses are represented in the room tonight.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.740]   There are those of you that when you see an opportunity, you're opportunistic, you want
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.300]   to take advantage of it.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.860]   You want to see how you can get it to benefit yourself, how you can make money or profit
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.420]   from it, how you can find pleasure in it.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.540]   You want to hurt them.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.020]   Or those of you move to compassion and you say, "Well, when I see someone in need, I
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.020]   want to help them.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.020]   I want to render aid.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.140]   I want to go to where there is need and help."
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:10.580]   And so many of us in the room say, "JP, just let me get back to my normal life in my city.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.580]   Let me just respond.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.980]   Let me just be naive to this stuff.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.700]   I don't want to hear there's a brothel half a mile away.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.580]   I might have to do something about that.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.980]   Don't tell me these statistics.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.300]   JP, I'm numb to statistics.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:28.580]   You just read a bunch of percentages my heart had no response to because I have been ignoring
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.940]   it for so long.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.620]   I don't care that people can't read.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.140]   I don't care that people are poor.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.660]   I don't care that people are hungry.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.300]   I don't care that girls in my city are being raped for sport.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.300]   I don't care.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:47.300]   I just want to sit comfortably on my couch and watch my TV and make my money and drive
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.260]   my car and go to the party.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.100]   Why are you trying to interrupt that?"
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.100]   I'm not.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:59.180]   The Holy Spirit is.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.860]   And so why don't we help those in need?
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.420]   Because one, we're too busy.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.780]   It's inconvenient.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.980]   It doesn't fit in our agenda.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.980]   It takes time.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.580]   And to be a good neighbor, we must make margin to be a good neighbor.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.540]   Some of you, to make margin sounds like an impossible, daunting task.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.540]   How do I make margin?
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.020]   How do I create time?
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.420]   You have to follow Jesus as you're following Christ.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.780]   I'm not saying to get into heaven.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:34.340]   But to follow Jesus, you have to create margin to care for those in need.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:39.340]   Secondly, I believe that we focus too much on orthodoxy rather than orthopraxy.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.420]   Two big words, let me define them.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.140]   Orthodoxy, ortho just means right.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.460]   Doxy means belief.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.540]   Ortho means correct or right.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.300]   Doxy means belief, or we get the word doctrine.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.540]   And so the orthodoxy, that's the head knowledge.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.020]   And so to be a Christian, it is lived out.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.160]   We live out knowledge.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.180]   We always respond and act according to our belief that you're orthopraxy, right practice
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.020]   or right action.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.500]   And so this man, this expert in the law, he had a high orthodoxy.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.580]   Do not forget that he won the question.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.260]   I mean, he won the sword drill.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.500]   He won the quiz, if you will.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.580]   Jesus said, how do you read it?
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.820]   He responds, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.820]   Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.260]   Jesus says, correct, ding, ding, ding.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.980]   You've got it right.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.260]   You know a lot of Bible.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.620]   You've got some memory verses.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.380]   You study the scriptures.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.060]   And all of this head knowledge has missed your heart because you do not respond to it.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.900]   Your heart has been calloused.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:41.420]   You've been a Christian so long that you forgot what it means to be a Christian.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.500]   You've been taking in information and not doing anything with it.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.220]   We have an orthodoxy, but we do not have an orthopraxy.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.120]   We do not live it out.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.780]   You even heard those words before.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.860]   You even heard the sermon before.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.860]   In your heart, you're rolling your eyes like, I know what those words, orthodoxy, orthopraxy.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:03.460]   You've got to wake up.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.980]   The priest and the Levite, keep in mind, they're coming back from Jerusalem because they've
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.260]   been in the temple.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.460]   Do you know that it would have been against their religious duty to help a bloody man
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.880]   who would have been unclean?
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   They couldn't.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.780]   Their religion wouldn't allow them to, which is so convicting to me because I remember
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:29.100]   a day that so much of my life was geared toward serving the poor and the widow and the orphan.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:34.460]   It seemed like every time I turned around, I was going on an international trip or just
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.460]   traveling around here.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.460]   And now I've gotten religious.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.380]   Now I've always got to study the Bible to teach the Bible.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.500]   And the orthodoxy is growing.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:51.380]   The orthopraxy is being hurt in my own life.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:58.060]   But God says this is the religion he wants, James 1, verse 27.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:03.020]   Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless as this to look after orphans
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:10.620]   and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.500]   Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless as this to look after orphans
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:21.820]   and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.660]   Why don't we do this?
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.460]   Thirdly, because we are focused on our comfort, not compassion.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.940]   We are focused on our comfort like compassion.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.940]   We're just like the priest.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.940]   We're like the Levite.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.900]   We don't want to get dirty because make no mistake about it, if you pick up a bloody
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.260]   man who has been stripped of his clothes, you're going to get dirty.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.420]   Make no mistake about it.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.940]   It takes time and effort to love people who are different than you.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.980]   And you might get messy.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.500]   You might get dirty as you enter into their lives and as you get to know them and as you
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:58.260]   build a relationship from a pure heart, it might cost you something.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:07.820]   And we'd rather have comfort than display or be given to compassion.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.380]   I'll give you a real example of this.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:15.540]   Just occurred, you know, when Ebola came to Dallas, it was just like mad, madness.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.720]   Like people were worried and anxious and am I going to get it?
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.340]   And this is very ironic to me for a number of reasons.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.340]   But do you understand that in the first century church that Christians would have heard that
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.980]   Ebola came to their city and they would have moved towards that?
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.660]   They'd have been like, where?
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.820]   We've got to go render aid.
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.820]   That's what we're here for.
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.260]   That's why we live.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.920]   We've got to go help out.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.340]   And you say, but they would get it and they would die.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.140]   And they would say, exactly.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.140]   Don't you know?
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.500]   That's how Christianity blew up in the first, second and third centuries, right?
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.600]   Christians were loving those that had been hit by a plague that was killing them.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.240]   Up in Rome, 5,000 daily dying and everyone left and their families left and everyone
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:03.000]   who loved them left and Christians moved in so that they would exchange their health for
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   that person's comfort as they died.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.780]   And we hear it and it's moving, but we don't want it for ourselves.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.320]   And the world asks, who loves like this?
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:17.040]   And they say, Jesus, Jesus.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.620]   Don't you know the gospel?
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:27.960]   That he loved me so much that he died for me so that I might live.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.620]   And so I'm just a little Jesus in the first, second, third, fourth century.
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.140]   Christians live this out.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.860]   We'll just be little Christ.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.060]   And it's somehow in the comfort of Dallas.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.460]   The DFW, we've forgotten that.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.460]   And we hear Ebola and we're on Google and reading articles and can you catch it?
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.500]   Can it spread through the air?
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.380]   Should I wear a SARS mask or something?
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.380]   What do I need to do?
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.380]   I'm terrified.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:04.180]   You know what it means to be a superhero.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.920]   Like everyone in Acts 1, 8, when the power of the Holy Spirit comes to you, you know
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.380]   that you've got this superpower, it's the greatest superpower known to man, you became
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.380]   immortal.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.140]   You know that?
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.600]   That anybody here who's trusted in Christ in the room, you don't die, you live forever
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.180]   and ever and ever, that's kind of what we believe.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.620]   Like the greatest day that you will ever live will be the day that you go to live and be
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.700]   with the Lord forever and ever and ever.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.980]   It only gets better for you, believer.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.420]   You know that, right?
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.260]   Like you get up there and you're like, he's like, "What happened?"
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.260]   Caught Ebola.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.260]   "Oh, you're so stupid.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.660]   How, you know, didn't you wear the mask?"
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:57.880]   You know?
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.700]   This is why, I don't know if you know this or realize this or have thought about it,
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.180]   this is why hospitals have church's names on the top of them.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.860]   This is why you go to St. Jude's or Presbyterian Hospital or United Methodist Hospital, you
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.700]   know, all of these names are tied back to the scripture or some denomination.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.820]   This is why, because hospitals were born out of Christian movements.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.500]   It was Christians who were loving sick people.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.780]   They were going and moving toward them and saying, "Hey, how can I care for you in time
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.780]   of need?"
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.100]   And then these institutions were built and then hospitals exist and you drive through
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.900]   Dallas or Fort Worth or Houston or wherever you're at and you look at these hospitals
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.300]   and they have some church's name on the top of them.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.300]   Why?
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:39.740]   Because they were founded by churches because it's churches who care for the sick.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.940]   Like some of you, you're hearing that for the first time, your mind's kind of blown,
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.620]   you're like, "Well, I never had thought about that."
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.660]   It's us, we're the one setting the pace.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:58.820]   And it's going to be, and you've got to hear me, it's going to be lost in your generation.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:04.020]   It's going to be lost in your generation as you seek comfort over compassion.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:09.260]   This will be gone in millennials and Gen Y because, man, we're all about having fun and
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.860]   a good time and tolerance and, man, how can we just raise the bar on freedom and doing
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.860]   what we want to do?
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:22.800]   Meanwhile, people in your city are dying and you're so Christian you forgot what it means
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:29.660]   to be Christian.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.660]   I'm not unashamed.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.660]   I'm ashamed.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.660]   What happened to us?
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:42.320]   What's going on in our generation, guys?
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.340]   I asked Todd, I was with him the day and I just said, "Man, how do you think this,"
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.700]   because I've seen your pastor here if you don't know who that is, "How do you think
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.700]   this goes?
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   Like, do you think we wake up?
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.780]   You think revival happens?
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.960]   You think an awakening happens?
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.680]   You think our hearts return back to God or do you think this is Him removing His hand
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.060]   from us and we fall off?"
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:05.860]   And the world that our, the America that our children grow up in is a very different America,
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:06.860]   very dark, dark America.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:11.300]   He said, "It depends on how you preach tonight."
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:19.300]   Here's what he's saying.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.500]   "It depends on how you respond.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.660]   It depends on what you do with it.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:35.940]   Do not lose our country, guys, out of convenience and comfort, forgetting your missions, forsaking
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.940]   your mission."
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:53.460]   The third question from this text is, "How can we be good neighbors?"
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.100]   How can we be good neighbors?
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.020]   The expert asked, "Who are my neighbors?"
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.860]   And Jesus responds with a very different answer.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.100]   He says, "This is what it looks like to be a good neighbor."
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.740]   The guy asked, "Who are my neighbors?"
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.540]   Jesus says, "Hey, if you do this, then you are a neighbor."
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.220]   And He's saying, as He's displaying through the Good Samaritan, that it starts with compassion.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.820]   This word in the Greek is a unique word.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.680]   It only shows up a couple times in the New Testament.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.940]   And it's a strange word.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.940]   It's hard to explain.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.060]   It has in it your bowels because they believe that this is something that happened from
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.060]   deep within you.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.660]   It essentially is saying when the Good Samaritan saw Him, He was kicked in the gut.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.340]   He was stopped in His tracks.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:38.580]   It's the same word that we see when the prodigal son comes home and the father has compassion
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:43.500]   on him and he runs out to him and he restores him back to his inheritance.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.420]   It's the same word.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.340]   He says he's moved with compassion.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.580]   It starts simply by us actually caring.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:58.020]   We talked last week about engaging and sharing and inviting.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.440]   And it's the same this week, that you would engage with someone, that you would care to
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.900]   know them, that you would share truth in trying to assess their need, and then you would invite
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.700]   them to where their need can be found.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.700]   Or met, rather.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.700]   Where their need can be met.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.820]   Let me explain what I mean by assess their need because this is important.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.740]   Before you leave here, you have to get this.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:25.240]   When I say assess their need, what their stated need is might not be their actual need.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.600]   Like when a guy says, "Hey, I need a dollar," that may be the very worst thing for him.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.960]   And to find out what is the best thing for him is going to take a relational interaction.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.360]   It's going to take time and effort and sincere compassion and actually caring.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.880]   The very easiest thing for you to do might be to hand a dollar.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.160]   Let me explain.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.040]   When you go to the doctor and you say, "My leg hurts," the doctor doesn't just put a
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.120]   cast on it.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.360]   The doctor says, "Hey, does this hurt?"
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.520]   He pokes and prods and you may have a torn muscle, you may have a pulled muscle, it may
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.080]   be something else that a cast wouldn't heal.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.400]   And so you don't just go, "Hey, my leg hurts.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   Okay, let's put a cast on it."
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.280]   You say, "Hey, let's assess the problem.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.520]   Let's find out what's really going on."
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.720]   And so when you're talking to someone and you say, "Hey, what's going on, man?
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   I'm just looking for money."
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   "Cool, what are you looking for money for?"
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   "Well, I'm hungry."
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   "Cool, can I buy you food?"
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   "No, I don't want food."
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   "Okay, let me understand.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   You're looking for money for food, but you don't want me to buy you food?"
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.720]   "No."
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   "Okay, that doesn't add up.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.720]   Let's talk.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   Hey, do you know Christ?"
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.680]   "Yeah, yeah, man, I know him.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   Let me tell you.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   You know, this is what I know."
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.920]   And you're engaged in these conversations.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.160]   Let's talk about it.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.200]   When I first understood this, I made it a goal to, or I used to, when people would come
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.960]   up to me as a non-believer, it would always be, "Hey, sorry, dude, only got credit cards.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   Only credit cards."
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.440]   Then I realized I was lying as I became a believer.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.960]   I'm like, "Okay, that's probably not good.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   I shouldn't lie."
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.440]   And so then I'd make it a game to engage first.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.760]   Whenever I saw someone kind of doing it at the gas station, going from car to car, you
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.200]   know, I would just engage, "Hey, bro, come here.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.200]   Hey, come on.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   Hey, what are you doing, man?
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   Talk to me, man.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   I'm pumping gas.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   I want to hear your story.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   I saw you talking to people, man.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   What do you need?
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   What's going on?
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   You know, let's talk about it."
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.360]   As soon as I committed to doing this, like right after I committed to doing this, I bumped
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.720]   up against one gentleman, or he was at a gas station kind of going from car to car.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.560]   I yelled across the parking lot, "Hey, come talk to me.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.920]   Hey, man, listen, come and talk to me.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   Hey, man, are you hungry?
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   Can I help you?
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   You want something?
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   Let me buy you some food."
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   "No, dude, I'm not hungry.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   I'm full.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   I just ate."
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.220]   I'm like, "Cool, didn't see that coming, but all right.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.220]   What else is going on?"
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.640]   And he begins to share with me, and I say, "Let me ask you a question, bro.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.960]   Hey, do you know that God loves you so much?"
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.960]   He says, "Yeah."
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.360]   Hebrews 13, 2, and he walks off.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.880]   And I'm like, "What is Hebrews 13, 2?"
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.200]   I'll read it to you.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:50.640]   "Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing so, some people have shown hospitality
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.960]   to angels without knowing it."
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   I don't know, man.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   Dude said, "Hebrews 13, 2," and then he disappeared.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:57.960]   No, he didn't.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   I'm just playing.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   He didn't disappear.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:06.680]   I'm just kidding.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.640]   Find people who can do nothing for them, for us, rather, and we assess their need, and
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   we meet that need.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.280]   Hey, guys, does this sound familiar?
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.000]   Is this not what Jesus Christ did for you?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.880]   If you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ, at some point, you were flat on your
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.320]   back, you realized you could do nothing for your own salvation, and you understood that
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.920]   someone in spite of you died on your behalf, that they paid your eternal price in your
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.920]   place.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.760]   This was Jesus Christ.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:38.080]   This is love, that when you could do nothing for him in return, he took you, and he cleaned
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.160]   you up, and he loved you, and he cared for you so much that he endured every piece of
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.320]   pornography you looked at, every dude you slept with, everything that you've done wrong,
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.440]   every time you've been drunk, every curse word you've said, every movie you've seen
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:57.880]   that you shouldn't have, every concert you've gone to, and he died for it to set you free
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.880]   so that you could be with God forever.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.880]   It is the gospel.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.380]   It's 1 John 3, verse 16 and 17, says this.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.440]   This is how we know what love is.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.840]   Jesus Christ laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.960]   and sisters.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:15.600]   If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.680]   on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.880]   I'm asking you now, what if contemporary Christianity is not what Jesus had in mind at all?
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.480]   That we would go to these places and enjoy fun and fellowship, and then we'd go home
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.040]   and live our lives, and then we'd go back and enjoy fun and fellowship, and we'd be
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.240]   like, "Is the speaker good?
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   Is the worship good?
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   Are the seats comfortable?
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.480]   Do they have coffee?"
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.360]   What if that's just not what Jesus had in mind?
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.720]   I don't think it is, by the way.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.240]   I've kind of spent some time reading this book, and I think he had something really,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.460]   really different in mind.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:58.640]   He never wanted to create an audience but an army.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.920]   At the porch, we are not an audience.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:10.300]   We are an army, an army of vigilantes that exist to live within the law to fight evil.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.400]   We do so by day and night wherever we are, not just shining a light where we are, but
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.400]   we go to darkness.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.720]   We run towards it, and we shine lights there.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   We change it.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.480]   We are the solution.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:29.240]   We are his plan A, and there's no plan B. I've seen people do this here.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:39.120]   My friends Chital and Christy, two ordinary girls here.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.420]   Their hearts stirred with compassion around a problem that they saw in their city, and
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.080]   they said, "We will give our lives to solving it.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.960]   We'll do everything within our power to extinguish that problem."
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.960]   And it's not brute force.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.440]   Everybody thinks about kicking in some door and bursting in.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.320]   It takes brains.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.320]   It takes smarts.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.560]   It takes the gifts and the talents that you've been entrusted.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.720]   You say, "What can I do?
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   I don't know."
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.280]   Some people say, "What can we do?"
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.860]   Others say, "What can we do?"
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:13.800]   You might need to paint a picture or write a song, write a story, write a blog.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.160]   You might need to go to some place you've never been.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.840]   You might need to tutor some kid in math.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.840]   Maybe you're good at math.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.000]   They need math tutors.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.080]   Maybe brute force is what you bring to the table.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.240]   We need that too.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.960]   We need that too.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.000]   I don't know what you have to offer.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.080]   Ryan Wall, normal dude, man, just a regular porch goer, stumbled in here, heard an announcement
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:43.520]   where we needed someone to go to South Dallas to build a playground.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.400]   He went building a playground, met Chris.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.040]   Chris said, "Hey, come to Nicaragua with me."
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   Ryan said, "Okay."
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.920]   They go overseas serving the poor.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.920]   They come back to Dallas.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.560]   Ryan's like, "We got to do this here."
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.860]   Goes to Haiti with me, catches a vision for what it looks like to serve your city and
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:02.720]   starts to immobilize young adults, regular people just like you who are in the room right
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.960]   now who said, "We will be vigilantes in our city.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.680]   We will fight evil in our city."
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:14.200]   They just go throughout the city working with our trusted ministry partners to care for
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:20.960]   the poor, to care for the widows, to fight sex trafficking, to care for those that have
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.240]   been taken advantage of, to care for the fatherless.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.260]   They say, "We will give our lives to this.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.480]   We will do this instead of the club, instead of the bar, instead of whatever the world
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   is.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   How do I create margins?"
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:38.240]   Start doing that stupid stuff and start doing this.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:48.000]   Turn off the TV, shut the book maybe, and start making war because it's going on with
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.480]   or without you.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.200]   I need some of you to step in the game.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.960]   You're like, "Okay, what can I do?"
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.240]   Some of you have moved to West Dallas.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.820]   Maybe you should do that.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.700]   Some of you begin to mentor kids through Mercy Street Ministries.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.700]   Maybe you could do that.
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.440]   Some of you have begun to coach their games.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.920]   Maybe you're just a good referee or an umpire and work through Mercy Street to do that.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.580]   Some of you have gone to Brother Bill's.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:22.440]   My boy Phil goes to Brother Bill's for the first time, raises a bunch of money and people.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.640]   It's a free grocery store for those that are in need.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.080]   He starts delivering these groceries with Molly and Jennifer.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.160]   They go to this one man's house and they share the gospel.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   Now the man's a believer.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.120]   He trusted in Christ and he's going to be in heaven with them one day.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.680]   Now they're friends.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.680]   You're sitting on the outside.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   You're watching this, being entertained like the angels.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.880]   That's the angels' entertainment, not your entertainment.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.000]   We're to be a part of the game, a part of the solution.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:58.600]   Maybe you can volunteer as a mentor or tutor the students in our partner Cornerstone School,
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.440]   Crossroads Academy.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.880]   My friend Christy Lichtenberg works, one of my heroes, who drives down to South Dallas
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.400]   from Carrollton every single day against popular opinion.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:15.640]   She's been shot at, fought, cursed at.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.080]   Tiny little woman who said, "Man, these kids need someone to love them.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.080]   I'll do it.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.580]   I'll give my life to this."
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.880]   Maybe you join hundreds of young adults serving in Second Saturday, which just happens to
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.920]   be this Saturday, to help rebuild our cities in some areas, some of the poorest areas in
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   our community.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.720]   You can sign up in the Welcome Center.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.820]   And I have a specific thing that you can do tonight is you can go to an unashamed meeting
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.420]   in the loft and you can hear more of Ryan Walsh's story, more of how God has used him
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.360]   as we're going to do another unashamed weekend.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.780]   Maybe that's step one.
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.460]   If you're like, "Hey, I don't know the gifts and the talents that the Lord has entrusted
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.640]   me to use," you go to your Find Your Mission class.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   It's Monday.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.600]   This Monday, 7.30 or 7 p.m., I believe.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.320]   More information there on the Porch app.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.320]   That's step one.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   If you've done that and you're like, "Hey, I know what I'm supposed to do," you go to
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.000]   unashamed because here's the deal.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.240]   You were made for this.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.320]   It's why God left you here.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.120]   You were equipped for such a time as this.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.840]   Let me explain and I'll close.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.120]   I'll wrap up.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   I love motorcycles.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.840]   Weird thing to say.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.200]   I always have as long as I could drive.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.200]   I've always liked motorcycles.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.360]   I've always had one.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.120]   I've had over 20, just truth be told.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.200]   I really like the idea of motorcycles.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.360]   I don't ride them anymore because I've come to the light.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.520]   I'm now a scooter man.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.160]   Scooters are better.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   Here's what happened.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.000]   I was on a motorcycle once and I hit a pothole.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.320]   That's just bad news on a motorcycle.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:58.000]   I went airborne and then I was kind of shaking up and I was like, "I don't want to ride motorcycles
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   anymore."
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   I came to scooters.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.080]   There's one particular scooter.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.360]   I'm going somewhere with this.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.360]   I'm Batman.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.520]   There's one particular scooter that I really like.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.600]   It's called the Big Ruckus.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   I had it.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.400]   It has these big tires, big fat knobby tires.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.560]   It's like this all steel frame, these huge shocks.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.000]   It's kind of this off-road scooter.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.120]   It's really industrial scooter, something Batman would drive.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:32.520]   When I had it, I would notice that I was driving and I was once afraid of these potholes, but
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.920]   I realized that as I was driving down the road and I see potholes on my Big Ruckus,
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:42.680]   I'd kind of move toward them because potholes on the Ruckus are fun.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   Why?
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.000]   Because it's built for such a thing.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   That's you.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   If you're here and you have the power of the Holy Spirit, you've been built for such a
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.200]   thing and you're wasting your life if you don't go and shine light in dark areas.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:06.240]   You're like a dirt bike on 635, which I saw the other day, and it looked very out of place.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   It's out of place.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.600]   That's not where you belong.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.760]   You can be there by day, but when you're off, you go and you find people in need and you
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.920]   meet that need.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.440]   You engage with them and you care for them and you build relationships with them because
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.720]   you have been equipped for this.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:29.300]   You have been invited into being Batman, being greater than Batman.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.000]   You are immortal.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.600]   Batman wasn't immortal.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.680]   You will live forever.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:38.680]   Let me pray.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:45.840]   Father, I pray that you would stir our hearts around such a message.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:52.640]   As Jesus sent out the 12 and then the 72, I pray tonight, Lord, that you would send
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   out the 2,500.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:05.880]   2,500 young adults just like the apostles, just like the disciples, armed with the Holy
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:11.240]   Spirit and the Word and gifts and talents that you've entrusted to them for such a time
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   as this.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:17.280]   Father, help us not to waste our lives, but to live it for you, loving you with all of
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.960]   our heart and our soul and our mind and our strength and loving our neighbor as ourself.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.240]   I love how you said as ourself.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:31.520]   You knew how narcissistic we would be, that we would love our neighbor as we love ourself.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.760]   Would you help us do that in Jesus' name?
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   Amen.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.240]   They're going to read about you in history books.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.000]   It's a fact.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.920]   Will be a fact.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:50.120]   They're going to read about you in history books.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:57.720]   It will read something like this millennial generation rose up and tried to overcorrect
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.000]   something from its parents' generation.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:10.220]   They were inoculated to truth that they stopped believing and they lost our country to values
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:16.640]   that were very different than the values that our country was built on.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:22.600]   Or it will read this generation rose up and corrected something they saw in their parents
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:32.080]   and they returned a nation's values back to the very values that it was built on.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.500]   And I promise there's enough of you in this room to make a difference.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:41.280]   If you don't believe me, try me.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   Try me.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.520]   We're doing everything we can with affinity groups and Unashamed.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.400]   We're doing everything we can to reproduce disciples that will reproduce disciples so
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.840]   that you would give your life away for this cause.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.120]   And if we can help you, if there's anything special you think, "Hey, I'm a really special
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.260]   case and need some really special attention," fine.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.640]   We're open, we're ready, we're willing.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   Let's talk.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.080]   Let's figure it out.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   [silence]
