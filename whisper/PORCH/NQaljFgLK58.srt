1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:25,320
 Let me dive in to thou shalt

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,060
 as we continue this look at the 10 commands.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,860
 We're gonna read from the fourth commandment tonight.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,000
 And then I'm gonna pray and dive in

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,960
 as we look at the commandment that is given more airtime

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,640
 or there are more words on than any other command

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,320
 as God just goes through the list of,

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,500
 hey, these are the things that I want my people

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,920
 who were just set free from slavery

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,280
 but don't know how to live free

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,980
 to be able to do inside of their life.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,180
 So this comes from Exodus 20, verse eight through 11.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,280
 It's where we'll be tonight.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,800
 And I'm gonna read that

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,720
 and then we will pray and dive right in.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,100
 It says this, God speaking in the nation of Israel says,

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,400
 remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,260
 Six days you shall labor and do all of your work.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,220
 But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,900
 On it you shall not do any work,

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,040
 neither you nor your son or your daughter,

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,520
 nor your male or female slave or servant,

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,160
 nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,520
 For in six days, the Lord made the heavens and the earth

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,400
 and the sea and all that is in them,

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
 but he rested on the seventh day.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,260
 Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,640
 Let me pray, we'll dive in.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,920
 Father, would you teach us from your word?

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,180
 Would just these instructions

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,280
 that were given thousands of years ago to your people

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,880
 minister today to the hearts of your people

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,440
 and lead and instruct our lives?

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,920
 Would you break through just the distractions

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,840
 fighting for our attention,

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,800
 break through the hardness of heart

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,640
 that our own sin and just the reality

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,600
 of having a sinful heart can create?

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,040
 And would you give us eyes to see

41
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,120
 and encounter the living God

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,280
 and the life and abundant life,

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,280
 the free life that he wants for us to experience?

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
 We love you, amen.

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,560
 Well, when I was in college,

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,340
 I had a chance to be a part of the track team

47
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,000
 where I went to college and I did,

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,700
 I was a part of the field part of track called javelin,

49
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,760
 which is not very impressive.

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
 There's like four people who do it.

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,920
 So not a lot of competition if you know anyone

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,000
 who wants to be in a collegiate sport environment.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,080
 So I was a part of this team and every single year,

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,700
 one of the things that we would do as a training

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,400
 or a part of training was this day would come

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
 called the obstacle course day.

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,980
 And it was my freshman year,

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,320
 I'd never heard of the obstacle course

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,380
 or didn't know much about it,

60
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,220
 but as the semester progressed,

61
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,920
 everyone would talk about, oh man, the obstacle course,

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,540
 it's the worst day of the entire year.

63
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,960
 Just get ready to have your entire body

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,920
 filled with lactic acid and it's just gonna be miserable.

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,960
 It's the hardest training thing that we do.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,440
 And so I'm like, man, how hard can it be?

67
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,320
 What's it gonna look like?

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,160
 And so the day finally comes

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,920
 and I begin to see what the obstacle course is.

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,600
 We're there at the track stadium

71
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,840
 and the coach begins to say, here's what you're gonna do.

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,120
 Each one of you will essentially do two laps

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,780
 of this obstacle course where you will perform a series

74
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,620
 of running and jumping over these different hurdles

75
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,020
 and you will run over to the stadium bleachers

76
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,620
 and you will snake four sets of bleachers

77
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,740
 carrying a 16 pound weight

78
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,180
 and then carrying a 30 pound weight.

79
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,400
 So you'll finish it, you'll drop the 16 pound weight up,

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,200
 run back, run around the lap, around the track,

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,420
 jump it over the hurdles, grab the 30 pound weight,

82
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,380
 carry it with you and jump over the hurdles again,

83
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,220
 carry it over there and snake the bleachers.

84
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,680
 He looks at me, says, David, you're gonna set the pace.

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,500
 So I was a young, new guy, didn't exactly know

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,700
 what this would look like but he's like,

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
 you're gonna set the pace, you're gonna kick it off

88
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,220
 and start it for all of us.

89
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,300
 And I'm like, man, all right, well, showtime, here we go.

90
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,660
 Gotta show 'em who's boss, okay.

91
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,620
 And so I get ready, I'm mentally trying to think through

92
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,140
 what my strategy is here and he says, go.

93
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,300
 And all of a sudden I take off and I am just like,

94
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,220
 I don't know if it was adrenaline or nerves

95
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,380
 but I'm just in a full out dead sprint.

96
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,380
 And I'm carrying this shot put and I'm going over the hurdle

97
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,580
 and I'm snaking the bleachers and I'm running up things

98
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,940
 and I'm like, oh my gosh, I think maybe I was born

99
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,220
 to be a sprinter, I was made to do this.

100
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,900
 I'm breaking records, I can see the coach over there

101
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,140
 showing stopwatch and I can tell, man,

102
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,180
 things are really going good.

103
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,900
 Set down the shot put, begin to snake the bleachers again

104
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,540
 which just means to run up 'em and run down 'em

105
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,860
 in case you're not following me.

106
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,620
 And I go back, pick up the 30 pound weight

107
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,160
 and I begin to start lap number two

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,700
 and all of a sudden it's like everything in my body

109
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,700
 was like, we gave it all we had, shut her down, okay.

110
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,420
 And like I couldn't move, I'm climbing up stairs

111
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,460
 and my legs are beginning to wobble out

112
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,420
 and I can barely feel anything.

113
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,740
 And I go from a dead out sprint like Usain Bolt

114
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,780
 to just, I'm just walking and carrying the weight

115
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,060
 and like literally to the point where I mean,

116
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,780
 like crowds, the track team is now gathering around

117
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,780
 being like, oh my gosh, they're having a pity party

118
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,840
 for like somebody put him out of his misery.

119
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,980
 What is this man doing here?

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,660
 He clearly doesn't belong here.

121
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,940
 And I'm running and I had to walk the entire thing

122
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,980
 and I finally finished and I get over there

123
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,820
 and I just collapse on the ground

124
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,060
 and the coach comes over and he goes,

125
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,200
 man, that was the fastest first lap I've ever seen.

126
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,780
 And he had like this thick accent, I won't even try it.

127
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,340
 But that was the slowest second lap I've ever seen.

128
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,620
 (congregation laughing)

129
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,940
 And I got last place.

130
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,860
 I mean, I got last beyond every, all the shot put people,

131
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,700
 everybody, I came in like minutes and minutes behind them

132
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,700
 because my pace had caught up to me and it cost me

133
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,900
 that I hadn't thought through and just the pace

134
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,140
 that I had ran at eventually caught up to me

135
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,700
 and it cost me.

136
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,620
 And the reason I start there is because tonight

137
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,740
 we're talking about this idea of Sabbath and kind of rest

138
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,940
 and we live in a culture that just like that,

139
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,920
 I mean, it is no mystery that us as really a nation,

140
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,740
 a society, just in our generation,

141
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,700
 we are running at a pace like no one has ever run before.

142
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,660
 I mean, with technology and with the advancement in work

143
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,300
 and with the ability to kind of constantly be on

144
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,020
 and checking email and constantly be available,

145
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,020
 you and I are running at a pace that if we are not careful,

146
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,180
 we like much of America is experiencing right now,

147
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,060
 it is going to catch up to us and it is gonna cost us.

148
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,120
 I mean, stress, being overwhelmed is the number one cause

149
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
 of health and mental issues in our country.

150
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,680
 Think about that.

151
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,920
 America is the most overworked,

152
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
 developed nation on the planet.

153
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
 I mean, we just as a people, we just like,

154
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
 we run at this pace and here's the challenge

155
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,400
 or here's the problem 'cause I think all of us,

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,000
 nobody's like, yeah, I wanna run at a pace where I,

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,640
 you know, it eventually comes up to me and cost me.

158
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
 I don't think anybody wants to,

159
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,280
 but it just feels like everything,

160
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
 like the world around us is just running at this pace.

161
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,740
 Like I'm barely even keeping up with everybody.

162
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,660
 You know, life is just so crazy and hectic and work

163
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,120
 and you know, everyone around me is climbing

164
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,380
 the corporate ladder and doing better

165
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,700
 and so I'm not keeping up in any arena,

166
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,060
 let alone, I can't slow down, I need to do more.

167
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,700
 I mean, I'm not making enough money,

168
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
 I don't have enough time to, you know, exercise,

169
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,140
 I don't have enough time to eat right,

170
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,060
 I don't have enough time to, you know, focus on,

171
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,180
 I can't keep up on Twitter and Instagram, posting enough

172
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,020
 and all these other people have side businesses like Etsy

173
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,780
 and they're selling some pyramid scheme thing

174
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,960
 and man, I'm just like missing out on life

175
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,320
 and I can't slow down.

176
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,440
 I feel like if anything, I need to speed up

177
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,920
 and it feels like the pace,

178
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,760
 though none of us wants to be driven towards the edge,

179
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,360
 is something that, man, it's just almost unavoidable.

180
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,420
 And tragically, I mean, we live in a day and age

181
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,560
 where it is just normal to be overworked

182
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,120
 and just stressed out.

183
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
 I mean, it's become, think about it,

184
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,660
 it's become commonplace to, when you ask somebody

185
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,960
 how they're doing, it used to be good,

186
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,240
 the common universally accepted response is,

187
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,920
 I'm doing good, it's just busy, just busy, gotta go, okay.

188
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,680
 And you never hear, at least I never have,

189
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,920
 hey man, how you doing, I'm just rested,

190
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,040
 I feel great, rested.

191
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,880
 I've never heard that, it's just not something,

192
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,560
 and if you did hear it, you'd be like,

193
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,120
 he's going nowhere, you believe this guy?

194
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
 I mean, it's like almost a trophy that we have

195
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,720
 and so what does it look like in a world

196
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,800
 that pushes us to the edge, to find rest and find,

197
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,700
 I mean, think about this, and then we're gonna dive

198
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,340
 into the text, the word stressed, if you,

199
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,940
 and we've all heard that word stressed,

200
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,580
 of hey, I'm just stressed right now.

201
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,180
 100 years ago, someone saying I feel stressed

202
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,400
 wouldn't even make sense.

203
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,900
 Until the 1920s and 1930s, it was never used

204
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,140
 to describe how someone's emotions feel,

205
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,540
 it was a physics term.

206
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,420
 Like, it was only used inside of physics

207
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,420
 when you're talking about like, oh, this bar bending

208
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,380
 and there's tension on it, the stress amount

209
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,380
 that's on there, and someday, some guy was like,

210
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,700
 that thing's about to snap, I feel like that's my life

211
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,380
 right now, and everybody else was like, me too,

212
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,940
 and it just caught on.

213
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,460
 I mean, that's a fact, and now everyone would say,

214
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,260
 I'm stressed, and so how in a world that feels impossible

215
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,380
 to find rest can the people of God,

216
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,820
 who are commanded to find rest, find it?

217
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,860
 And so tonight, we're gonna explore this incredible command

218
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,580
 God gives to the nation of Israel, the fourth command.

219
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,840
 They're in the order of priority.

220
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,540
 I mean, before he goes into you shall not kill,

221
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,020
 shall not steal, he says, you are going to take a day off.

222
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,420
 And so we're gonna talk about why that is

223
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,820
 and explore what it meant then, what it means now,

224
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,620
 and really, what it's always been about.

225
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,220
 So we're gonna be in the book of Exodus.

226
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,460
 If you have a Bible, you can flip there.

227
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,460
 The book of Exodus is about the exiting

228
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,900
 of the nation of Israel from Egypt

229
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,540
 into heading towards the promised land.

230
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,620
 So the nation of Israel has been slaves,

231
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,540
 they've only known slavery 400 years, they're slaves.

232
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,700
 God looks down, says, hey, I'm gonna send someone,

233
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,660
 I need to deliver 'em, Moses, and Moses goes,

234
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,260
 let my people go, the nation of Israel is set free.

235
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,860
 And though they had been set free,

236
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,060
 all they'd ever known was slavery.

237
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,980
 So they didn't know how to live,

238
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,100
 they didn't know how to conduct their life,

239
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,740
 they didn't know how to do really anything

240
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,700
 other than what they were told.

241
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,020
 So God looks down and says, hey, I'm gonna give you laws

242
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,980
 to lead you to life, not to earn a relationship with me,

243
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,040
 but because you're in relationship with me.

244
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,740
 And I love you, and I wanna give you laws

245
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,620
 that will lead you to life.

246
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,900
 Those are the 10 commandments,

247
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,020
 and really the law in the Old Testament.

248
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,780
 So number four is this, we read it a second ago,

249
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,020
 but we'll read it again.

250
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,700
 Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy,

251
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,340
 which is a word that just means set apart,

252
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,740
 different from the other days.

253
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,660
 Six days you shall labor and do all of your work,

254
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,500
 but the seventh day is a Sabbath,

255
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,020
 the word Sabbath is a word that just means cease work.

256
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,340
 That means stop your work, stop from working.

257
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,260
 It's a Sabbath day, stop from your working,

258
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,300
 to the Lord your God.

259
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,980
 On it you shall not do any work,

260
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,780
 neither you nor your son or your daughter,

261
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,940
 nor your male or female servants,

262
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,220
 nor any of your animals.

263
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,500
 So you can't be like, yeah, I'm just riding the donkey

264
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,060
 and he's pulling things out there.

265
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,260
 God says nobody's gonna work,

266
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,860
 neither any foreigner residing in your town.

267
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,980
 So God took it so seriously that even if you weren't Jewish

268
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,260
 and you're like, you know, here's pagan Paul,

269
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,020
 he's living with us and he can go out there and work,

270
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,220
 God says if he's amongst my people, he shall not work.

271
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,500
 I want everyone to stop.

272
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,220
 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth

273
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,820
 and the sea and all that is in them,

274
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,660
 but he rested on the seventh day.

275
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,800
 So it points to God's example.

276
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,580
 Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day

277
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,420
 and he made it holy.

278
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,500
 We're gonna come to that,

279
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,980
 or come back to that verse in a second,

280
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,020
 but essentially God looks, tells the nation of Israel,

281
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,580
 in my top 10 list, I want you to take a day off.

282
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,400
 I mean, the unprecedentedness of this

283
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,060
 is almost hard to put into words.

284
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,620
 In other words, there'd never been any nation

285
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,060
 that we know of, no culture.

286
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,580
 If you study ancient civilization,

287
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,540
 no one else had ever done this before.

288
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,700
 No one else really would do anything like this

289
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,660
 for centuries and centuries and centuries

290
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,320
 where God would say, hey, you're going to stop working.

291
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,660
 Now this first idea that we're gonna pull from the text

292
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,380
 of these three ideas that we see

293
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,580
 of how we can experience a life that experiences rest

294
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,260
 is that we, like the nation of Israel,

295
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,900
 have to stop maxing out your life.

296
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,100
 That's what he looked down and he said,

297
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,520
 I don't want you to max out your life.

298
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,200
 I don't want you to fill, you could work seven days,

299
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,600
 but I don't want you to fill your life to its max capacity.

300
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,400
 I want you to step back from the edge.

301
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,440
 Wherever you're maxed out is,

302
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
 I want you to step back from the edge.

303
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,720
 Don't go all the way to the limit.

304
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
 And I want you to trust me

305
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
 with the gap that is created there.

306
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,360
 And you might be thinking, why would you have to trust him?

307
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,440
 I mean, think about in this time,

308
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,740
 what's on the line is you're living in a very different age.

309
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,140
 So when God says, hey, I don't want you

310
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,420
 to stop working entirely, everybody stops.

311
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,660
 I mean, at this point in time, it's dangerous to do that.

312
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,900
 There's no refrigeration, there's no, you know,

313
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,780
 hey, our water system just comes right out of the ground.

314
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,700
 They live in a day and age where you think you're busy.

315
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,800
 You don't have to milk a cow this morning.

316
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,260
 You don't have to pluck chicken and, you know,

317
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,260
 cook it up in order to eat it.

318
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,300
 You don't have to dig a well to get water.

319
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,340
 You don't have to build your own house by hand.

320
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,540
 In this day and age, they're going, man,

321
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,020
 if we don't work, we may not eat.

322
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,380
 We may not have a place to stay.

323
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,420
 You're asking us to pull back from the edge

324
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,920
 and just trust you with that?

325
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,860
 And God was saying to the nation of Israel,

326
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,380
 every week, I want you to stop.

327
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,060
 And I want you to show yourself and showcase to the world

328
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,860
 that my confidence doesn't come from my ability

329
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,420
 to make things happen, but from my God

330
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,020
 who can make things happen.

331
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,020
 In other words, the Sabbath day was not primarily

332
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,380
 about recovery and about rest.

333
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,260
 It was about trust.

334
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,300
 I want you to trust me.

335
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,580
 I want you to pull back from the edge.

336
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,660
 I know you could go seven days.

337
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,340
 All the other nations are gonna go seven days.

338
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,780
 I want you to pull back from the edge and trust me.

339
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,260
 And so your animals don't work, nobody works.

340
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,740
 And it's not just, hey, you have, you know, your muscles,

341
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,140
 they need a day off and tension.

342
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,020
 While that may be beneficial,

343
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,580
 clearly it wasn't the primary reason.

344
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,700
 I mean, shortly after this, in case you're like,

345
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,580
 really, huh, shortly after this,

346
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,820
 the nation of Israel is headed towards the promised land.

347
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,860
 And they're walking towards it,

348
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,660
 and they're out in the desert, it tells us,

349
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,020
 and there's no food.

350
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,960
 And God says, hey, I'm gonna provide for you food

351
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,060
 six days a week.

352
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,460
 Every single day, you're gonna wake up,

353
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,900
 there's gonna be bread on the ground.

354
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
 How crazy is that?

355
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,660
 And they'd wake up and there'd be this, you know,

356
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,140
 these flakes, the first frosted flakes, if you will,

357
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,020
 were out on the ground.

358
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,420
 And you would go out and you were told,

359
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,740
 hey, you could pick up one bucket.

360
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,560
 That's what God said.

361
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,580
 Hey, each person gets one bucket,

362
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,740
 you get one day's worth of food.

363
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,140
 So they go out every single day, they're like,

364
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
 oh my gosh, it's here again.

365
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,380
 And they would pick up the food,

366
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,300
 they'd put it in their bucket,

367
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,940
 and God said, hey, you only get your daily bread,

368
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,460
 you can't get two days worth.

369
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,140
 If you get two days worth, it's gonna rot.

370
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,180
 In other words, if you try to be like,

371
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,820
 oh my, store it all up, make sure that we get enough,

372
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,180
 then you, everything that you don't eat that day,

373
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,060
 you're gonna take it home,

374
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,660
 and it's gonna get filled with maggots,

375
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,140
 which is what happened, we're told, if you read the story.

376
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,900
 So every day they'd go out, get their bread,

377
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,020
 it would be enough.

378
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,980
 On one day a week, though, things were different.

379
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,660
 The sixth day, the day right before the Sabbath, the seventh,

380
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,820
 where God said, hey, you are gonna go out,

381
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,940
 and it says this in Exodus 16,

382
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,540
 that the Lord has given you the Sabbath,

383
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,140
 which is why on the sixth day,

384
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,380
 he gives you bread for two days.

385
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,580
 This is verse 29 of 16.

386
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,020
 Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day

387
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,920
 and to not go out, not go out and pick up bread.

388
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,380
 So God says, except for one day a week,

389
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,820
 you're gonna go, you're gonna pick up two buckets.

390
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,460
 If the Sabbath, and then they would go out,

391
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,860
 they'd eat, and it wouldn't rot,

392
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,820
 it would last for the Sabbath.

393
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,260
 Now, if the Sabbath, think about this,

394
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,080
 if the Sabbath was just about recovery and your body,

395
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,260
 they're not doing any work.

396
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,540
 Like, they're picking up a bucket.

397
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,820
 It's not that challenging, and think about it even further.

398
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,720
 I mean, if it was just about recovery,

399
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,260
 God, you're doubling up the workload.

400
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,060
 If the bucket thing is really, really hard,

401
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,460
 so hard we need a day off, you're doubling it up.

402
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,660
 On Saturday, it clearly wasn't about,

403
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,120
 man, you need a rest from your morning bucket pickup.

404
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,700
 It clearly was about, I want you to trust me.

405
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,620
 I want you to know that I'm a God who provides,

406
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,980
 and I want your confidence to come,

407
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,580
 not from your ability to work,

408
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,280
 your ability to make things happen,

409
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,920
 but I want you to weakly be reminded, I provide.

410
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,860
 Your confidence, trust, is in me, not in you,

411
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,180
 not in your work, not in what you can provide

412
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,020
 and you can do, and the nation of Israel

413
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,100
 is given this constant, week in, week out reminder from God.

414
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,660
 You are to depend on me.

415
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,760
 That God wanted his people to be free

416
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,940
 from just the lie that we still believe today,

417
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,020
 let's be honest, of, man, I need to get after it

418
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,660
 'cause nobody's looking out for me but me.

419
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,460
 And he says, man, I want you to be a people who know

420
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,560
 I'm the heavenly Father who cares for you,

421
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,440
 and I will meet your needs.

422
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,480
 I may not meet your wants,

423
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,420
 but I will meet the needs that you have

424
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,820
 and have the father-like relationship with his children.

425
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,540
 It's the same relationship he still wants to have today.

426
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,380
 I mean, think about it.

427
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,020
 I mean, let me tell you who's the least stressed person

428
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,460
 in my life that I know.

429
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,160
 I have a two-year-old son.

430
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,940
 He's not worried about anything.

431
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,560
 He's not worried about what he's gonna eat.

432
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,540
 He's not worried about, like, do we have enough milk?

433
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,180
 Can I have more, is this okay?

434
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,380
 Wait, he's not worried about, you know,

435
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,240
 I mean, we have to force him to take naps

436
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,400
 where it's like, oh my gosh,

437
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,480
 I would kill to be in your shoes, my friend.

438
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,800
 And he's just not worried about anything.

439
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,920
 The only thing he thinks about is,

440
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,520
 am I gonna get a Kit Kat today?

441
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,200
 I hope so, and I feel like this tyrannical father

442
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,120
 is not loving if he doesn't give me one,

443
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,760
 but he's not focused, he's not worried about anything.

444
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,500
 He has all of his needs met,

445
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,220
 and as silly as that sounds,

446
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,740
 that is the relationship that God

447
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,780
 invited the nation of Israel into.

448
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,980
 I don't want you to carry the burden and stress

449
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,520
 that if you don't, no one else is looking out for you,

450
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,780
 because I'm a God who loves you, you can trust me,

451
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,260
 and I want you weakly to know

452
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,000
 your confidence is found and comes from me.

453
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,060
 Inside of this room,

454
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,180
 I know that the temptation for most of us

455
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,340
 is to max out your life.

456
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,860
 And whether you're like, man, I mean, we can all,

457
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,620
 if you think about, like, why do we do this?

458
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,020
 Why do we just jam-pack our life

459
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,300
 and go from one thing to the next,

460
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,300
 and we work these crazy schedules,

461
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,700
 and we fill our life with one thing after the next,

462
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,620
 and being at Watermark, it can be just as easy

463
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,980
 to go from, hey, I'm at Watermark,

464
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,940
 to I am waterlogged, and have something to eat

465
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,780
 every single night.

466
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,260
 And if you think about, why do we do this?

467
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,360
 Some of us may say, man, it's just a season

468
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,780
 that I'm in.

469
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,700
 You may say, hey, this is just kinda how it works

470
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,580
 in my company.

471
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,800
 You may say, I just like it, I like being busy.

472
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,820
 But I think the reason behind, for many of us,

473
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,580
 why we do it, is there's this deeper issue.

474
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,540
 There's, like, a search for significance.

475
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,140
 Like, there's something inside of me,

476
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,940
 and something inside of maybe you,

477
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,080
 where it's like, man, I just want to be seen

478
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,420
 as someone who, like, is valuable.

479
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,580
 I wanna see as a go-getter, someone that they look at,

480
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,220
 and be like, man, that guy just, he gets it done.

481
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,700
 He gets after it over there.

482
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,400
 I wanna be seen as someone who can handle it

483
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
 high capacity.

484
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,200
 Someone who does have the, like, you know,

485
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
 I got these side hustles going on over here,

486
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,560
 and I'm working really hard and thriving here,

487
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,140
 and yeah, my Etsy company, would you like to see it?

488
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,040
 And I'm a photographer, would you need some pictures?

489
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,600
 And we just fill up, and fill up, and fill up,

490
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
 because there's something inside of us

491
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,640
 that wants to feel like we matter.

492
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,340
 And God says, I want you to work into the rhythm

493
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,080
 of your life, pulling back from the edge.

494
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,140
 If you are living a maxed out life,

495
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,540
 in an effort to fill your life with the most,

496
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,880
 you will cut out what's most important.

497
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,720
 And so why?

498
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,460
 Our relationship with God and others.

499
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,300
 Let me say it again.

500
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,980
 If you live a maxed out life, you will cut out,

501
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,060
 you will, in an effort to maximize,

502
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,860
 or to get the most out of life,

503
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,580
 you will take out or push out the things

504
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,740
 that are most important.

505
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,220
 And God said to the nation of Israel,

506
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,620
 I want you weekly to remember, I'm the Lord your God.

507
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,860
 I'm the one who provides.

508
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,340
 So what does it look like today to practice the Sabbath?

509
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,800
 Well, we know that, so the first idea is that you and I

510
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,280
 are to not max out our life or to stop.

511
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,160
 The Bible also tells us, based on that principle

512
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
 and based on other teachings,

513
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,480
 there's some things we need to start doing.

514
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,340
 But let me say this, in case you're like,

515
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,860
 wait a second, isn't this all the Old Testament?

516
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,280
 Are we underneath the Old Testament?

517
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,780
 Do we even need to keep the Old Testament law anymore?

518
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,720
 What does it look like to obey the Old Testament?

519
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,480
 What impact does that have on our life?

520
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,200
 The Bible says that you and I as believers

521
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,900
 are no longer underneath the law of the Old Testament.

522
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,540
 We're no longer underneath the laws,

523
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,360
 in other words, in the same way that they were,

524
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,940
 the nation of Israel was underneath the law,

525
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,640
 you and I have graduated from that system.

526
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,240
 But inside of the Old Testament, though we're not,

527
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,900
 we don't have a relationship with God

528
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,060
 based on keeping the law, and we're not under the law,

529
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,820
 there are still rules and still laws

530
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,300
 that apply or are applicable,

531
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,780
 there's principles inside of the laws

532
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,580
 that relate to our life.

533
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,900
 In other words, like when I was in elementary school,

534
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,260
 there were different laws that I lived underneath

535
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,140
 at my elementary school, so I couldn't, you know,

536
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,900
 run in the hallway with scissors,

537
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,500
 I couldn't throw food at the cafeteria lady,

538
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,180
 I couldn't go to class late, I had to, you know,

539
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,860
 be respectful of the teachers

540
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,700
 and just all kinds of different rules.

541
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,260
 Today, I stand before you as someone

542
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,340
 who has graduated from my elementary school, and--

543
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,700
 (audience applauding)

544
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,520
 Thank you.

545
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,200
 Thank you.

546
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,560
 Good night, everyone.

547
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,520
 (audience laughing)

548
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,520
 And I am no longer underneath the laws

549
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,060
 of my elementary school, I have graduated from that system.

550
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,800
 But there are still things inside of the,

551
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,380
 or still rules that were a part of my elementary school

552
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,560
 system that are applicable to me today.

553
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,080
 I don't have to be at class on time or I'll get a demerit,

554
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,200
 I, or have to change my color or whatever it is,

555
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,520
 I, but it's still a bad idea for me

556
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,760
 to run in the hall with scissors

557
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,480
 or throw food at the lunch lady.

558
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,900
 There are still things that are just principles

559
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,160
 that still apply to God's people,

560
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,400
 so it is with the Old Testament.

561
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,440
 Though you and I have graduated, Paul would say,

562
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,680
 we've been set free from the law,

563
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,840
 we are no longer under the law.

564
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,880
 Galatians 5, verse 19 says that you and I, verse 18,

565
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,760
 if you are led by the Spirit or follow of Christ,

566
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,080
 you are not under the law.

567
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,100
 Despite the fact that we have graduated from the law,

568
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,440
 there are principles or there are laws in the Old Testament

569
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,160
 and the principle behind them is still relevant

570
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,800
 to our life because it was given for a purpose

571
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,840
 to lead us to life.

572
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,240
 And so, it's really every single law,

573
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,720
 they're not all the same and they each,

574
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
 it depends on the law.

575
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
 Are you and I underneath the Old Testament law?

576
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,900
 Certainly not to be saved,

577
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,960
 but there are laws that there's still a principle

578
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,720
 that God gave that we are to obey

579
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,160
 and doing so it leads us to life.

580
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,680
 So you and I, as it relates to the Sabbath,

581
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,880
 are people who, from the principle of the Sabbath,

582
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,800
 now start intentionally slowing down our life.

583
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,240
 What does it look like to live out the Sabbath

584
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,080
 in the modern day?

585
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,040
 Paul says in Romans 14 that it's not really about a day.

586
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,480
 So in other words, if you ever heard people like,

587
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,560
 is it Saturday, is it Sunday, is it like any day?

588
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,720
 Is it, you know, I went to Cancun and that was a Sabbath,

589
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,440
 is that, like what does it look like to live,

590
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,320
 Paul says, hey, it's not about a specific day

591
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,660
 in Romans chapter 14.

592
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,840
 But the principle of slowing, intentionally slowing down

593
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,440
 is still relevant to the lives of the people of God.

594
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,440
 The best way that I heard it said this week

595
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,280
 is that it is a action that,

596
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
 what does it look like to practice the Sabbath?

597
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,400
 We start intentionally slowing down our life.

598
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,160
 You start intentionally slowing down your life

599
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,320
 to experience the rest God wants for you

600
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,500
 in a world that feels like there's no place to find it.

601
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,120
 You stop maxing out your life

602
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,000
 and you start intentionally slowing down your life.

603
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And this involves two things.

604
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 It involves the action of, hey,

605
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,520
 I'm actually gonna pull away for these few hours

606
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,000
 and be intentional with this time,

607
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,840
 or for this 24 hours, or for this amount of time,

608
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,360
 and be intentional with this time

609
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,840
 to do things that slow me down

610
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,120
 and that stir my affections to the Lord.

611
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,880
 I'm gonna do actions, I'm gonna intentionally stop,

612
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,560
 I'm gonna plan it into my calendar,

613
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 and I'm gonna say, on this afternoon of this weekend,

614
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,960
 or at this time, I'm gonna pull away

615
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,520
 and do things that slow me down

616
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,160
 and things that stir, to use a Christian phrase,

617
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,680
 that begin to stir my affections to the Lord,

618
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,660
 which is not a one-size-fits-all thing,

619
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,400
 but for each of us, it is pulling away

620
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,040
 and turning our mind on the things

621
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,260
 that cause us to worship.

622
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,720
 The reason I say it's not one-size-fits-all

623
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,760
 is for some of you, it may be like,

624
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,180
 man, I just wanna pull away and read a book

625
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,980
 in a hammock by the lake.

626
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,880
 And for others of you, that sounds like homework.

627
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,560
 You're like, I do not wanna do that.

628
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,440
 And so it's just finding and building

629
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,240
 into your life and my life

630
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,460
 things that stir your affections to the Lord.

631
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,320
 Is it binge-watching on Netflix?

632
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,120
 I don't think that it is.

633
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,200
 (congregation laughing)

634
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,040
 And here's why.

635
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,520
 Though that may be like, I mean,

636
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,540
 the problem is we run at such a fast pace

637
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,120
 that we're like, oh my gosh, I just wanna numb my life

638
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,360
 and just sit on the couch, eat Butterfingers and Blue Bell,

639
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,560
 and binge-watch on Stranger Things right now.

640
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,160
 And I think, (laughing)

641
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,960
 oh man, I think that the God,

642
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,000
 not that any of those things are necessarily bad,

643
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,920
 this is not an official endorsement of Stranger Things,

644
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,760
 I haven't seen it.

645
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,080
 (congregation laughing)

646
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,380
 Season two, I haven't seen.

647
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,120
 But I think that the God who's there is not just saying,

648
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,360
 hey, I just want you to tune out

649
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,640
 and numb yourself to the world around you.

650
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,400
 I want you to intentionally tune your mind into me.

651
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,760
 I mean, even the idea that it's not just amusement.

652
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,960
 The word amusement comes from the word amuse,

653
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,520
 as in a meaning ah, to not amuse,

654
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,580
 meaning to think, to not think.

655
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,760
 And the Bible says that Sabbath

656
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,080
 is not just where we amuse ourselves,

657
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,880
 but where we do things that intentionally,

658
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,080
 God says, worship the Lord.

659
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,740
 So for you it may look like pulling away,

660
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,000
 reading, journaling, walking.

661
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,180
 I don't know what that's gonna look like

662
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,020
 inside of your life.

663
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,520
 Maybe it's going on a run, hiking.

664
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,320
 But it's times where you intentionally say,

665
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,540
 I'm gonna do things that deepen my love for the Lord,

666
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,000
 deepen my appreciation for who he is.

667
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,600
 And then the other idea that comes from that

668
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,460
 is not just the action, or the slowing and stirring,

669
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,520
 which came up from Daniel Crawford,

670
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
 who heads up our college,

671
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,040
 but the other, beyond the action,

672
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,400
 is this idea of attitude.

673
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,920
 That you and I maintain the attitude.

674
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,400
 I think this is honestly the most important,

675
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,480
 in case you're like, oh, the action,

676
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,300
 what does it look like?

677
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,400
 Okay, go to the lake this Friday.

678
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,720
 I think above everything else,

679
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,080
 in the Sabbath and the modern day context,

680
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,400
 is the idea of the attitude of Sabbath.

681
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,040
 That it involves the action and the attitude.

682
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,080
 What do I mean by the attitude?

683
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,880
 God, to the nation of Israel, was saying,

684
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,800
 I want you to have it ingrained into your head.

685
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 Your mind sees yourself as dependent on me, the living God.

686
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,020
 I don't want you to think,

687
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,240
 I don't want your mind to buy the lie

688
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,400
 that you're dependent on yourself,

689
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,840
 or dependent on what others think,

690
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,920
 what others, you know, the job that you have.

691
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,160
 You are dependent on me,

692
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,920
 and I want you to live dependent on me,

693
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,200
 moment by moment, day by day.

694
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,600
 That I want you to go through your life

695
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,960
 and walk in a dependence on me.

696
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,920
 You can take off a day, a week,

697
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,300
 and not live out the Sabbath.

698
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,960
 If you don't go through life saying,

699
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,320
 God, I'm dependent on you.

700
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,700
 Like, you can take off a day, a week,

701
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,600
 and it just becomes a thing to do.

702
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,880
 Like, off the checklist, here we go.

703
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,280
 All right, and I have to do that.

704
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,800
 And God says, I want you moment by moment

705
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,880
 to see yourself dependent on me.

706
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,680
 God, I can't, you can.

707
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,640
 That means in everyday, ordinary moments,

708
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,180
 Lord, I'm headed from this meeting to the next,

709
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,000
 and I feel overwhelmed and stressed.

710
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,840
 I'm turning to you.

711
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,480
 Will you help me, the God of peace, to guard my mind?

712
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,080
 I'm gonna pray to you the things that I'm anxious about,

713
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,260
 and I trust in you.

714
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,440
 I can't handle it, but you, my God, can.

715
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,280
 I'm dependent on you.

716
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,360
 God, you know that I'm going to this party,

717
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,400
 and I'm gonna see that friend that deeply wounded me,

718
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,280
 and my temptation is not gonna be to love them

719
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,040
 or care about them, but I want to be

720
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,320
 what Christ would have me be,

721
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,760
 which is compassionate and forgiving,

722
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,240
 and all the different things you call me to.

723
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,840
 Will you help me in this moment?

724
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,000
 Because I can't, but you can.

725
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,240
 It's this constant attitude of Sabbath, of dependence.

726
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,960
 That's what the Sabbath is all about.

727
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,680
 Hey, I'm depending, I'm dependent on you,

728
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,860
 and I'm gonna trust in you,

729
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,240
 both in the action that I have

730
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,920
 and in the attitude that I'm gonna live my life with.

731
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,100
 So today, it looks like intentionally carving out time,

732
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,600
 and that you and I would intentionally maintain the attitude

733
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,480
 of Sabbath, and dependence, and trust on him.

734
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,980
 But ultimately, let me say this

735
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,180
 before we go to the third idea.

736
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,060
 I think the way that we often think about it

737
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,960
 is like the Sabbath is kind of this recharge.

738
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,660
 It's like, hey, when I plug in my phone at night,

739
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,500
 I plug it in, and then it's all charged up,

740
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,960
 and then I'm good, and I'm headed off, and I'm good to go.

741
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,420
 The Bible doesn't present the idea that,

742
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,380
 hey, Sabbath is just this one-time charge,

743
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,500
 and once you run out of battery, come back here.

744
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,340
 It presents this idea that you're never meant

745
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,040
 to run out of battery, but you're constantly plugged in.

746
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,580
 You're always abiding with him.

747
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,180
 You're always walking in dependence on him,

748
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,700
 and that's what he wanted the nation of Israel to get.

749
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,020
 He wanted them to get it so badly

750
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,120
 that he said, every six days, we're gonna do this again.

751
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,460
 So you see yourself as dependent on me.

752
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,000
 Do you see yourself that way?

753
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,640
 Putting your life, God, I'm trusting in you.

754
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,580
 I see you as the source of my provision.

755
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,500
 I see you in control of the circumstances of my life.

756
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,260
 I'm gonna walk in dependence, constantly connected to you.

757
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,300
 Finally, the Sabbath, I mean, it's clear,

758
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,740
 has never been just about recovery.

759
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,620
 We said that earlier, but if you even think about the fact

760
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,320
 that the way the Sabbath is introduced is in creation.

761
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,780
 I mean, it's clearly not because God needed

762
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,940
 a day off to recover.

763
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,420
 Think about that.

764
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,740
 Like, he says, look, I'm God.

765
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,900
 I don't grow weary.

766
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,400
 I work six days, and then I took one day off,

767
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,040
 and you're going two, too.

768
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,840
 Not because I need to take off a day,

769
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,480
 because man, oh gosh, that really took it out of me

770
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,320
 at that time.

771
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,700
 I'm God, I never grow weary.

772
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,960
 I'm omnipotent, I'm all powerful.

773
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,480
 And yet, I'm going to do it not 'cause I need recovery,

774
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,400
 or I need rest, but because I want to model for you

775
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,800
 something that I'm pointing all of creation towards.

776
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,920
 That the Sabbath has never been just about recovery.

777
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,460
 It's honestly not just simply about rest.

778
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,080
 It's about dependence, and ultimately,

779
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,200
 it's all about Jesus.

780
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,160
 Why do I say that?

781
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,160
 Years later, years later, the author of Hebrews

782
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,000
 would write about Sabbath.

783
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,840
 In the New Testament, there's a book called Hebrews.

784
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
 And inside of the book of Hebrews, he basically writes,

785
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,160
 and he says, look, hey, God gave them this rest,

786
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,000
 but all the rest was ultimately pointing to a later rest

787
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,160
 that God would give his people.

788
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,960
 Like, there was gonna come a day where he said,

789
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,920
 I'm gonna give them not just a temporary day off

790
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,040
 on a weekend, but an eternal rest,

791
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,820
 and the way they're gonna access that is by ceasing

792
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,840
 from their works and trusting in me alone,

793
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,160
 trusting in the God who works on their behalf.

794
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
 The message of the gospel, the New Testament,

795
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,340
 all rings throughout the Sabbath.

796
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,360
 In fact, in Hebrews chapter four, it says this

797
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,780
 in verse nine and 10 that the author of Hebrews,

798
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,080
 if you read the chapter, he's talking about how

799
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,640
 in weaving the Sabbath into Israel's history,

800
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,280
 God was sending a message.

801
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,640
 He was giving them a picture that the Sabbath

802
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,440
 would point to, a person, and a rest that he,

803
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,920
 that person would one day bring, that person being Jesus,

804
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,600
 where he writes in verse nine, there remains then

805
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,260
 a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

806
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,780
 For anyone who enters into God's rest does so

807
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,500
 and also does so by resting from their works

808
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,920
 just as God did.

809
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,820
 That the idea of the Sabbath, meaning cease from your works,

810
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,460
 was always meant to be a picture pointing to Christ,

811
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,340
 always meant to be a foreshadowing of the day

812
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,820
 that would come when Jesus would say, cease from your work.

813
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,900
 I will come and die on your behalf,

814
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,380
 and I will do what no person's work could ever earn them

815
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,180
 the right to experience a relationship with God

816
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,340
 for all of eternity.

817
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,460
 The Sabbath has always been pointing to God,

818
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,540
 always been pointing to God who works on your behalf,

819
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,100
 doesn't demand work from you.

820
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,980
 It's always been what the Sabbath has been about.

821
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,540
 And the author of Hebrews says it's like this picture

822
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,460
 that God early on gave his people

823
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,060
 that would point to a person.

824
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,760
 It's like I brought up here my favorite picture

825
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,860
 of my wife that sits on my desk.

826
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,620
 And there's a number of reasons.

827
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,760
 I'm not crazy about the frame, but I love the picture.

828
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,300
 And I love her smile in it, and it's from our wedding day,

829
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,940
 and I think she looks beautiful,

830
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,500
 and I just see it every day.

831
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,940
 But this picture, you know what it can't do?

832
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,380
 It's like, it can't talk back,

833
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,220
 it can't go on a walk and hold your hand, or my hand.

834
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,180
 It doesn't laugh at my jokes,

835
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,300
 even when they're not very good.

836
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,620
 It doesn't-- (audience laughing)

837
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,220
 But he does. (laughing)

838
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:37,060
 And it just, it's not gonna give you a hug back.

839
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,820
 It's not gonna, you know, it's just not gonna,

840
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,460
 it's gonna fall and pale in comparison to a person.

841
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,060
 Like a picture, it's as good as,

842
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,320
 it's only as good as its ability to point to a person.

843
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,540
 And it pales in comparison, like contains a part,

844
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,700
 and it kinda gives you a look at what it,

845
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,780
 a look at what she looks like,

846
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,260
 but it pales in comparison to her, the person.

847
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,200
 So it was with the Sabbath,

848
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,940
 that God said to the people of Israel

849
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,700
 that God has woven into creation,

850
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,540
 hey, I'm gonna give you a picture.

851
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,820
 And it was always meant to point to a person, which is Jesus.

852
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,660
 Like the very gift of, on the seventh day,

853
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,580
 you're gonna rest, is so that for years and years

854
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,940
 and millennia, and as long as there are humans alive,

855
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,740
 that they will know that there's a God who's out there

856
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,660
 who doesn't demand that they work for him,

857
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,220
 he demands that they trust the God

858
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,020
 who has worked on their behalf, who's given their life.

859
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,440
 The Sabbath has always been pointing to Jesus,

860
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,940
 the one who said, hey, will you come to me?

861
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,420
 I will give you the rest your Sabbath days

862
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,540
 will never be able to give you.

863
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,580
 In Matthew 11, he looks out into this crowd and says,

864
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,860
 come to me, I'll give you the rest for your souls.

865
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,740
 Your souls are crying out for rest,

866
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,420
 and you're not gonna find it anywhere else.

867
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,500
 You're not gonna find it in a dating relationship,

868
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,140
 in a job, in a bank account number that you have there.

869
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,380
 You're not gonna find it in the ability to have children,

870
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,940
 or whatever pursured future you see for yourself.

871
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
 You're not gonna find it there.

872
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,540
 Will you come to me, Jesus said,

873
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,740
 and you'll get rest for your soul.

874
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,580
 The Sabbath was always pointing to that.

875
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,240
 If you are not a believer inside of this room,

876
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,240
 the worst thing you can leave here and do is take off Sunday.

877
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,020
 But the best thing that you can do is to come and trust

878
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,860
 in the one who gave his life for you, Jesus on the cross,

879
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,420
 who accessed or gave you access and me access

880
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,260
 and anyone who will trust in Jesus's death and resurrection

881
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,820
 on the cross, that he died in your place

882
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,180
 for everything evil you've ever done,

883
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,300
 every abortion in the room, every look at pornography,

884
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,700
 every evil act, every hit that you've taken

885
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,740
 of whatever drug, every sip of alcohol,

886
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,000
 or drink of alcohol, anything you've ever done

887
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,500
 was laid on Jesus on the cross.

888
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,600
 He saw all of it in advance, said, I'll die for them.

889
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,780
 And if they will cease from their work,

890
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,740
 they'll have eternal life.

891
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,220
 They'll have eternal Sabbath.

892
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,920
 I don't demand that they work for me.

893
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,720
 I'm gonna cause them to stop because one day

894
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,620
 I'm gonna send my son the fulfillment,

895
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,900
 the person that the picture of the Sabbath was pointing to,

896
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,460
 to showcase I'm a God who works on their behalf

897
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,660
 where they trust in me.

898
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,880
 If you are a believer,

899
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,740
 I mean, the best thing for you to leave here and do

900
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,220
 is leave and fall in love, continue to walk with

901
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,400
 and have a relationship with not the picture,

902
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,060
 but the person of Jesus.

903
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And sometimes it can feel like, man, I'm even overwhelmed

904
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,520
 by I'm not doing good enough at keeping a Sabbath.

905
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,240
 It just becomes something else I need to do

906
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,800
 and ain't nobody got time for that.

907
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,100
 And man, help me, Lord.

908
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,600
 I think the invitation that God is there says,

909
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,840
 man, will you come, will you walk with me,

910
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
 take my yoke on me, he says.

911
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,720
 Walk and step with me and you'll see that my burden is easy.

912
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,880
 My burden is light.

913
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,180
 And you're just sitting around people, man,

914
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,420
 if you're not a believer, you're sitting around Christians

915
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,820
 and their life isn't perfect, it's got challenges.

916
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,860
 We live in the same broken world that you do,

917
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,180
 but our life is not, we're not better than you,

918
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,500
 but we're better off than we used to be

919
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,100
 because we have stepped into the Sabbath relationship.

920
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,580
 And we found the only source of life,

921
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,220
 the only source of rest in a world that is broken,

922
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,980
 in a world where there is no peace

923
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,960
 other than the peace that comes from the person

924
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,800
 the Sabbath pointed to.

925
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,760
 Let me pray.

926
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:33,120
 Father, as it's been said,

927
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,980
 our souls are restless until they rest in you.

928
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:45,520
 I pray for my friends in this room that live in the same,

929
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,620
 busy city that I do,

930
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,540
 and that live in the same busy city of Fort Worth.

931
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:57,100
 They feel overwhelmed, they feel anxious,

932
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,060
 they feel stressed, they feel insecure,

933
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,960
 they feel unworthy, they feel like they're not good enough.

934
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,460
 Father, would you allow just the truth of who you are,

935
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,540
 a relationship with you to break through from all the noise?

936
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,260
 Would you allow just people inside of this room

937
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,320
 for the very first time to come into a relationship

938
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,120
 with you by trusting not in how good of a person they are,

939
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,840
 but by trusting with Jesus,

940
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,660
 trusting in the sacrifice that was made for them?

941
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,480
 Would you help us in the room who,

942
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,960
 Lord, we don't feel like your burden is easy

943
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,000
 and your yoke is light.

944
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
 Would you break through to that, Lord?

945
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,720
 And would you give us that rest for our souls?

946
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,560
 Would you begin to experience that?

947
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,320
 And daily put our trust in you, daily go back to that well.

948
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,040
 Daily go back and experience having our thirst quenched

949
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,440
 at the only place that's possible to be found,

950
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,000
 or quenched, which is you.

951
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,680
 Father, we come now to the altar, we worship you in song,

952
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,840
 and we thank you that you're a God

953
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,760
 who doesn't demand that we work for you.

954
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,860
 You worked for us unlike any other God,

955
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,700
 any other religion, any other thing that we've ever known,

956
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,080
 that you're a God of great love,

957
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,820
 and that love moved you towards your people,

958
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,660
 not away from them.

959
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,680
 We worship you in song.
