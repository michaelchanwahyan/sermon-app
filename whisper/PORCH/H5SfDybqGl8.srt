1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,420
 (soft music)

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:21,300
 - I love it.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,100
 My family and I just got back from Disney World.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,160
 If we're Instagram buddies, you knew that.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,540
 I heard I over posted, I apologize.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,420
 And so we had an amazing time.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,600
 I've only been to Disney once before,

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,040
 and that was with, I think I was 13 years old

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,480
 with a church youth group, believe it or not.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,460
 I don't know how that fits in my story for you,

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,700
 but I did go with church youth group once.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,260
 And Disney's an amazing place.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,700
 I mean, it's known for its excellence.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,740
 I mean, Walt was a genius.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,600
 It's 62,000 employees.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,580
 It makes us the largest employer in one location in America.

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,180
 It's 40 square miles.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,060
 It's the size of San Francisco.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,220
 Disney World is.

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,860
 And there's this entire world that you've never seen

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,900
 that makes it all possible.

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,460
 It has these underground tunnels.

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,220
 It has a tunnel system under the magical kingdom.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,260
 And because it was built on swamp lands,

26
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,780
 these tunnels were built first,

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,500
 and then the magical kingdom was built on top of them.

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,260
 And this is where the employees go to and from.

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,340
 In fact, in the tunnels,

30
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,540
 this is where their wardrobe is.

31
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,660
 This is where they change.

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,580
 You'll never see two of the same cast members

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,420
 above ground at the same location.

34
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,260
 It will never happen.

35
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,020
 Even though they have 162 Mickey costumes,

36
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,860
 only one will be above ground at one time.

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,600
 I think I have a picture of the tunnels.

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,140
 I don't know if you guys got that yet.

39
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,980
 Yeah, there you go.

40
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,780
 That's the tunnel system there at the magical kingdom,

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,660
 and you can kind of see it.

42
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,140
 And I want to tell you something crazy.

43
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,580
 You want to hear this?

44
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,740
 I've been in there.

45
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,500
 And I don't mean because pastor privileges

46
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,600
 or anything crazy like that.

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,520
 Let me tell you how it happened.

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,980
 I was 13 years old,

49
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,320
 and this is why I don't remember much of Disney.

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
 We took a bus there,

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,320
 and I remember I had been waiting in line.

52
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,040
 It was hot, and I was at this restaurant at Disney

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
 in the parks, and I got this stomach cramp.

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,800
 And guys, I mean, it was like a stomach cramp

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
 like from Satan, okay?

56
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 Like I bent over, and I couldn't stand up.

57
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,440
 It hurt so bad.

58
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,760
 My stomach tightened up, and I'm with a buddy,

59
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,520
 and I'm like, "You gotta go get help."

60
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,720
 And it was because I was dehydrated and a wuss, evidently.

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,880
 And so here's what happened.

62
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,720
 Here's what happened.

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,960
 I'm sitting there, I'm in this restaurant.

64
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,480
 I'm crying, okay?

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,920
 I'm embarrassed to tell you.

66
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,800
 And I'm hurting, and all of the sudden,

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,760
 these people come out of the woodworks like Disney ninjas.

68
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,640
 I mean, just show up.

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,720
 I'm talking, they like walk out of walls and stuff.

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
 They're like, "Hey, do you need help?"

71
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
 And it was just like,

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,040
 it was like people who I thought were tourists

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,560
 who were actually employees of Disney came to render aid,

74
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,040
 and they grabbed me, and they put me on a stretcher, okay?

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,080
 And they take me, and they take me down underground

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 into Disney's infirmary.

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,960
 You can laugh.

78
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
 That's a true story, and I'm there,

79
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,000
 and I spent like a day and a half

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,120
 in the infirmary in Disney World,

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,040
 and I have very little memory

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,760
 of anything magical about the kingdom.

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,720
 But this underground world exists,

84
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,760
 and it's what makes the kingdom magical.

85
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,400
 Like, you're talking 62,000 employees coming together,

86
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
 working together for a common vision

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,720
 so that you can walk around

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,320
 and hardly ever even see a piece of litter on the ground

89
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,360
 and be impressed at every turn

90
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,160
 at how amazing the place is.

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,560
 It's world-renowned for the excellence that it strives for.

92
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,160
 And in the same way, God is building a kingdom,

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,920
 and we are the employees of that kingdom.

94
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,960
 And when we stop working for that level of excellence

95
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,640
 that honors him, like Greg said, and motivates his people,

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,920
 the kingdom withers.

97
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,520
 And can I tell you something?

98
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,120
 We've lost the kingdom.

99
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,720
 And when I say we, I mean we, our generation,

100
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,320
 our peers on our time.

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,280
 We just lost an entire country to pagan worship.

102
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,760
 Like, for the first time in the history of America,

103
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,200
 it is no longer a Christian nation.

104
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,640
 For the first time in the history of our country,

105
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,400
 we have diminished to less than half of the people

106
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,880
 who claim to be Protestant Christians.

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,160
 There's an article in CNN today that said these things.

108
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
 I'll read to you some of the statistics.

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,000
 46%, that's down from 50% just a decade ago.

110
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,320
 40% Christian.

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,560
 23% of our peers say they are spiritual but not religious,

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,960
 known as the nones.

113
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,280
 This is our generation.

114
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,720
 It's millennials and Gen Y that this has happened.

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
 It didn't happen in our parents' generation.

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,680
 It didn't happen in our grandparents' generation.

117
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,040
 It happened on our time.

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,840
 Why?

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,200
 Why, I told you before, I think we are poised

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,280
 for a great awakening or a revival,

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,160
 or we are about to slip off the cliff.

122
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,400
 And you just have a choice.

123
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,480
 It's like the Lord is looking at us,

124
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,320
 and I mean us, I mean the 2,000, 3,000 of us

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
 in the room right now, and he's saying,

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,240
 "Hey, do you wanna get after it?

127
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,320
 "Like do you wanna start living on mission?

128
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,500
 "Or do you wanna raise your children

129
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,780
 "in a very different country than you grew up in?

130
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,280
 "And the choice is yours."

131
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,240
 Disney's an incredible place.

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,080
 Here's what I've realized about Disney.

133
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,880
 They have capitalized on the gospel.

134
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,300
 Jimmy mentioned it in his spoken word.

135
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,100
 What's the story that Disney tells over and over and over?

136
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,460
 There's a person, there's a curse

137
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,460
 that comes to the land because of evil,

138
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,620
 and then there's the prince that goes into the land

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,020
 to lift the curse.

140
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,820
 And our princes, our princesses are sleeping.

141
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,620
 And our princes are fine with the princess sleeping,

142
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,460
 the beauty sleeping.

143
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,100
 Our princes are fine with Snow White

144
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,060
 being stuck with the seven dwarves.

145
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,140
 Our princes are fine with Cinderella

146
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,900
 under the curse of her wicked stepmother.

147
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,140
 Our princes are fine with Rapunzel stuck in the tower.

148
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,600
 We don't wanna climb, we don't wanna fight.

149
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,980
 We don't wanna do work.

150
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,120
 We wanna rest, man.

151
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,140
 Let us enjoy the kingdom.

152
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,740
 Another party, let's have fun.

153
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,700
 Let's enjoy life, make it about us.

154
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,500
 And we've lost the magical kingdom.

155
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,420
 It happened in our generation,

156
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,220
 unless we do something.

157
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,940
 And I wanna show you tonight from Colossians chapter four

158
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,380
 that I believe God is calling us to do something.

159
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,900
 That Paul is challenging you tonight

160
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,180
 through the word of God,

161
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,820
 that we are to live our life on mission.

162
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,660
 Paul wrote the letter of Colossians

163
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,740
 to the church in Colossae, it was modern day Turkey,

164
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,820
 while he was in prison in Rome in about 62 AD.

165
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,060
 And he writes this to address a heresy that has crept in.

166
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,780
 It's the gospel plus something else

167
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,220
 the Colossians began to believe in.

168
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,820
 It's the same thing that your peers and your coworkers

169
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,740
 and your neighbors have begun to believe.

170
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,660
 Yeah, Jesus is cool, but something else.

171
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,980
 You know, all ways lead to God.

172
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,180
 There's something else out there.

173
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,260
 This is the same problem that is going on here

174
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,420
 in the Colossian church,

175
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,980
 and why this book that we're in is so relevant to us.

176
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,460
 And so why have we lost our country to pagan worship?

177
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,980
 Because for faith, for many of us,

178
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,740
 it's just a personal, private idea

179
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,500
 that has been reduced to simply focusing on

180
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,100
 meeting our individual needs.

181
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,380
 And the church, a once very powerful movement,

182
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,940
 other-focused movement, is now full of consumers asking,

183
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,060
 "What's in it for me?

184
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,660
 "How can I have a better life?

185
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,100
 "What can God do for me?

186
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,020
 "What is he going to do for me?"

187
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,980
 So what's the solution?

188
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,060
 I think we need to understand the mission that is before us

189
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,780
 to do this kingdom work that God has for us,

190
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,060
 not for salvation, but from it.

191
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,740
 Not to earn his favor, but because we have his favor.

192
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,140
 We are the people underground,

193
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,460
 working as undercover agents, making it happen.

194
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,100
 So that others see a kingdom that they're drawn to,

195
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,060
 and they wanna be part of that mission.

196
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,620
 Tonight I'm gonna cover three things

197
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,100
 that people on mission have.

198
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,300
 Three things that people who understand their purpose,

199
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,060
 living life on mission, three things they have.

200
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,220
 Colossians 4, verse two.

201
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,180
 Paul writes, "Devote yourselves to prayer."

202
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,500
 Oh man, let's just stop there for a minute.

203
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,580
 Devote yourselves.

204
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,780
 Let me ask you a question, what are you devoted to?

205
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,100
 Like I met you, or I know you,

206
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,620
 like we live in the same proximity,

207
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,460
 I get to see your life,

208
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,300
 and I'm writing down the things that you,

209
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,060
 and I'm like, "Oh yeah, she really loves CrossFit,

210
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,060
 "and she likes North Park a lot, and she likes boys,

211
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,580
 "and he really likes to work out,

212
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,540
 "and oh, you know what, he loves his job, okay?

213
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,180
 "And he wants to be a millionaire before he's 30."

214
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,020
 What are you devoted to?

215
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,260
 Because can I just tell you something,

216
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,020
 none of those things have eternal significance.

217
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,860
 Not one of them will matter 100 years from now,

218
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,620
 not one of them, not a single one of them.

219
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,620
 And Paul says, "Hey, you devote your life to prayer,

220
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,480
 "to talking to the one who controls all things,

221
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,260
 "being watchful and thankful."

222
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,460
 There's a lot of debate around

223
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,740
 why this word watchful is here,

224
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,420
 and theologians kind of land in two places.

225
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,860
 One is because it's something

226
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,180
 they call spiritual drowsiness,

227
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,580
 being watchful against spiritual drowsiness,

228
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,180
 that you would be swept up in the world,

229
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,500
 that you would begin to live your life

230
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,740
 so focused on Dallas or Fort Worth,

231
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,340
 or wherever it is that you live,

232
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,220
 that you would forget the mission that you're on.

233
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,020
 And so he says, "Be devoted to prayer, being watchful,

234
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,860
 "so that you would understand

235
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,100
 "there's real kingdom work to be done."

236
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,140
 Don't get swept up and so caught up

237
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,300
 in the culture around you that you wanna be part of it,

238
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,740
 and you begin to invest your time, energy, emotions,

239
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,820
 and soul, and your mind into things

240
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,540
 that have no eternal significance whatsoever.

241
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,060
 You've got to renew your mind around what matters.

242
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,260
 And the other one is being watchful,

243
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,020
 because there's an enemy that hates you,

244
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,860
 and he's powerful.

245
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,700
 He's not all powerful.

246
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,460
 He's not nearly as powerful as God.

247
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,480
 It's not dualism.

248
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,580
 It's not these two forces that are opposing

249
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,460
 and of equal force.

250
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,540
 No, no, no, there's God, and then there's the enemy.

251
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,660
 But the enemy will jack with you, and he hates you.

252
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,220
 And he wants to turn your life into something

253
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,480
 of no eternal significance whatsoever.

254
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,540
 Like he wants you to get so caught up

255
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,660
 in money, and relationships, and pleasure,

256
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,740
 a temporary pleasure that is,

257
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,780
 that you do nothing with your life,

258
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,620
 that at the end of this,

259
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,400
 you don't hear mission accomplished.

260
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,380
 You hear, "You know, you didn't even really

261
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,340
 "start the mission.

262
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,340
 "I mean, you know, okay, but you never really engaged.

263
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,500
 "You kind of got caught up in Fort Worth.

264
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,420
 "You kind of got caught up in Dallas.

265
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,660
 "And you never really lived your purpose."

266
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,060
 Who wants to hear that?

267
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,840
 Now, don't say that to like put shame on you.

268
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,940
 Listen, we are saved by grace through faith

269
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,860
 in Jesus Christ, his work alone, not ours.

270
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,780
 But I'm afraid that our generation has forsaken

271
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,020
 the work that we have to do

272
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,300
 because of what he's done for us.

273
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,420
 That we can lose our life for his sake.

274
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,860
 Being watchful and thankful.

275
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,900
 And thankfulness is always in prayers.

276
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,800
 You see that over, and over, and over.

277
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,840
 And pray for us too that God may open a door

278
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,540
 for our message, this is Paul saying,

279
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,480
 so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ

280
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,580
 for which I am in chains.

281
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,420
 Now, this is interesting.

282
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,340
 Paul says, "And pray for us too that God may open

283
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,180
 "a door to this prison so that I can escape."

284
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,140
 That's not what he said.

285
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,880
 He said, "Hey, and pray for us too that God

286
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,980
 "would change our circumstances."

287
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,540
 No, no, that's not what he said.

288
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,260
 He said, "And pray for us too that we would be

289
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,560
 "faithful in our circumstances, that God would open

290
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,500
 "a door for his message to move forward."

291
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,060
 Oh, wow.

292
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,500
 Like Paul's concerned about things of eternal significance.

293
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,660
 He's not like, "Hey, Lord, can you help me eat

294
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,500
 "and help me get out of prison?"

295
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,820
 He's like, "Father, use my life, pour it out

296
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,720
 "like a drink offering that the gospel may move forward."

297
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,540
 Gets it.

298
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,420
 And pray that I may proclaim it clearly as I should.

299
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,740
 Paul says a couple things here.

300
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,420
 He says, "Give your life to prayer.

301
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,820
 "Don't get swept away by the world or the enemy."

302
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,600
 He says, "Pray that doors open, not the prison door,

303
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,860
 "but doors so that the gospel would advance."

304
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,740
 He says, "Pray that we would share the gospel with clarity."

305
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,860
 And so what Paul is doing here is he's showing us

306
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,620
 that people on mission have needs that matter.

307
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,000
 That's my first point tonight, in fact.

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,380
 What do people on mission have?

309
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,180
 People who get it, people who are building the kingdom.

310
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,300
 People on mission have needs that matter,

311
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,380
 which is good news because we worship the one

312
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,120
 who can meet all our needs.

313
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,020
 We worship an all-powerful God who looks at you right now

314
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,140
 and is not upset with you.

315
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
 He's not even disappointed in you.

316
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,660
 He is thrilled in you.

317
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,500
 He delights in you, and he wants to do an incredible work

318
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,060
 through you, not by your effort, but his effort through you.

319
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,340
 And he's like, "I love you so much.

320
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,980
 "I've sent my son to die for you,

321
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,880
 "and I'm ready to wreck shop with you.

322
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,920
 "Let's go.

323
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,660
 "Let's lock arms and let's get after.

324
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,600
 "Don't be distracted.

325
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,940
 "Let's go."

326
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,860
 See, if we understood what our needs actually are

327
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,160
 and who can meet those needs,

328
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,120
 then I think we would be devoted in prayer.

329
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,140
 We'd pray more.

330
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,540
 Like, how can you believe in a God

331
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
 you don't actively talk to?

332
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,540
 How can you say, like, "Well, yeah, I believe in God.

333
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,060
 "I mean, I talked to him last week sometime."

334
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,660
 How can you believe in an all-powerful God

335
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,140
 that he's given you complete access to?

336
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,100
 He's torn the veil through Jesus Christ.

337
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,700
 The mediator has come between you so that you can talk to him

338
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,500
 and have a personal relationship with him,

339
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,260
 and you say, "Yeah, I believe all of that.

340
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,620
 "I just don't talk to him."

341
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,300
 See, needs that matter lead to prayers that matter,

342
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,960
 and that's what Paul is showing us here.

343
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,580
 Needs that matter lead to prayer that matter.

344
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,980
 Disney is expensive, man.

345
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,880
 I don't know if you know that.

346
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,100
 We stayed for a long time to go there,

347
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,020
 and there's a lot of planning that takes place to get there.

348
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,840
 Like, you pretty much have to graduate college

349
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,620
 with a degree in Disney to get in the park.

350
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,700
 It's just a lot of stuff you've gotta know,

351
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,820
 and so I get there, and we get to the resort,

352
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,460
 and we're there in the first night,

353
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,140
 and it's like Monica and our three children

354
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,160
 are in this room, and I wake up at 2 a.m. to Weston crying,

355
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,140
 and then Monica goes and gets up, 'cause I was sleeping,

356
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,300
 and she gets up to care for him,

357
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,440
 and then she comes in and wakes me up and says,

358
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,940
 "Hey, he has a fever," to which I'm like, "What, a fever?

359
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,880
 "This is night one of Disney.

360
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,720
 "No way."

361
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,740
 I get up, check it, 103 temperature, night one.

362
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
 I'm like, "Oh, no."

363
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,260
 Weston's our 2 1/2 year old, if you didn't know,

364
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,260
 and I'm thinking, I'm like mad at God,

365
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,840
 if I'm honest with you.

366
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,900
 I'm like, "How could you do, like,

367
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,720
 "do you not know what I paid for this trip?

368
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,540
 "Like, I mean, I didn't eat for a week, so that we could."

369
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,340
 No, and so here's the deal.

370
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,540
 I prayed.

371
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,740
 I'm like, "God, would you heal him?"

372
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,940
 I'm like, "Lord, would you heal him?"

373
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,780
 And he did.

374
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,280
 True story, like, he woke up the next morning, he was fine,

375
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,460
 like, no fever, he wasn't even tired, he wasn't grumpy.

376
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,820
 Like, it was amazing.

377
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,860
 But let me tell you how my wife prayed.

378
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,540
 Now, she's the much more spiritually mature

379
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,700
 one of the two of us.

380
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,280
 She said, "Yeah, God, heal him if you want,

381
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,360
 "and please don't let this distract us

382
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,940
 "from our mission that you have us here.

383
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,280
 "And God, when we're on the bus,

384
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,240
 "and when we're in lines,

385
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,260
 "and we're walking through the park,

386
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,080
 "will you please not let our selfishness distract us

387
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,700
 "from the people that you have around us

388
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,060
 "that you want us to love?"

389
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,940
 (laughs)

390
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,140
 I just have a hunch that God's like,

391
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,060
 "Hey, JP, good prayer.

392
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,480
 "Hey, Monica, uh,

393
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,100
 (congregation laughs)

394
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,740
 "let's talk some more, you know?"

395
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,700
 Like, I just think he probably, like, lent his ear,

396
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,980
 like, "Oh, yeah, okay, I'll do that."

397
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,820
 Right?

398
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,140
 Like, her heart is just a little more aligned

399
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,620
 with his character and what he's doing

400
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,820
 and what he wants to do.

401
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,460
 She's praying from needs that matter,

402
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,860
 eternal needs.

403
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,840
 See, I think too often we look at prayer like room service.

404
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,140
 Like, I like to go to a resort and pick up the phone,

405
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,160
 like, "Hey, JP, New York-style cheesecake,

406
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,700
 "yeah, okay, I'll take one, you know,

407
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,620
 "and a burger, and in the morning,

408
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,860
 "omelets and some coffee if you could,

409
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,540
 "like, at this time, 'cause we like to sleep in,

410
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,280
 "you know, and I'm all about my comfort,

411
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,460
 "and I'm asking for those things

412
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,340
 "because I know that they can do that."

413
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,740
 And so I think we look at prayer like, you know,

414
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,180
 "Will you please let him ask me out?"

415
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,540
 And, "Lord, I pray that she's not pregnant.

416
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,740
 "Lord, I pray that I'm not pregnant.

417
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,840
 "God, would you please help me to get promoted?

418
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,920
 "Would you please help me to buy that car?

419
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,120
 "Would you please help me to get that apartment?"

420
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,700
 And I think prayer is much more like

421
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,580
 a walkie-talkie in a battle.

422
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,420
 Like, you're talking to the commanding officer,

423
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,740
 like, "All right, I'm going in.

424
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,860
 "Hey, what are you gonna have me do?

425
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,700
 "Okay, who is it?

426
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,540
 "Oh, you want me to share with him?

427
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,860
 "Okay, okay, who is it?

428
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,820
 "Okay, let's go, okay, so you love that one,

429
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,740
 "and that one, oh, okay, so you love them all.

430
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,260
 "All right, I'll share with them all, okay."

431
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,920
 And so you're like going back and forth, like,

432
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,580
 "Okay, I wanna be about your work,

433
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,220
 "align my heart with what it is you're doing

434
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,140
 "because life is short,

435
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,200
 "and I'm not gonna be here very long.

436
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,100
 "And in just a few decades,

437
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,260
 "I'm gonna be up there with you,

438
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,320
 "and I'm gonna be looking back,

439
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,620
 "and none of that other stuff's gonna matter,

440
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,540
 "and the only thing that matters

441
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,340
 "is the war that I did down here on your behalf.

442
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,100
 "And you made me me, and you gave me the gifts

443
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,900
 "and the talents, and the story that you gave me.

444
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,980
 "Like, how can I share faithfully?"

445
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,820
 Then I don't say that

446
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,260
 'cause I know there's introverts in the room like,

447
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,380
 "Oh my goodness, I can't feel my legs."

448
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,180
 No, no. (congregation laughing)

449
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,540
 Listen, listen, it's God doing it.

450
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,100
 God's like, "Hey, I got you, man.

451
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,560
 "No, I got you.

452
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,060
 "I'm just asking you to invite me into it.

453
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,820
 "Like, invite me into the war that you're already in.

454
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,960
 "Like, you're in a place where the kingdom is withered.

455
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,520
 "Let's bring it back, okay?"

456
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,020
 While we were there, we were at this kind of play fort thing

457
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,180
 and I'm there with the kids and there's this tunnel,

458
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,060
 and it's a little tunnel.

459
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,300
 And Weston, he's my two and a half year old,

460
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,140
 he crawls in there, and I'm like, "Go on, buddy, go on."

461
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,180
 And 'cause I see where it comes out,

462
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,300
 it just kind of goes around the corner and it comes out.

463
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,020
 And I'm like, "Go on, buddy, go on through."

464
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,380
 And he kind of crawls, puts one knee in front of the other,

465
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,580
 one hand in front of the other, and he looks back and goes,

466
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,120
 "Can you go with me, Daddy?"

467
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,940
 Yeah, oh, I'm six, seven, 250 pounds, and it's a small,

468
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,580
 and I'm like, "Well, you know,

469
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,300
 "hopefully those Disney ninjas are close,

470
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,220
 "'cause I'm about to get stuck in a tunnel."

471
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,100
 But here's the deal, that's what we're saying.

472
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,940
 "Hey, can you go with me, Daddy?"

473
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,020
 Now, I'm gonna go in there, but can you go with me, Daddy?

474
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,660
 Like, you're inviting God into the work that you're doing.

475
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,620
 And if you're scared, just turn back.

476
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,220
 "Hey, can you go with me, Daddy?

477
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,420
 "Can we do this together?

478
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,580
 "Can we get happy?

479
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,580
 "Do you wanna bring the kingdom more than I do?

480
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,980
 "Will you go with me, Daddy?"

481
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,900
 I've heard it said that when life gets difficult to stand,

482
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,980
 when life gets too difficult to stand, kneel.

483
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,180
 When life gets too difficult to stand, kneel.

484
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,140
 Can I tell you something?

485
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,040
 Life is always too difficult to stand.

486
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,380
 Like, life is freaking hard.

487
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,940
 And you may not realize that, but yeah, there's an enemy.

488
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,840
 He's after you, he wants to kill you.

489
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,980
 He wants to make you irrelevant.

490
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,860
 He wants to turn your life into something

491
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,860
 that has no impact whatsoever 200 years from now,

492
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,160
 that you'd be forgotten, to dust you'd return.

493
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,740
 And life's hard, man.

494
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,140
 And there's a lot of worries in this world.

495
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,420
 If you focus on this world too long,

496
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,860
 I mean, the worries can just overwhelm you.

497
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,820
 You could be given to anxiety, to a really dark place.

498
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,460
 And a God who holds it all in the palm of his hand says,

499
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,220
 "Hey, I got you, you're mine, I love you, and I'm for you.

500
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,460
 "And there's nothing you're gonna face

501
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,280
 "that I don't control.

502
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,460
 "Let's partner."

503
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,600
 First Timothy, I'm sorry, 1 Peter 5, 8 says,

504
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,840
 "Be alert, be watchful.

505
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,220
 "Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,

506
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,980
 "looking for someone to devour."

507
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,680
 But you don't need to worry.

508
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
 You pray and let God worry.

509
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,280
 All right, pray and let God worry.

510
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,140
 Paul says, "Pray that we would proclaim it clearly."

511
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,420
 Why, because prayer is the groundwork of evangelism.

512
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,940
 In fact, I would tell you, don't share the gospel

513
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,740
 with anyone you haven't prayed for.

514
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,560
 And I mean that.

515
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,780
 Like, if you're on an elevator with someone

516
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,620
 and you're about to engage with them

517
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,820
 around spiritual things, pray for them first.

518
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,140
 Like, make sure the Lord is in it.

519
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,500
 Make sure he's giving you the words

520
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 that you're not doing so by your own strength,

521
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,380
 by your own power.

522
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,260
 Prayer is the groundwork of evangelism.

523
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,820
 In fact, evangelism without prayer,

524
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,620
 it's like a car with no engine.

525
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,660
 It's like words with no power.

526
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,540
 We have to, prayer and evangelism,

527
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,900
 they go hand in hand.

528
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,980
 Prayer and sharing your faith goes hand in hand.

529
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,700
 We must invite the divine to awaken the dead.

530
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,780
 Because you can't.

531
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,340
 We must invite the divine to awaken the dead

532
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,260
 because saving is the work of God.

533
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,100
 Early on, I was going to Watermark.

534
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,300
 We met in Lake Highlands in the auditorium there.

535
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,500
 And I had trusted Christ.

536
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,580
 I was a new Christian.

537
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,860
 But I was like straight out of the bars.

538
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,300
 In fact, I still smelt like the club.

539
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,780
 I would still show up in kind of my smokey clothes

540
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,620
 from the night before.

541
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,300
 And when I moved to Dallas, I worked at Abercrombie.

542
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,660
 That's actually why I moved to Dallas,

543
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,860
 to work at Abercrombie and North Park Mall.

544
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,580
 I know what you're all thinking.

545
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,260
 Yes, I was the guy in front of the store with my shirt.

546
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,060
 No, I wasn't, I'm just teasing.

547
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,020
 Nobody would come in the store if that was true.

548
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,660
 And so, no, but I was there and I worked with this dude.

549
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,180
 And I see him in the parking lot of Watermark.

550
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,780
 And he comes up, he's like, "JP, what are you doing here?"

551
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,540
 Which was a fair question

552
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,580
 'cause he's like, "JP, party guy, what are you doing here?"

553
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,700
 And I was like, "Well, I go to church here now."

554
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,820
 And he's like, "You do?"

555
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,420
 He was like, "Wow, I didn't even know you're a Christian."

556
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,340
 He's like, "Well, I wasn't, but I'm a Christian now."

557
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,300
 And I was like, "Dude, that's amazing."

558
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,100
 He goes, "Man, when we worked together,

559
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,620
 "I prayed for you every day that the Lord would save you.

560
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,820
 "I prayed that you would go to church here."

561
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,180
 And you think, if you're here and you're a Christian,

562
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,100
 a follower of Christ,

563
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,340
 like you're the result of somebody else's prayer.

564
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,300
 Like you've been prayed into the kingdom.

565
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,620
 Like someone else prayed for you and now you're Christian.

566
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,220
 I don't know if that was your mom or your dad

567
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,340
 or a friend or a pastor,

568
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,900
 but someone prayed you into the kingdom.

569
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,140
 I mean, God saved you, nobody else saved you.

570
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,340
 And you being with God for eternity

571
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,740
 is the result of someone else's prayer.

572
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,780
 I love that Paul is in chains

573
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,340
 and he doesn't ask that his situation be changed,

574
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,440
 but rather that he would be faithful in it.

575
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,120
 Is it okay to pray for what you want?

576
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,000
 Absolutely.

577
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,240
 It absolutely is.

578
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,560
 But make sure you're seeking what he wants

579
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,240
 because selfish prayers make selfish Christians.

580
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,200
 Selfish prayers make selfish Christians.

581
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
 And so if you just look back on your prayers today

582
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
 and if they were all answered,

583
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,160
 like would you just have a better job

584
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,800
 and more money and a faster car?

585
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,700
 Or would there be dozens and dozens,

586
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,280
 maybe hundreds of people who are Christians

587
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,040
 because of the ways you prayed for them?

588
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,600
 And I'll tell you, one has incredible eternal significance

589
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,440
 and one doesn't.

590
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:32,060
 You've never seen a good person on mission

591
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,740
 who's not constantly in communication

592
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,860
 with the control center or their commander.

593
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,040
 And that's what Paul is calling us to here.

594
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,200
 And he says, "Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders.

595
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,680
 "Make the most of every opportunity.

596
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,120
 "Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders," verse five,

597
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,280
 "Make the most of every opportunity."

598
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,320
 And so what do people on mission have?

599
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,960
 People on mission have opportunities that matter.

600
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
 That's my second point this evening,

601
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,200
 opportunities that matter.

602
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,560
 This part here where it says,

603
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,440
 "Be wise, make the most of every opportunity,"

604
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,120
 in the Greek, it's actually an accounting term.

605
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,560
 He's saying, hey, you only have so much time,

606
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,520
 make sure that you exchange that time

607
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,320
 for things that actually matter.

608
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
 You wanna make the most of every opportunity.

609
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,780
 Don't exchange that time for things that don't matter.

610
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,400
 That's really bad investing.

611
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,100
 He's saying, hey, make sure you invest your time wisely.

612
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,560
 That's what Paul is saying here.

613
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,000
 Invest your time wisely towards things

614
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,180
 that have eternal significance.

615
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,600
 And he's saying, "Be very aware of when you are around

616
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
 "non-believers," those he calls outside,

617
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,240
 those outside the church.

618
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,840
 "These are indeed your opportunities."

619
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,020
 And he says, "Be wise in the way you act."

620
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,780
 He's talking about your conduct.

621
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,100
 In fact, 1 Peter 2, verse 11, says it like this.

622
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,700
 "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles

623
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,280
 "to abstain from sinful desires

624
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,440
 "which wage war against your soul.

625
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,320
 "Live such good lives among the pagans

626
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,740
 "that though they accuse you of doing wrong,

627
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,060
 "they may see your good deeds and glorify God

628
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,500
 "on the day he visits us."

629
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,060
 I can remember wrestling with this with my old friends

630
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,540
 who are not Christians.

631
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,020
 And whenever I was going to hang out with them,

632
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,660
 I would ask the question,

633
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,320
 am I going to be able to influence them

634
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,500
 or am I going to be influenced by them?

635
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,740
 And when you're wondering,

636
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,260
 hey, should I hang out with those old friends?

637
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,380
 You ask that question.

638
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,980
 Am I going to be influenced by them

639
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,860
 or are they going to give me opportunities

640
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,020
 to influence them towards the gospel?

641
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,980
 'Cause I think a lot of people are like,

642
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,060
 yeah, well, I'm evangelizing in the bar.

643
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,860
 It's like, no, you're not, you're drinking in the bar.

644
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,060
 That's not evangelism.

645
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,260
 What are you, evangelism, evangelizing for Sky Vodka?

646
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,260
 I mean, what are you evangelizing for, right?

647
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,260
 And so if you're living under that mantra,

648
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,940
 like, hey, I'm doing kingdom work there,

649
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,340
 then make sure you are doing kingdom work there.

650
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,060
 Make sure you're making investments that matter.

651
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,980
 And so what are the best opportunities

652
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,380
 for you to make the most of?

653
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,900
 Let me be abundantly clear with you.

654
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,140
 We go to Haiti, we go to Africa.

655
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,980
 If earthquakes hit Nepal, like, we'll probably go there.

656
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,580
 I mean, we go where the Lord needs us, where he calls us.

657
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,620
 Like, we'll go, we'll load you up on a bus or plane

658
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,700
 or whatever that looks like, a boat, and we'll go.

659
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,180
 And I hope you go with us.

660
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,460
 But the ones we take on mission there

661
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,180
 are the ones who live on mission here, right?

662
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,140
 That's the best investment of our kingdom resources.

663
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,020
 We take the ones on mission there

664
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,540
 who are already on mission here.

665
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,100
 And so what are the opportunities around you?

666
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
 It's where you work, it's your neighborhood,

667
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,540
 it's those you engage with.

668
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,620
 I've been very clear, I believe the darkest mission field

669
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,860
 I've ever seen is corporate America.

670
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,980
 Now, that's saying something,

671
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,660
 'cause I've been into the jungles of Africa,

672
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,020
 I've been into the jungles of the Amazon and Brazil,

673
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,580
 I've been to Haiti, I've gone to other places

674
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,220
 on trips to Mexico and other parts of our world.

675
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,620
 And I'll tell you from experience,

676
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,380
 the darkest mission field I've ever seen

677
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,860
 was right here in downtown Dallas.

678
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,900
 And there are parts of the world

679
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,700
 that are unbelievably difficult to get to,

680
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,060
 the Congo or parts of the Middle East,

681
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,340
 but it's very possible.

682
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,380
 But you know where I can't get to today?

683
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,660
 The ninth floor of the building I worked in

684
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,580
 every single day of my life.

685
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,340
 Had a security badge,

686
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,980
 walked through two security checkpoints,

687
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,100
 I had a cube with six people around me

688
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,780
 that I engaged with every single day.

689
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,540
 And no matter how badly I wanted to go there today,

690
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,580
 I couldn't do it, I don't have,

691
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,140
 I don't work there, they wouldn't let me up there.

692
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,060
 That's where God has opportunities for you.

693
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,020
 What are your opportunities?

694
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,300
 It's whenever you're around outsiders.

695
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,460
 These are the opportunities you're to make the most of

696
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,660
 and be wise in.

697
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,060
 Acts 17 says that God has determined where you live

698
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,740
 and when you live, strategically,

699
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,580
 because he wants to build a kingdom through you.

700
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,300
 That's why you have breath in your lungs.

701
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,980
 That's why your heart beats in your chest.

702
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,140
 I know in all of you,

703
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,820
 there's something deep inside of you that cries out,

704
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,900
 there has to be something more to life than this.

705
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,400
 And can I tell you the truth?

706
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,340
 There is.

707
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,300
 There is, it's his work.

708
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,140
 There is.

709
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,140
 Titus 2, verses nine and 10 says,

710
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,460
 this teach slaves, what Greg taught us as employees,

711
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,900
 to be subject to their masters or employers in everything,

712
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,740
 to try to please them, not to talk back to them

713
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,980
 and not to steal from them,

714
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,140
 but to show that they can be fully trusted.

715
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,180
 And here's why, you ready?

716
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,060
 I want you to hear the why.

717
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,660
 Work diligently and here's why.

718
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,980
 So that in every way,

719
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,140
 they will make the teaching about God, our Savior,

720
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,180
 attractive.

721
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,300
 Why do you work hard?

722
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,140
 For a promotion?

723
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,960
 No, for more money?

724
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,860
 No, to make the teaching of your Savior attractive.

725
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,660
 That's your mission at work.

726
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,900
 Your job exists so that others

727
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
 will be attracted to your Savior.

728
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,740
 That's us, we work here on earth,

729
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,460
 but we seek to do the Father's will as his chosen people.

730
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,220
 I, about two and a half days into Disney,

731
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,620
 I saw something really peculiar.

732
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,460
 I was sitting there in a line for a ride with my family

733
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,140
 and I looked in the bushes and I saw a cup.

734
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,980
 It was litter.

735
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,300
 And the reason it was peculiar

736
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,900
 is because for two and a half days, I had seen none.

737
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,640
 In a park of tens of thousands of people,

738
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,340
 maybe hundreds of thousands, I don't know,

739
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,140
 but thousands and thousands and thousands

740
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,340
 and thousands of people,

741
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,620
 I didn't see a single piece of litter

742
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,420
 for two and a half days.

743
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,820
 Why?

744
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,840
 Because of the 62,000 employees,

745
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,780
 they've trained all of them

746
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,340
 to constantly be about kingdom work.

747
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,900
 Even the princesses, they go through a class

748
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,780
 to learn how to pick up trash.

749
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,460
 It's called the swoop.

750
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,020
 Graceful.

751
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,580
 And throw it away.

752
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,260
 Without anyone noticing.

753
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,100
 You guys didn't even know.

754
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,920
 Here's what just happened.

755
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,220
 I just bent down and picked up a piece of trash.

756
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,860
 You didn't even see that.

757
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,700
 Okay?

758
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,660
 And they're trained to do that.

759
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,500
 Why?

760
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,940
 Because every employer there is making the kingdom magical.

761
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,860
 That's what we're doing.

762
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,740
 We work for a real magical kingdom,

763
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,340
 not some phony Disney Channel magical kingdom

764
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,580
 of princes and princesses.

765
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,800
 A real one.

766
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,060
 That is God's, and we're building it here

767
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,540
 in Dallas and Fort Worth and Plano

768
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,740
 and surrounding areas.

769
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,100
 We're doing that work here.

770
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,260
 I went to this biblical worldview class,

771
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,700
 and I remember sitting in the class

772
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,000
 and they kept saying biblical worldview,

773
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,480
 biblical worldview, biblical worldview.

774
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,580
 And I'm like, what, is somebody gonna define that?

775
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,420
 Because am I the only one in the class

776
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,700
 that doesn't know what that is?

777
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,780
 And then it hit me.

778
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,380
 Halfway through the course, I'm like, oh.

779
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,300
 Like it's just seeing the world

780
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,200
 as God intended it to be seen.

781
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,820
 Or it's making the world as God intended it.

782
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,460
 It's leaving every place I go better than I found it.

783
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,140
 Every relationship I'm in better than I found it.

784
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,260
 Could you imagine if you dated like that?

785
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,980
 Like could you imagine if your ex-girlfriend

786
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,580
 was a better wife because you dated her,

787
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,740
 because you're her ex-boyfriend?

788
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,700
 Could you imagine?

789
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,520
 Every place we go, that we would leave it better

790
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,580
 than we found it by the way that we engage with people,

791
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,260
 by the way we make the most of every opportunity.

792
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,700
 And so look back on your life,

793
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,060
 and what have been your greatest opportunities?

794
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,780
 And did you see them as mission?

795
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,060
 Did you see them as kingdom work?

796
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,900
 Did you see them as God's work?

797
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,500
 He says, verse six, let your conversations

798
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,700
 be always full of grace, seasoned with salt,

799
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,900
 so that you may know how to answer everyone.

800
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,820
 Let your conversation be always full of grace,

801
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,620
 seasoned with salt, so that you may know

802
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,700
 how to answer everyone.

803
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,540
 So what do people on mission have?

804
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,420
 People on mission have conversations that matter.

805
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,260
 People on mission have conversations

806
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,980
 that have eternal significance.

807
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,140
 This is our greatest tool to complete our mission,

808
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,580
 is conversation.

809
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,120
 So who should we talk to?

810
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,620
 Anyone we can.

811
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,300
 See to complete our mission work,

812
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,180
 we talk to God about people, and to people about God.

813
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,220
 What is our mission?

814
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,660
 It's to talk to God about people,

815
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,700
 and to people about God.

816
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,380
 This is how we live our lives.

817
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,460
 The tool that we use is conversation.

818
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,900
 The other day I was having appetizers with a friend,

819
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,020
 and we were just talking about,

820
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,140
 he's a pastor of ministry, my friend John Elmore,

821
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,720
 some of you know him, and we were getting up,

822
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,540
 and my buddy, John's an introvert, okay,

823
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,040
 and so he just, this story, I'm gonna read you

824
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,220
 the script of what happened, and it removes every excuse.

825
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,500
 And so he gets up, and there's this guy,

826
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,380
 the bus boy comes over to bus the table,

827
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,380
 and he's cleaning the table, and John says,

828
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,420
 hey, what's your name?

829
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,100
 And he says, Alfonso, and John says, where are you from?

830
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,660
 And he answers, and John says, cool,

831
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,660
 well, we work at a church, and I'd like to invite you there.

832
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,960
 And he looks at him, and he goes, I will come.

833
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,740
 And he goes, cool, it's 9, 11, and 5.30 this Sunday.

834
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,760
 And he goes, I will bring my family.

835
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,640
 And John goes, okay, well, I'll tell you where it is.

836
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 And he goes, I don't care where it is,

837
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,040
 this will be my church.

838
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,720
 This is word for word, and I'm sitting there.

839
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,180
 (congregation laughing)

840
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,560
 And John's like, all right.

841
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,320
 And so we walk to the car, and I'm like,

842
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,080
 dude, that was insulting, that guy was patronizing you.

843
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,280
 And John's like, oh, you don't think he'll come?

844
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,200
 I'm like, dude, there's no way he's gonna come.

845
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,480
 He said, bro, let me read it back to you,

846
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,160
 I don't care where it is, this will be my church.

847
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,400
 He's not coming.

848
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,960
 So we just go on about our day.

849
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,920
 I'm like, okay, John texts me the next day.

850
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,480
 He's like, hey, Alfonso just called, wanted directions.

851
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,560
 I'm like, dude, he's messing with you, bro.

852
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
 He's messing with you.

853
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,520
 I'm up here, I get here, it's Baptism Sunday,

854
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,560
 and I'm up there, and I bump into John,

855
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,000
 and he's like, hey, he's in here.

856
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,480
 And he shows me the text message,

857
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,640
 and the guy's like, hey, I'm listening

858
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,200
 to Laura's testimony right now, can we meet outside?

859
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,040
 I'm like, what?

860
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,500
 That guy, he doesn't go to church.

861
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,600
 John says, hey, do you wanna go?

862
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
 He goes, I will go.

863
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,280
 I will be there with my family.

864
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,320
 Who does that?

865
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,680
 Who says?

866
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,480
 John's like, hey, let's have conversations that matter.

867
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,160
 Like, let me have, like, this is fun

868
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,280
 been talking to you, okay, but here's the deal.

869
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,800
 I wanna have conversations that matter.

870
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,000
 Like, that story removes any excuse

871
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,080
 you could possibly come up with

872
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,560
 to engage someone about spiritual things.

873
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,320
 That dude, I mean, that's just the work of God.

874
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,080
 Is that not God just flexing?

875
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,480
 Is that not God just showing off?

876
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,160
 God's just like, hey, dude, do you want me

877
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,460
 to remind you that this is me and not you?

878
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,200
 Like, open your mouth and let me do work.

879
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
 Okay, God.

880
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,840
 So our conversations are always full of grace,

881
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,060
 full of encouragement, explaining the hope we have.

882
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,180
 I've got two little girls.

883
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,700
 Every day on our way to school, we go over this verse

884
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,940
 because they struggle with this.

885
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,340
 You know, sometimes they potty talk,

886
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,900
 and sometimes they hurt each other with their words,

887
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,860
 and so we just say, hey, what's Ephesians 4, 29?

888
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,420
 It says, "Do not let any unwholesome talk

889
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,820
 "come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful

890
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,420
 "for building others up so that it may benefit

891
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,860
 "those who listen."

892
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,660
 And I say, hey, who is going to benefit

893
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,100
 from the words that come out of your mouth today?

894
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,300
 Because here's the deal, words are powerful.

895
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,720
 Words break hearts.

896
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,740
 Words give hope.

897
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,820
 Words encourage.

898
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,900
 Words tear down.

899
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,460
 Words have power.

900
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,700
 They persuade men, and so once you understand

901
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,860
 that you've been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ

902
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,160
 you use your words to persuade men, Paul says,

903
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,180
 so that they would be a part of the kingdom

904
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,100
 that you are a part of.

905
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,500
 Do you want a good reason?

906
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,260
 Let me give you a really good reason not to slander,

907
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,700
 not to gossip, not to talk poorly, not to cuss,

908
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,120
 not to joke coarsely.

909
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,580
 There's no time.

910
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,300
 People are dying.

911
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,900
 People are going to hell.

912
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,300
 You want to waste your words on gossip?

913
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,860
 Ain't nobody got time for that.

914
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,540
 You're about to die.

915
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,360
 They're about to die.

916
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,020
 You're about to stand before God.

917
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,220
 You want to waste your words talking about stuff

918
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,300
 that doesn't matter?

919
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,100
 Who's got time for that?

920
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,260
 You've got a measly couple decades left, maybe.

921
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,860
 If there's a kingdom wilting around us

922
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,300
 we've got to lift the curse.

923
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,240
 We've got to do work.

924
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
 We've got to build it.

925
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,560
 He says, know how to answer everyone.

926
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,520
 Man, Jesus.

927
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,320
 You know how Jesus answered everyone?

928
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,920
 It would be kind of frustrating to me.

929
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,400
 He answered everyone with questions.

930
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
 23 times people asked him questions in the gospel

931
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,800
 and he responds with a question.

932
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,960
 In fact, I read a book called "Questioning Evangelism"

933
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,440
 that taught this evangelism method with questions.

934
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
 I find it to be really powerful

935
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,720
 that you can just kind of, people say,

936
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,280
 hey, I'm a Christian, I'm a Christian evangelist.

937
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,000
 You know, that you can just kind of,

938
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,840
 people say, hey, how are you doing today?

939
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,720
 And you just be like, hey, do you have a faith?

940
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,080
 Good, do you have a faith?

941
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,900
 You know, it's like,

942
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,320
 now we're talking about spiritual things.

943
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,360
 What a powerful question, do you have a faith?

944
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,420
 Do you have a belief, a spirituality?

945
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,520
 Do you attend church somewhere?

946
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,440
 Are you into church?

947
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,680
 Is that part of your life?

948
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,040
 Hey, what's your story?

949
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,120
 I'd love to hear your story.

950
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,280
 How long have you lived in Dallas?

951
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
 Now we're talking.

952
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,700
 Do you have a faith?

953
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,120
 Now we're talking about eternally significant things.

954
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,960
 Now we're living on mission.

955
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,240
 This is what Jesus did.

956
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,520
 People are like, well, what about dinosaurs in the Bible?

957
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,680
 What do you think about dinosaurs in the Bible?

958
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,520
 Do you think they're in there?

959
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,280
 Do you think that the Bible references dinosaurs?

960
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,960
 Have you ever read anything good on that?

961
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,480
 If I gave you something good on that to read,

962
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,160
 would you read it?

963
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,080
 Well, what about dispensationalism and transubstantiation?

964
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,300
 Dude, I don't know.

965
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,800
 I don't even know what those words are.

966
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,500
 (congregation laughing)

967
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,800
 But let me ask you a question.

968
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
 If I found out what those words are

969
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
 and how they're relevant to this conversation,

970
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,600
 could we have lunch and talk about it?

971
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,240
 (congregation laughing)

972
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,200
 Now we're talking about eternally significant things.

973
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,800
 Nothing intimidating about that.

974
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,720
 Well, how do you know that Jesus is true?

975
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,000
 How do you know he's not?

976
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,240
 How do you know the Bible can be trusted?

977
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,440
 Why don't you think the Bible can be trusted?

978
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,400
 We're just talking.

979
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,240
 No big deal.

980
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,200
 This is what it looks like to live on mission.

981
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,640
 Disney was a mission trip for us, for our family.

982
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,360
 I hope it was.

983
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,400
 I hope the trip was not just a vacation.

984
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,520
 I hope it had eternal significance.

985
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,920
 I'll tell you just about a glimpse of it.

986
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
 Not at all to brag or, that's not my heart,

987
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,000
 but just to show you how these conversations

988
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,440
 can be much easier than you think.

989
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,160
 We wake up, this is just the way back to Dallas.

990
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,800
 We woke up yesterday, I got back yesterday.

991
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,960
 We woke up yesterday in Orlando,

992
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,760
 called a cab early in the morning to the airport,

993
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,040
 get in the cab, there's a cab driver's name is Muhammad.

994
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,240
 Hey, Muhammad, where are you from?

995
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,040
 Bangladesh, amazing.

996
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,920
 Are you Muslim?

997
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,960
 What'd you say?

998
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,480
 Are you of the Islamic faith?

999
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,960
 Oh, yes, I am, cool.

1000
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,320
 Sunni or Shiite?

1001
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,160
 I'm Sunni.

1002
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,520
 Oh, man, amazing.

1003
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,920
 Bangladesh is 90% Sunni Muslim, right?

1004
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,320
 Yeah, yeah, well, how'd you know that?

1005
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,440
 Man, I'm a teacher.

1006
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,280
 What do you teach?

1007
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,800
 I teach religion.

1008
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,760
 Awesome.

1009
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,720
 Have you ever looked into Christianity?

1010
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,360
 Ah, you know, I don't know much about it,

1011
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,440
 but can I tell you about it?

1012
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,560
 There's a God, he's building a magical kingdom.

1013
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,360
 He did so through his son, Jesus Christ,

1014
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,880
 who died for everything wrong you've done.

1015
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,440
 We're talking about spiritually,

1016
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,600
 eternally significant things.

1017
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,120
 Man, how great is that?

1018
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
 Get to the airport, we get on the plane.

1019
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,920
 American, man.

1020
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,760
 Woo.

1021
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,680
 Had sorted my family, okay, five of us,

1022
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,320
 three kids, a two and a half year old,

1023
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,680
 all throughout the plane sporadically.

1024
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,880
 That's really bad strategy for American.

1025
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,800
 And so my two and a half year old sitting next to this guy,

1026
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,840
 he realizes that's a really bad idea,

1027
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,680
 'cause he's smart.

1028
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
 He gets up, he says, "Hey," to my wife,

1029
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,240
 he says, "Monica, why don't you sit beside him?

1030
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,080
 "We're grateful."

1031
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,840
 I thanked him, I'm like, "Hey, I'm so grateful for you.

1032
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,560
 "Hey, thank you so much for that.

1033
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,640
 "Hey, what's your story?"

1034
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
 Well, I work for 7-Eleven,

1035
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,920
 I'm moving to Dallas from Orlando.

1036
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,680
 That's amazing, man, I work in Dallas too.

1037
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,120
 Can I ask you a question, do you have a faith?

1038
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,080
 Well, it's funny you should ask that.

1039
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,800
 I was raised Catholic, I married a Mormon.

1040
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,960
 We settled on a Methodist church.

1041
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,560
 I'm like, wow, that's interesting.

1042
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,840
 (audience laughing)

1043
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,080
 It is funny I should ask.

1044
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,600
 I was raised Catholic, I married a girl

1045
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,720
 who was Church of Christian Science.

1046
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,320
 Very similar story to yours.

1047
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,160
 We settled on a non-denominational Bible teaching church.

1048
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,080
 Would you like to come?

1049
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,360
 He said, "I will be there."

1050
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,200
 No, he didn't say that.

1051
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,640
 (audience laughing)

1052
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,560
 He didn't say that.

1053
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,720
 But he did say, "Here's my card, text me the address."

1054
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,720
 And so, yeah, I'm sorry.

1055
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,280
 And then we get off the plane and my kids are hungry

1056
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,680
 and there's a papacitas in the airport

1057
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,960
 as we're waiting for our bag check.

1058
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,800
 And I said, "We will eat."

1059
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,600
 And we sit down, because I'm a caveman, evidently.

1060
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,000
 We sit down and our server comes up.

1061
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,640
 His name is Benjamin.

1062
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,000
 I said, "Hey, do you have 11 brothers?"

1063
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,440
 (audience laughing)

1064
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,360
 He said, "No."

1065
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,480
 I said, "Do you know why I asked that?"

1066
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,680
 He said, "No."

1067
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,520
 And I said, he goes, "That's a weird question."

1068
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,240
 I said, "I'm a weird dude."

1069
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,520
 And I said, "Do you know where your name comes from?"

1070
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,360
 And he goes, "Oh, wait, wait, wait,

1071
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,600
 "I'm a son of Abraham, right?"

1072
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,400
 I said, "Close."

1073
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,360
 And we started talking about spiritual things.

1074
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,240
 I said, "Are you in a church?"

1075
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,680
 He said, "Yes, I'm a Christian."

1076
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,200
 And then up in the conversation, it was very apparent,

1077
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,680
 Benjamin was not a Christian.

1078
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,680
 I said, "Would you like to be one?"

1079
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,280
 And we're just talking about spiritual things.

1080
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,520
 That's being on a mission.

1081
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,280
 And that's how we're going to build the kingdom here.

1082
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,240
 We've lost it.

1083
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,240
 And there's enough people in the room right now

1084
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,680
 and listening live throughout our country

1085
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,520
 and our world and in Fort Worth

1086
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,360
 that have everything it takes to bring the kingdom back.

1087
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,200
 If we just did the kingdom work,

1088
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,440
 if we just refocused on the things of God.

1089
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,200
 (pages rustling)

1090
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,160
 I want you to look back on your life

1091
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,880
 and the conversations you've had.

1092
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,880
 If it's been 452 gossips and 247 curse words

1093
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,120
 and 692 sarcastic remarks and 300 lies

1094
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,040
 and four times you shared your faith,

1095
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,680
 I wanna love you enough to know,

1096
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,120
 to let you know you wasted a lot of conversation.

1097
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,120
 There's very little eternally significant words shared.

1098
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,920
 And you don't have to feel shame for that.

1099
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,960
 Let's just change that right now.

1100
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,640
 Let's just leave this place and change that.

1101
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,520
 Just be different.

1102
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,040
 I don't know if you know what a knock is.

1103
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,480
 Anybody know what a knock is?

1104
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,160
 (congregation laughing)

1105
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,200
 This illustration's gonna kill.

1106
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
 No, I'm just kidding.

1107
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,320
 A knock is a non-official cover agent.

1108
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,120
 A non-official cover agent.

1109
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,960
 I learned this through a Navy SEAL friend of mine.

1110
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,280
 I was actually looking for an illustration one day.

1111
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,840
 What a non-official cover agent is,

1112
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,240
 if you've ever seen the first "Mission Impossible,"

1113
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,880
 you'll recall he had to recover a knock list,

1114
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,400
 which is a non-official cover agent list.

1115
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,960
 A knock is someone who is actually working,

1116
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,600
 but they actually work for the CIA,

1117
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,520
 they work for the government,

1118
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,840
 but they're employed by a company

1119
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,680
 like the company that you work for.

1120
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,160
 And so what this looks like is,

1121
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,360
 is somebody employed by the CIA

1122
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,440
 would actually go to like,

1123
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,920
 let's just say Richardson Independent School District,

1124
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,560
 and they would interview for a job,

1125
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,600
 and they would get the job,

1126
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,680
 but while they're working there

1127
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,880
 at Independent School District,

1128
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,600
 they actually work for the CIA.

1129
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,400
 They're reporting to their central command center,

1130
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,920
 their constant communication.

1131
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,520
 They're making the most of every opportunity,

1132
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,800
 being wise in the way they act toward outsiders

1133
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,120
 so that they don't get caught.

1134
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,080
 And they are having conversations winsomely

1135
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,240
 and purposefully to gather information.

1136
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,160
 And can I tell you something?

1137
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,480
 You're all knock agents.

1138
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,400
 You are all sent by God as non-official cover agents.

1139
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,920
 That's who we are.

1140
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,120
 All right, that's what we're doing.

1141
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,360
 And just to give it to you, another acronym,

1142
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,040
 you on mission have needs that matter,

1143
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,400
 opportunities that matter,

1144
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,840
 and conversations that matter.

1145
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,320
 N-O-C, you are a knock.

1146
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,320
 I'm a knock, a non-official cover agent.

1147
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,160
 And you can imagine how tragic it would be

1148
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,840
 if someone who worked for the CIA,

1149
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,200
 let's just say at the Richardson Independent School District

1150
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,880
 got so caught up in being a teacher

1151
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,320
 that they forgot they worked for the CIA.

1152
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,560
 And they just thought that their only job there

1153
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,920
 was to teach the students.

1154
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,200
 And they stopped talking to the Central Command Center.

1155
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,400
 They lost sight of the mission.

1156
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,080
 They stopped being winsome in the way

1157
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,240
 that they engaged people.

1158
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,440
 They stopped making the most of every opportunity.

1159
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,720
 And all they did was got swept up

1160
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,160
 in the job that was in front of them.

1161
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,200
 That the job that actually mattered got lost in that.

1162
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,200
 Some of us have lived that.

1163
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,500
 Some of us have lived that right now.

1164
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,400
 You think that all you are is an account manager

1165
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,040
 or barista or a teacher.

1166
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,280
 You think that all you are is an engineer or an artist.

1167
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,480
 You think that all you are is a sales rep.

1168
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,080
 And God says, no, you're an agent of mine

1169
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,480
 building a kingdom in a foreign land.

1170
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,960
 I have you on mission there.

1171
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,960
 Don't get so caught up in the world

1172
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,600
 that you forsake the mission that I have you on

1173
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,960
 and the things that I wanna do through you.

1174
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,880
 You're my agent.

1175
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,200
 When we were at Disney,

1176
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,640
 I don't know if you've been,

1177
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,960
 you can go and get autographs from like the princesses

1178
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,440
 and stuff and like Mickey and the characters and whatnot.

1179
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,240
 And it's really a magical kingdom for the kids.

1180
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,040
 And so you like gotta stand in line for this,

1181
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,880
 like Elsa and Anna.

1182
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,640
 Do you guys know who those are, Elsa and Anna?

1183
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,680
 Of course you do, okay.

1184
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,280
 Do you wanna build a snowman?

1185
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,960
 And so Elsa and Anna, the princesses,

1186
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,200
 you can meet 'em if you wanna wait two and a half hours

1187
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,720
 in 90 degree weather.

1188
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,440
 And you can get their signature.

1189
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,400
 And in the line is full of giddy six year olds

1190
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,600
 and seven year olds and eight year olds.

1191
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,640
 And every now and then, you would see a 34 year old

1192
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,320
 by themselves.

1193
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,360
 And in fact, there was one guy,

1194
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,720
 he sketched himself with all of the characters.

1195
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,560
 This dude was 29 years old, I think.

1196
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,440
 He sketched himself with all the characters

1197
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,680
 and then he went throughout the park

1198
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,120
 and had them sign autographs.

1199
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,160
 And he was just besides himself.

1200
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,680
 He's like, I got Cinderella's autograph.

1201
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,000
 And even my eight year old's like,

1202
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,560
 you know it's not really Cinderella, you know.

1203
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,000
 (congregation laughing)

1204
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,120
 And you just see these kinda weird creeper dudes.

1205
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,440
 Like there was this other guy,

1206
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,240
 that there's like this sorcerer game

1207
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,120
 and there's this six year old playing this game

1208
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,720
 and you have this wand and you go

1209
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,680
 and you're trying to get this magic ball

1210
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,360
 and do this kinda magic potion

1211
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,400
 and go and get the fairy dust.

1212
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,360
 And this 45 year old goes to the six year old kid

1213
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,560
 and says, hey, you're doing it all wrong.

1214
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,200
 Like you wanna go and get the star of magic first

1215
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,240
 and then go back and then get the green globe

1216
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,640
 because that's where the sorcerer's magic is.

1217
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,480
 And I'm like, dude, you're weird.

1218
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,040
 (congregation laughing)

1219
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,040
 He's like, no, this is what he said.

1220
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,080
 He said, I'm here every day I play this game.

1221
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,120
 And I'm like, bro, that's sad.

1222
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,320
 (congregation laughing)

1223
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,680
 Like your parents brought you when you were 13

1224
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,080
 and you never left, man.

1225
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,520
 (congregation laughing)

1226
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,920
 Like this is just a place to go on vacation.

1227
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,040
 Like it's not a place to live.

1228
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,400
 And you don't wanna get real caught up

1229
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,040
 in the stuff that doesn't matter.

1230
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,760
 And just like we see that and we laugh at it

1231
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,120
 because it's kind of funny.

1232
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,000
 Some of us we're gonna stand before God

1233
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,920
 and we're gonna realize we were chasing princesses

1234
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,920
 and princes and sorcerer's wands

1235
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,600
 and weird stuff that didn't trinkets and treasures

1236
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,560
 and promotions and cars and houses

1237
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,080
 and stuff that doesn't matter.

1238
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,720
 And one day we're gonna look back

1239
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,800
 and we're gonna see everything that actually mattered.

1240
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,840
 And I just wanna make sure you invested in what mattered.

1241
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,120
 I pray that we would invest in what matters.

1242
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,960
 Let me pray.

1243
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,480
 Father, would you help us do that?

1244
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:16,080
 Show us what is of you, what is not of you.

1245
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,960
 Show us the work you're doing that we might take part in it

1246
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,360
 and partner with you in it.

1247
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,160
 And Father, I pray that you would come in our world

1248
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,000
 like a hurricane and tear down the walls

1249
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,920
 and the kingdoms that we built that aren't your kingdom.

1250
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,960
 The things that we've held onto that don't matter,

1251
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,520
 they have no eternal significance whatsoever.

1252
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,080
 Father, would you destroy them by your power

1253
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,680
 and fix our hearts and our minds of you.

1254
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,080
 What a terrifying prayer

1255
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,160
 if we're gripping the world so tightly.

1256
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,720
 Father, help us loosen that grip.

1257
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:02,200
 Help us lose that grip for your glory and your honor.

1258
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,200
 Father, help us to live sold out for you

1259
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,960
 as agents on mission, being devoted to prayer,

1260
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,040
 making the most of every opportunity

1261
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,200
 and having conversations that are full of grace,

1262
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,000
 seasoned with salt so that you might save some.

1263
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,720
 In the name of Jesus, amen.
