1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 - James is made up of 108 verses.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 54 of them are imperatives.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,460
 An imperative is a command.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,040
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:22,280
 That Jesus was not just his half-brother,

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,360
 he was his Lord.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,640
 - Yes, he is his Lord and our Lord tonight.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,800
 Welcome back, Porsche.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,520
 We are going into James, like she said.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,000
 Our friends watching live in Porsche, Indianapolis,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,160
 Porsche, Des Moines, Iowa, Porsche, Houston,

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,200
 and of course my friends tonight here in the room in Dallas.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,040
 How we doing?

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,080
 Love it.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,240
 So excited to be with you guys.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,880
 And like she said, tonight, James chapter four.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,000
 We've been navigating through the book of James.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,040
 James is the half-brother of Jesus.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,520
 If you haven't been tracking with us

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,120
 and we are discovering the full truth,

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,020
 what it looks like to follow Jesus

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,960
 from his literal half-brother,

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,560
 a blood relative, James himself.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,320
 And we've just been committed to going verse by verse,

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,280
 teaching you guys what it looks like

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
 to navigate through an entire book of the Bible together.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,880
 So we've been enjoying it.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,800
 Last week, David talked about the power of our words.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,240
 And tonight, James is gonna give us what my Bible,

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,960
 I studied the ESV translation.

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,560
 So before I prep for a message like this,

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,120
 I like to just open up the Bible

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,200
 that I do my quiet times in.

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,120
 And there's like, you know, there's like subtitles.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,600
 And the subtitle for mine was Warning Against Worldliness.

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
 Any ESVs out there?

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,320
 ESV lovers, like me, yeah.

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
 Warning Against Worldliness.

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,440
 And I was just thinking about this idea of warning.

40
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,400
 And so before we read James's warnings to us tonight,

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,340
 I wanna tell you about a time where I didn't take heed

42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,360
 to a man named Billy Bob's warnings.

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,980
 And I was trying to think

44
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,920
 as I was articulating the story out loud earlier,

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,880
 like I just need to draw pictures for you guys

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 to help better illustrate it.

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,960
 So I'm not really good.

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,080
 I'm not an artist,

49
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,080
 but they'll come up as we tell the story.

50
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
 So here it goes.

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,020
 It was summer in college.

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,840
 I was given the task of leading about 40 leaders

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,200
 in our church to go and bond and get to know each other.

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,480
 They're like, you can do whatever you want.

55
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,000
 And I was like, what better way to bond

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,960
 and get to know someone than a canoe trip?

57
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,580
 If you've ever tried it, you should like take someone out,

58
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,800
 go canoeing, I don't know.

59
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,120
 And so we go on this canoe trip.

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,680
 We Google cheapest way to go on a canoe excursion

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
 for 40 people.

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,700
 And this place called Billy Bob's Yo-Yo Canoe Trip

63
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,320
 pops up in Louisiana.

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,680
 And we're like, do it now, do it.

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
 So we go, we get in the cars.

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
 I make everyone dress up in like Indian headwear

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,520
 and like paint and like teeth and like different,

68
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,680
 I don't know, it was weird.

69
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,440
 And we're getting in the cars, we're going.

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,880
 And then we start to get off road and go into a dirt road.

71
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,180
 And we're going further and further and further back.

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,740
 And I'm just looking for like a sign,

73
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,440
 anything that says Billy Bob's Yo-Yo Canoe.

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,560
 And then suddenly, you know, surely enough,

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,040
 we pull up on this little log cabin

76
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,760
 and it says Billy Bob's and this guy,

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,920
 I mean, exactly when you hear the name Billy Bob,

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
 and what you think, he walks out,

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,140
 overalls, no undershirt, one's undone,

80
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,320
 trucker hat, you know, missing teeth.

81
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,560
 He walks out, "Waltza, come on y'all."

82
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,480
 He welcomes us in.

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,680
 He's like, "Who's the leader of this here excursion?"

84
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,560
 And I'm like, "Me and me and my friend walk up."

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,820
 And he tells us how it's called a Yo-Yo Canoe Trip

86
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,240
 because you go down the stream.

87
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
 And then we're like, this is important.

88
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,440
 When you go down the stream and you go for four miles or so,

89
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,520
 and then it's lunchtime.

90
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
 And then it's really important

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
 where you choose to eat lunch

92
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,280
 because the reason why it's called a yo-yo

93
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,720
 is because then during your lunch,

94
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,120
 you're gonna hear the dam open.

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,160
 And when that dam opens, it's gonna release water

96
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,720
 and it's gonna shift the current back this way.

97
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,160
 So you'll zip back exactly the way

98
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,520
 that you came with the current.

99
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
 And I'm like, "Okay."

100
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,520
 And he's like, "But here's the warning."

101
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
 And he gets out this napkin

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,040
 and he draws a picture like this.

103
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,640
 He says, (congregation laughing)

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,920
 he says, "There's the dam, eat here, don't eat here."

105
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,080
 And so we're coming where that arrow is.

106
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,100
 And I'm like, we traveled for four miles.

107
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,680
 I dropped the napkin in like the water, it's all soggy.

108
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,080
 And they're like, "All right, I'm starving.

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,600
 It's time to eat our peanut butter and jellies

110
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,960
 and Cheetos and all of that."

111
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,880
 And I'm like, "Okay."

112
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
 They're like, "Where should we eat?"

113
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
 And I'm like, "Hmm."

114
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,520
 And I look at the napkin, I throw it away.

115
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,880
 And I'm like, "Here."

116
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,620
 So that's where I decided to take us.

117
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,520
 So I'm there, about 40 people,

118
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,080
 and I wanna be the guy that everyone likes.

119
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,000
 And they're like, "It's hot."

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
 And I'm like, "Well, the water is so nice

121
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,940
 and clear and shallow, go eat there."

122
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,200
 And so they're all happy.

123
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,880
 They're eating out in the middle of the water.

124
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,260
 And the reason why Billy Bob said,

125
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,600
 "Hey, you don't wanna be eating anywhere else but here,"

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,640
 is because when this dam opens,

127
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,800
 it releases class four level-sized rapids.

128
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
 And I'm like, we are in Louisiana.

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,820
 Like, this is not National Geographic, kayakers.

130
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,040
 Like, this is like, what are you talking about?

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,200
 And so they're eating out there.

132
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,880
 And surely enough, right on time, you hear,

133
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,720
 "Eat, eat, eat, eat."

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
 And, okay, the story's getting a little ahead of me,

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800
 but you see where this is going.

136
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,520
 Maybe you don't, I'm not a good drawer.

137
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,720
 But they're sitting there,

138
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,440
 and suddenly the water starts to rise.

139
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,480
 And they're like, "Oh, look, JD, like class four rapids.

140
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,040
 Like Billy Bob, like, what's he talking about?"

141
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
 And I'm like, "Yeah, you guys."

142
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,840
 And then before I could say, "Look out."

143
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
 I mean, it was like a stampede.

144
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,320
 We look over and they're like, "JD, pfft."

145
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,240
 And rapids take away people that were with us

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,640
 that I barely know.

147
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,200
 So I'm like, "Grab the canoes."

148
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,440
 And so we're grabbing the canoes,

149
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,080
 and I'm watching girls just get swept into these rapids,

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,120
 just one by one, losing people.

151
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,380
 And I'm supposed to be leading these people.

152
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,700
 So they go, and we're just like watching people disappear

153
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,480
 into class four level rapids.

154
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,560
 And I am just, I mean,

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
 wives are losing their husbands in these rapids.

156
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,120
 They're praying.

157
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,080
 I look over, girls are like, "Dear Jesus."

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,720
 Like they're praying together.

159
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,980
 People are trying to climb up the bank to escape

160
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,280
 as the water is rising up our knees.

161
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,060
 And then we all, I look at everyone,

162
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,640
 and the rapids finally subside.

163
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,880
 And I'm like, "I don't know where half of our crew is."

164
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,520
 And I'm like, like a good leader, every man for himself,

165
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,680
 get back however you can, just get back.

166
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,520
 We're losing canoes.

167
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
 We lost all of our food.

168
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680
 So people just get back to the destination,

169
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,300
 and we sit there, and guys, it is like nighttime

170
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,520
 before finally you just see people in a pack,

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,240
 dragging, canoes, soaking wet in water.

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
 Their feathers from the Indian headwear are like,

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,000
 on their face, the paint smeared.

174
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,880
 And they're like, I'm like, "Hey guys, what?"

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,080
 And they're like, "Uh-uh, uh-uh.

176
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
 We don't want to hear from you."

177
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,600
 And they're like, "Why would you do that?"

178
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,560
 And I'm like, and the guy's like, "I told him."

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,820
 They all look at me.

180
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,600
 And I'm like, "Ah."

181
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,200
 And I start there because just like I did not take heed

182
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,640
 to Crazy Billy Bob's warning,

183
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,520
 tonight we're gonna hear from James,

184
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,400
 the author of this book.

185
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,120
 And he's gonna list out a lot of warnings

186
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,040
 for young adults like you and I,

187
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,800
 and what it looks like to have a relationship

188
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,960
 with God in the world.

189
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,880
 And I think when we hear warnings,

190
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,000
 a lot of things come to mind.

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,740
 Like in our young adult years,

192
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,400
 we get a lot of warnings in front of us.

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,320
 Our parents, pastors, leaders, coaches are constantly saying,

194
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,800
 "Hey, like I wouldn't buy that new shiny car.

195
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,840
 Like you're gonna get in debt.

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,680
 I would go with an older car for a season

197
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
 until you get more money."

198
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,260
 And you're like, "No, I'll be making bank.

199
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
 It'll be fine.

200
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,920
 I'll pay it off.

201
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
 You get the new car."

202
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,400
 Or they're like, "Hey, pastors, oftentimes up here,

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,560
 like, hey, I would not have sex before marriage.

204
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,400
 I would really."

205
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
 And you're like, "What are you talking about?

206
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,920
 Everyone's doing it.

207
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,760
 Like you're so behind the times.

208
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,840
 It's a, it's a bog.

209
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
 It's like expression.

210
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
 Like it's an act of love.

211
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,160
 Like you're so like, what are you, it'll be fine.

212
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,980
 Like it's, there's no consequences from it.

213
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,680
 It's fine and we're not taking heed to warnings

214
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
 in our young adult years."

215
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,000
 And I think there's a few reasons why you and I,

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,640
 we don't necessarily listen to warnings.

217
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,960
 I was just thinking about one of the first reasons

218
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,780
 why I don't think we listen

219
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,800
 and why I didn't listen to even Billy Bob

220
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,080
 is because we don't trust the person

221
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,760
 the warning's coming from.

222
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,260
 We don't know them.

223
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,240
 We're like, "Hey, why would,

224
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,400
 why would I dictate my choices based off of what you say?

225
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,480
 Like you don't have any credibility with me.

226
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,440
 I don't trust you.

227
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,280
 You're out of touch.

228
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,440
 What are you talking about?"

229
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,860
 Another reason why we don't listen to warnings

230
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,300
 is because we think that we're outliers.

231
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,440
 Like this, this will pan out maybe for everyone else,

232
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
 but I'll be different.

233
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,480
 Like my story will be different.

234
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'm exempt.

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
 I won't have that consequence

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
 or I'll work my way around it,

237
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,340
 or I can go past the system.

238
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,820
 Or the third reason is because we think that

239
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,680
 someone who is giving us warnings

240
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,880
 is not doing it out of love and care,

241
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,640
 but actually to keep us away from fun and a good time.

242
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,840
 Like they don't want us to experience their withholding.

243
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,480
 They're trying to like keep us back.

244
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,040
 And for some, whatever reason, we're like,

245
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,360
 "I don't want to listen to you."

246
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,880
 But when I think about tonight

247
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,920
 and the warnings we see in this passage,

248
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
 like think about the person who is giving us

249
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
 these warnings in James chapter four,

250
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,960
 the literal half brother of Jesus,

251
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,560
 someone that you can trust,

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,840
 someone that walked with Jesus, ate with Jesus,

253
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,560
 talked to Jesus, learned from Jesus,

254
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,080
 watched Jesus die for you and me.

255
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,960
 And he's like, "You can trust me."

256
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
 He has no ulterior motive.

257
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,680
 Like he's not alive.

258
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,840
 He died for this stuff.

259
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
 So really think about that.

260
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,000
 Like, why would James take the time to die for this?

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,640
 Like, why would he give his life over

262
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,840
 to living a life for Jesus this kind of way?

263
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,760
 And it's because he loves us.

264
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,620
 Like he loves you and I enough

265
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,760
 to write down these things and go, "Trust me.

266
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,840
 I saw Jesus.

267
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,160
 I walked with Jesus.

268
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,920
 Take heed to these warnings."

269
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,740
 And tonight I'm even asking you

270
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,320
 as the messenger of God's word,

271
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,120
 as I'm just reading from the book of James,

272
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,720
 and guys, it's a weighty text.

273
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,680
 It's a hard text.

274
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,720
 It like, this thing shifts so many gears

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,960
 and goes so many different directions.

276
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
 I'm like getting whiplash.

277
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
 I'm like, "What's going on?"

278
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,680
 But as I stand up here, I'm asking you,

279
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,400
 "Hey, as we study James together, like, trust me.

280
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,280
 I love you.

281
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,560
 You guys are my people.

282
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,480
 You guys are my friends.

283
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,520
 We are in this together.

284
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,720
 We are in this walk together."

285
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,680
 And so may we all not be people who walk

286
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,080
 with a blind eye and deaf ears,

287
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,440
 but we take heed to warning,

288
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,600
 which is why tonight we're gonna look at

289
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,440
 three warnings to prevent us from ruining our lives.

290
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,920
 Three warnings to prevent you from ruining your life,

291
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,800
 found in James chapter four.

292
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,420
 So here we go, starting in verse one.

293
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,440
 "What is causing the quarrels and fights among you?

294
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,520
 Don't they come from the evil desires at war within you?

295
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,080
 You want what you don't have,

296
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,360
 so you scheme and kill to get it.

297
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,120
 You are jealous for what others have,

298
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,560
 but you can't get it,

299
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,000
 so you fight and wage war to take it away from them.

300
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,080
 Yet you don't have what you don't want

301
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,200
 because you don't ask God for it.

302
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,480
 And even when you ask,

303
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,480
 you don't get it because your motives are all wrong.

304
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,340
 You want only what will give you pleasure.

305
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,020
 You adulterers, don't you realize that friendship

306
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,400
 with the world makes you an enemy of God?

307
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,220
 I say it again.

308
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,480
 If you wanna be a friend of the world,

309
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,220
 you make yourself an enemy of God."

310
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,060
 That's heavy.

311
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,600
 "Do you think the scriptures have no meaning?

312
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
 They say that God is passionate,

313
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
 that the spirit he has placed within us

314
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,640
 should be faithful to him,

315
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,560
 and he gives grace generously.

316
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,800
 As the scriptures say,

317
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,520
 God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

318
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,320
 So humble yourselves before God,

319
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,400
 resist the devil and he will flee from you.

320
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,640
 Come close to God and God will come close to you.

321
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,400
 Wash your hands, you sinners, purify your hearts,

322
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,700
 for your loyalty is divided between God and the world.

323
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,640
 Let there be tears for what you have done.

324
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,400
 Let there be sorrow and deep grief.

325
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,120
 Let there be sadness instead of laughter,

326
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,320
 and gloom instead of joy.

327
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,020
 Humble yourselves before the Lord,

328
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,820
 and he will lift you up in honor."

329
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,740
 This is a lot.

330
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,500
 I mean, I was reading this like, "Oof, here we go."

331
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,840
 So warning number one found in James 4,

332
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,920
 verses one through 10 is trust God, not yourself.

333
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,500
 Simply put, warning number one,

334
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,420
 hey, always, always trust God,

335
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,200
 and never, never trust yourself.

336
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,240
 Look at verse one again.

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,700
 "What is causing the quarrels and fights among you?

338
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,420
 Don't they come from the evil desires at war within you?"

339
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,340
 What does he mean,

340
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,840
 this like these evil desires at war within you?

341
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,340
 Here's what he means.

342
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,980
 When you were born, you had something inside of you,

343
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,400
 we talk a lot about here called a sinful nature,

344
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,560
 a sin nature.

345
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,340
 That is a result of the fall of man

346
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,180
 all the way back in the beginning of the Bible,

347
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,000
 the first book, Genesis chapter three,

348
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,340
 when Adam and Eve chose to partake of the fruit,

349
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
 disobey God, they sinned.

350
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,740
 They brought sin into the world,

351
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,020
 and there was a curse of ramifications

352
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,660
 because of that sin that produced a sin nature

353
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,300
 in every human being.

354
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
 You and I don't have to earn it.

355
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,140
 We don't have to work for it.

356
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,660
 We have sin inside of us.

357
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,700
 We are born with it.

358
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,940
 We naturally crave to satisfy ourselves

359
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,500
 with the desires and the things of this world.

360
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,400
 And because of that sin nature,

361
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,700
 we go chasing after the world.

362
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,680
 But if you call yourself a Christian tonight,

363
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,780
 if you're here tonight,

364
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,720
 and you have surrendered your life over into God's hand

365
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,540
 and claimed yourself as a son and daughter of God,

366
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,220
 you no longer are identified by your sin,

367
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,100
 but you're now identified by the spirit in you.

368
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,420
 When you accept Jesus,

369
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,860
 he gives you something, a gift called the Holy Spirit.

370
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,700
 And that is now who he identifies you by,

371
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,300
 no longer your sin, but now the spirit.

372
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,620
 The problem is, is the spirit is light

373
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,460
 and your sin is dark.

374
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,060
 And the last time we all checked,

375
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,900
 light and darkness cannot coexist.

376
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,880
 So those two things are creating this friction inside of you.

377
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,400
 They're at constant war.

378
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,860
 When you are faced with that decision

379
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,820
 to not choose God and to choose sin,

380
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,140
 and when you're there sitting there faced with temptation,

381
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,700
 and you're like, I really want to do that,

382
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,320
 even though I know it's no good for me,

383
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,940
 there's this war that James is talking about

384
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,820
 going on inside of you where your spirit is like,

385
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,540
 hey, you know better, don't do it, trust God, not yourself.

386
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,540
 But your sin is like, do it, give in, do it, do it, do it.

387
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
 And that's the war that he's referring to.

388
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,560
 And when you choose to not trust God

389
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,100
 and listen to this warning and trust yourself,

390
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,060
 the product of that is you fight, he says,

391
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,020
 you quarrel, you search,

392
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,420
 you're full of jealousy and hatred and anger

393
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,380
 and frustration and stress and striving

394
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,100
 and anxiety and depression and exhaustion.

395
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,060
 And you're going and you're going and you're going.

396
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,220
 And you see this, what you think

397
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,900
 is the right desired outcome.

398
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,440
 You have this like image of what life should look like

399
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,420
 or what you should have or what you should achieve

400
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,300
 or what you want, whatever it is,

401
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,540
 your flesh is like, hey, I want that.

402
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,180
 And you think that you are the means to get your solution.

403
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,020
 Like you think that you are the solution to your problem.

404
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,980
 And so you do whatever it takes to get what you want

405
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,660
 because you trust yourself and not God.

406
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,820
 You think the problem is that you don't want,

407
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,940
 you don't have what you want.

408
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,500
 So you do all of these things that result in hurt

409
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
 and frustration to get it.

410
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,580
 But James would say, hey, that's not your problem.

411
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,080
 What does James articulate is the actual problem?

412
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,180
 He says in the end of verse two,

413
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,900
 you are jealous for others have, but you can't get it.

414
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,240
 So you fight and wage war to take it away from them.

415
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,780
 Yet you don't have, listen to this,

416
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,660
 yet you don't have what you want

417
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,020
 because you don't ask God for it.

418
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,180
 He goes even a step further and says in verse three,

419
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,400
 and even when you ask, you don't get it

420
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,540
 because your motives are all wrong.

421
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,620
 You want only what will give you pleasure.

422
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,260
 I think a lot of times you and I, if we're real with ourself

423
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,540
 when you think about your prayer life

424
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,300
 and you think about the things that you ask God for,

425
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
 how often is it to meet your agenda

426
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,660
 and not to bring him glory?

427
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,100
 Like how often on the end of your prayers

428
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,380
 is this secret motive in the back of your head

429
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,660
 that's like, yeah, God, like I'm coming to you

430
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,060
 and I'm talking to you, but you better do what I want.

431
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,920
 Like you better do what I'm asking.

432
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,680
 You better give me what I want.

433
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,960
 But James is saying, hey,

434
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,760
 that's not what being a Christian is.

435
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,600
 The definition of a Christian is someone who is Christ-like,

436
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,540
 someone who has surrendered their life to God's authority.

437
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,100
 And you don't trust yourself anymore.

438
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,420
 You don't want to satisfy yourself anymore.

439
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,660
 You wanna live for God and God alone.

440
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,780
 You wanna come to God and say,

441
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,460
 hey God, I trust you, whatever it is.

442
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,020
 I know I have this idea of what I think I want.

443
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,980
 I know I had this idea of success.

444
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,100
 I know I had this idea of a relationship.

445
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,580
 I know I had this perfect timeline set out

446
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,500
 and I think I want what I want, when I want it,

447
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 how I want it, but I trust you.

448
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,820
 He's a good father.

449
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,760
 He wants you and I, he wants his children to come

450
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,780
 and make the request.

451
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,580
 But that request can't be like this, like, okay, God,

452
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,680
 like, I guess, like, no, it has to be like this.

453
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,460
 Palms up, open-handed saying, God, I'm coming.

454
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,360
 I'm telling you what I want

455
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,300
 and I'm trusting you with the results.

456
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,680
 Your problem is, is yeah, you have wants.

457
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,180
 Yeah, your heart wants things.

458
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,900
 That's not bad though.

459
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,940
 Your actual problem is that you're not trusting God

460
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,300
 with the outcome of your wants.

461
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,140
 You're not trusting that he will actually give you

462
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,620
 what you need.

463
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,760
 And James would say, hey, here's the first warning,

464
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,060
 trust God, not yourself.

465
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,140
 I was with a friend this weekend

466
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,340
 and just practically in his life,

467
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,740
 he's just, he's memorizing the verse in Proverbs 3

468
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,000
 that says, trust in the Lord with all your heart,

469
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,060
 lean not on your own understandings

470
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,740
 and all your ways acknowledge him

471
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,820
 and he will make your path straight.

472
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,260
 And so when something happens in his life

473
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,660
 that goes against what he wanted,

474
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,660
 he takes a deep breath, he opens up his hands and says,

475
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,040
 Jesus, I trust you.

476
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,300
 And it's so simple, but I was like,

477
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,080
 dang, Matthew, that kind of hit.

478
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,300
 Like, that was good.

479
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,500
 So I wanted to do something.

480
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,300
 Everyone open your hands right now.

481
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,260
 Open your hands.

482
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,980
 So you're like, what's going on?

483
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
 This is kind of cold.

484
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,180
 (congregation laughing)

485
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,340
 If yoga can do it, so can we, all right?

486
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,460
 That's not good, sorry, take that back.

487
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,780
 So here we go, take a deep breath.

488
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,620
 Let's say, Jesus, I trust you, ready?

489
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,220
 Jesus, I trust you.

490
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,740
 Yes, it's that simple,

491
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,940
 but you got to believe it in every situation.

492
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,940
 Like, what if we woke up every day and said, God,

493
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,560
 whatever it is today, inhale, exhale, Jesus, I trust you.

494
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,520
 I trust you, not myself.

495
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,560
 Why can't we trust ourself?

496
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,260
 Because that war, that war that's going in.

497
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,060
 Jeremiah 17, nine through 10 puts it like this.

498
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,300
 The human heart is the most deceitful of all things.

499
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,780
 It's desperately wicked.

500
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,700
 Who really knows how bad it is?

501
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,780
 But I, the Lord, search all hearts

502
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,420
 and I examine secret motives.

503
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,300
 I give all people their due rewards

504
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,540
 according to what their actions deserve.

505
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,300
 You don't have to sit in this temptation

506
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,620
 or this like tension of going, man, I know I'm a war,

507
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,660
 like I'm in a war, my heart, my flesh, and then the spirit.

508
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,860
 And like, how do I know if this is like God's will

509
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,500
 or my will, and I'm so stressed out.

510
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,900
 And it's like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

511
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,900
 God is in control, open up your hands, ask him what you want,

512
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,500
 but trust him with the results, not yourself.

513
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,880
 Trust him.

514
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,200
 But a lot of times though, like, I know for me,

515
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,560
 trusting God can be really hard

516
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,440
 and it doesn't make a lot of sense.

517
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
 And there's things that you're like, well, I tried to trust

518
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,640
 him and he let me down or he didn't show up.

519
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,560
 And that caused a lot of pain and it caused a lot of hurt.

520
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,040
 I was thinking about a time in my life,

521
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,440
 a couple of summers ago where I, some of you,

522
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,040
 like, I don't know if you'll heard this or not,

523
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,920
 but like all my best friends,

524
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,360
 my senior year of college got married.

525
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,000
 And then they all do different times.

526
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,520
 They ended up pretty much in Austin together.

527
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,120
 They all kind of live in the same neighborhood.

528
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,920
 They're all in their second rounds of kids together.

529
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 And there was this season of just such loneliness

530
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,760
 for a summer where I'm like, God, like, what are you doing?

531
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
 I'm so lonely.

532
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,240
 I'm so behind.

533
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,420
 I'm missing out.

534
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,600
 I have FOMO.

535
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,440
 I'm over here.

536
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,260
 I'm 26.

537
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,220
 Like, what is going on?

538
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,640
 I want to find my person.

539
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,840
 I want to find my spouse.

540
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,200
 Don't you say that a spouse is a good thing.

541
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,500
 Like a man should not be alone.

542
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,440
 Like, where are you at, God?

543
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,040
 What are you doing?

544
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,080
 And over time, I didn't feel like he was answering me

545
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
 according to my time.

546
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,780
 And so I went on my own way in the name of like praying

547
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,520
 and like, you know, asking God, I was like, you know, God,

548
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,320
 like, you know what sounds good right now?

549
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
 My ex.

550
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,520
 We've all been there, okay?

551
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,720
 You get to that point, all right?

552
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,720
 And I'm like, God, I know.

553
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,480
 I know that you wanted that door to close.

554
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,920
 Like you're the God who wanted that door to close.

555
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,800
 And I knew deep, deep, deep down

556
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,640
 that God did not want me to go back to my ex.

557
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,200
 But I thought maybe if I would knock,

558
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,280
 he'd surprisingly open.

559
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
 So I knocked.

560
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,720
 That's, I'm just being real.

561
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,180
 And in the name of prayer and trust,

562
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,340
 I went around this roundabout way

563
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,440
 and I didn't listen to God.

564
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,040
 I listened to myself and I trusted myself and I knocked.

565
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,200
 She opened the door and she said, no, thank you.

566
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,160
 And she closed it.

567
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,680
 Praise God.

568
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:48,360
 But I say that, I say that because after that moment,

569
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,240
 I remember being so frustrated with not her,

570
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,080
 not myself, but God.

571
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,000
 Because I'm like, hello, what's wrong with you?

572
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,160
 She's a godly girl.

573
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
 Like the breakup wasn't bad.

574
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,040
 Like this could work out.

575
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
 Why don't you want this to work out?

576
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,640
 And he was like, because JD,

577
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,680
 I want you to see that I am enough.

578
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,360
 That I will never leave you nor forsake you.

579
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,620
 That I am with you.

580
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,220
 That I can meet the deepest longings of your soul

581
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,260
 in a way that a human being was never created to.

582
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,100
 That's my job.

583
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,320
 Trust me, not another person, not yourself,

584
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,580
 not another relationship.

585
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,280
 Trust me.

586
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,660
 And I had to learn in that season

587
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,420
 of what was such loneliness to surrender and trust God.

588
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,540
 I know a lot of us are there tonight.

589
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,860
 What do you need to stop putting your trust in yourself in

590
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,180
 and start trusting God?

591
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,020
 Do you need to listen to James's warning tonight?

592
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,280
 Because if you don't,

593
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
 it'll set you up for warning number two.

594
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,400
 Because when you choose to not trust God

595
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,920
 and not trust his heart,

596
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,680
 you will no longer see him as good.

597
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,840
 And what was once this amazing loving relationship

598
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,260
 will start to grow stale and dry

599
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,960
 and you'll go looking for love somewhere else.

600
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,640
 Which leads me to warning number two.

601
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,500
 Love God, not the world.

602
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,920
 Love God, not the world.

603
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,120
 Verse four, James takes his hard left turn

604
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,520
 and he's like, "You adulterers,

605
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,800
 "don't you realize that friendship with the world

606
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,760
 "makes you an enemy of God?

607
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,880
 "I say it again."

608
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,300
 I find that so interesting.

609
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,920
 I mean, this man is sitting here with a quill and a scroll

610
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,400
 and all of that, and he's writing.

611
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,980
 And then he's like, "You know what?

612
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,820
 "Double tap."

613
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,640
 They need to hear that again.

614
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
 I'm gonna write that down again.

615
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,800
 "I say it again.

616
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,700
 "If you wanna be a friend of the world,

617
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,480
 "you make yourself an enemy of God."

618
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,400
 And I don't know about y'all,

619
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
 but when I read the scriptures,

620
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,880
 a lot of times I like to see things that feel really good

621
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,120
 and be like, "Yes, Lord."

622
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,540
 Repost on the gram.

623
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,400
 But when I see verses like this,

624
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,360
 I'm like, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm."

625
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,260
 And I turn the page.

626
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,880
 'Cause I find myself deep down super convicted

627
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
 'cause I'm like, "An enemy?"

628
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,520
 Like friendship with the world to be an enemy of God,

629
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,920
 what does that mean?

630
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
 An adulterer?

631
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,860
 Like a cheater?

632
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,280
 Nobody likes a cheater.

633
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,040
 Nobody likes a cheater.

634
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,420
 And he says, "You're an adulterer."

635
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,920
 Why does he use that language?

636
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,380
 Like think about how adultery takes place.

637
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,820
 No one wakes up that's in love with their spouse

638
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,180
 and is in a good, healthy marriage

639
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,280
 and wakes up one day and is like, "You know what?

640
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,100
 "Today's the day I commit adultery on that person."

641
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
 No one does that.

642
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,500
 No one just wakes up and decides that.

643
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,620
 It's this slow, gradual process

644
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,060
 where you begin to forget about your love

645
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,740
 that you've committed your whole life to,

646
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,480
 that you said you and I ride or die 'til the end.

647
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,640
 You begin to look at that person,

648
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,460
 the things that once attracted you to them

649
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,480
 are kind of annoying.

650
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,160
 That laugh when she snorted, now you can't tolerate it.

651
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,720
 All these different things.

652
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,800
 You begin to fall out of love with this person.

653
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,840
 The things that brought you in

654
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,260
 are now kind of getting dry and stale,

655
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,240
 and you just don't feel the thing you once felt.

656
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,760
 The sex hasn't been as passionate.

657
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,160
 The things aren't that good.

658
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,000
 And so you start to slowly drift away,

659
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
 and it's like a slow, gradual process

660
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,040
 where you're arguing more, you're fighting more,

661
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,000
 and then one day you're at work,

662
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,200
 and you're at maybe like a happy hour function or something,

663
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,880
 or you're relaxing,

664
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,480
 and you meet a cute girl from the fifth floor.

665
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,740
 She's vibrant, she's new, she's fun, she makes you laugh.

666
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,640
 She doesn't snort.

667
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,720
 And at the end, you're like,

668
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,180
 "Hey, we have that function in the spring.

669
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
 "How about I get your number so we can talk about work?"

670
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,020
 And you get the number,

671
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,920
 and then you find yourself talking about work,

672
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,040
 forcing the conversation,

673
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,320
 and then now without your spouse knowing,

674
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,360
 you're talking to them, and you see it on Netflix.

675
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,160
 Like, they start talking, they start emotionally connecting,

676
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,800
 they find themselves alone at the office,

677
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,600
 and the next thing you know, boom, adultery's committed.

678
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,720
 And then this process begins

679
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,240
 where this person now has to live

680
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,820
 in this tension of two worlds,

681
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,420
 where they're a father or a wife, a mother.

682
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,080
 They have kids looking up to them, needing them,

683
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,220
 and yet there's this scandal going on,

684
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,880
 and they're living in both worlds.

685
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,120
 And you know how the story goes.

686
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,640
 Every single time, you can't do it.

687
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,280
 You can't be married to two people,

688
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,500
 you can't live two lives, you get caught.

689
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,580
 And James is saying, "Hey, warning.

690
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,160
 "When you begin to love the world

691
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,940
 "and fall in love with the world

692
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,760
 "and leave your first love,

693
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,680
 "that commitment you made with God,

694
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,220
 "it's gonna result in so much hurt, so much pain,

695
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,600
 "because that's what you and I do.

696
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,360
 "You have that camp high experience.

697
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,560
 "You all remember that moment

698
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,360
 "where you were at youth camp and you went with a friend

699
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,320
 "and you decided to surrender your life to God,

700
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,620
 "or you had that moment in college,

701
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,680
 "that night of amazing worship that hit you,

702
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,160
 "and you're like, 'I'm going all in.

703
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,600
 "'I'm going all in with you, God.

704
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,480
 "'Take my life.'

705
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,800
 "You found yourself at rock bottom,

706
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,440
 "and you're like, 'I'm never going back.

707
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,620
 "'I'm never going back.'

708
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,740
 "And you enter into this covenant with God,

709
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,000
 "this surrender to God, this like,

710
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,320
 "what James would say, like a marriage.

711
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,960
 "We are the bride of Christ as the church.

712
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,800
 "He is the bridegroom.

713
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,400
 "And you enter into this deep,

714
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,120
 "intimate relationship with God,

715
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,440
 "and then slowly but surely,

716
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,840
 "when he doesn't seem as good,

717
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,020
 "when he doesn't seem as faithful,

718
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,100
 "when you can't feel him,

719
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,940
 "when you're quiet times,

720
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,740
 "when you're reading the Bible and it just isn't hitting,

721
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,380
 "when your prayers feel like they're hitting the ceiling,

722
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,740
 "when you come here time and time again,

723
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,640
 "it's just stale and it's stagnant,

724
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,940
 "and you're like, 'This isn't as fun.

725
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,440
 "'I can't go out and do the things I once did.

726
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,460
 "'I've lost my friends.

727
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,540
 "'I've lost everything.'

728
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,380
 "And you slowly start to drift

729
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,060
 "into friendship with the world.

730
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,700
 "And you go back,

731
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,360
 "and you fall out of love with God

732
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,080
 "and back in love with the world.

733
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,800
 "And James would say,

734
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,440
 "'Hey, you're committing adultery on your first love.

735
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,980
 "'And if you wanna make yourself a friend of the world,

736
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,380
 "'you're knowingly making yourself an enemy of God.

737
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,300
 "'I'm warning you.

738
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,960
 "'I'm showing you.

739
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,680
 "'You cannot be a friend of the world

740
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
 "'and in love with God.'

741
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,700
 And you might be wondering right now,

742
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,080
 "What do you mean by a friend of the world?

743
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,820
 "What does it look like to be a friend of the world?

744
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,660
 "We always say around here,

745
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,600
 "Hey, you are the sum of your five closest friends."

746
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
 Like when you look at somebody,

747
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,880
 you are looking at the sum of their five closest friends,

748
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,460
 because when you hang out with people enough,

749
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,800
 you start to talk like them, act like them,

750
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,600
 walk like them, laugh like them, dress like them.

751
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,240
 You become the people that you hang out with.

752
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,080
 How you doing?

753
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,400
 And when you ask yourself,

754
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,660
 "Hey, what does it mean to be a friend of the world?"

755
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,720
 Well, in the same ways, I would look at a person and go,

756
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,960
 "Well, how do their friends dress?

757
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,200
 "How do their friends act?"

758
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,020
 I would look at you

759
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,640
 and you can just do a self-evaluation right now

760
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,100
 and ask yourself, "Hey, how do I dress?

761
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,920
 "How do I dress?

762
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,040
 "Do I dress how culture tells me to dress?"

763
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,760
 Like, fellas, do you wear things with like brands

764
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,200
 or to look a certain way

765
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,640
 to give off a certain image or confidence?

766
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,040
 Like, ladies, do you dress a certain way

767
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,440
 because the world says, "Hey, like celebrate you.

768
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,680
 "Life's all about you."

769
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,120
 Or, "Hey, I'm gonna reveal this

770
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,620
 "so guys want to come up to me

771
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,760
 "and seek, I want to get affirmation from them

772
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,580
 "and validation.

773
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,480
 "So I'm gonna show a little more skin than usual

774
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,080
 "when I go out on the weekends."

775
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,740
 Like, what dictates how you dress?

776
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,160
 Is it your friend, the world?

777
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,700
 Do you do it the world's way?

778
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,000
 Or what God would say is best

779
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
 as you honor Him with your body

780
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,080
 and with your clothes and with your decisions?

781
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,040
 How do you talk?

782
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,280
 Do you talk like the world says to talk?

783
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,480
 Are you one of those like hard users of the F word?

784
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,200
 Like, you're not talking about this people.

785
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,040
 You're like, "Ah, Lord."

786
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,840
 Do you talk inappropriately?

787
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,140
 Do you use vulgarness, slaying?

788
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,300
 Do you gossip?

789
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,500
 Do you complain?

790
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,900
 Do you just talk and talk and talk and never listen?

791
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,580
 Do you talk the world's way or God's way?

792
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,740
 How do you act?

793
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,860
 How do you live?

794
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,060
 What do you do?

795
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,220
 What do you listen to?

796
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,300
 What do you watch?

797
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,640
 How do you spend your time?

798
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,800
 How you spend your time says what you care about.

799
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,240
 And do you care about the things of the world

800
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,520
 or the things of God?

801
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,060
 Do a self-evaluation.

802
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,680
 Do the hard work to do the proper hard work

803
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,640
 and ask yourself right now, "Am I a friend of the world?"

804
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,600
 Because if you're a friend of God,

805
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,620
 if you're around other friends of God who are saying,

806
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,080
 "I don't care what the world says.

807
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,660
 We are gonna do it God's way

808
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,000
 because we have lived and experienced

809
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,480
 and seen that God's way is the best way."

810
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,060
 You should not look like the world.

811
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,200
 We have produced in the church today a lot of Christians

812
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,040
 that you cannot tell the difference

813
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,000
 between the church and the world.

814
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,320
 You could not tell the difference

815
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,200
 between Christ followers and world followers.

816
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
 They have blurred the lines and it looks a lot alike.

817
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,000
 And James is saying here is you cannot do both.

818
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,960
 You can't.

819
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,940
 And guys, when I read this, I mean, I was convicted

820
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,540
 'cause I thought about the songs I listened to,

821
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,860
 the Netflix shows I watched, the conversations I partake in,

822
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,200
 the things that I do.

823
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,240
 And I'm like, "Man, I don't wanna be a friend of the world.

824
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,700
 I wanna be in love with God.

825
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,860
 I wanna do things God's way.

826
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,300
 I wanna look different.

827
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,900
 I wanna be set apart.

828
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,420
 I wanna walk like God calls me to walk

829
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,980
 because I love Him and He loves me."

830
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,540
 So take heed of the warning.

831
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,740
 Love God, don't love the world.

832
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,380
 Don't be an adulterer.

833
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,300
 Don't cheat on your first love.

834
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,220
 Stay in love with God, not the world.

835
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:54,140
 The last warning,

836
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,340
 because here's was a, just before we get to that,

837
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,780
 a verse, verse five.

838
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,180
 I thought this was so interesting.

839
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,700
 It says, "Do you think the scriptures have no meaning?

840
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,340
 They say that God is passionate,

841
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,540
 that the spirit He has placed within us

842
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,140
 should be faithful to Him."

843
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,620
 A lot of your translations there where it says passion,

844
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,260
 they say that God is passionate.

845
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,860
 Your probably translates to jealous.

846
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,060
 Like God is jealous for us.

847
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,060
 And what a wild concepts that we commit adultery on God.

848
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,740
 We cheat on God with the world.

849
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,540
 And His response, like our response to like a cheater

850
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,540
 is like divorce, rebuke, push away, exile, cancel.

851
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,740
 Everyone around you is like, how dare they?

852
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,160
 They pushed them, they unfollowed them,

853
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,180
 they get them out of their life.

854
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,720
 But God's response is jealousy.

855
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,820
 He has this, like how God can have a righteous anger.

856
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,860
 He has a righteous jealousy.

857
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,360
 And why is that?

858
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,020
 Though we abuse His love,

859
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,980
 though we go to the world and forsake Him,

860
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,520
 why would God be jealous in one us after all we do?

861
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,000
 And after we cheat on Him time and time again?

862
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,400
 It's because He wants us.

863
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,240
 He's like, "Hey, that's mine.

864
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,620
 That's my son.

865
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,480
 That's my daughter.

866
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,660
 That's my child."

867
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,940
 And He wants a better way for us.

868
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,540
 He wants a better life for us.

869
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,460
 He wants life and life to the full.

870
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,380
 And He's like, "I love you too much to leave you out there.

871
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,540
 I'm not divorcing.

872
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,660
 I'm not canceling.

873
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,740
 I'm not going anywhere.

874
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,060
 I'm jealous for you.

875
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,660
 I want you come back to me.

876
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,840
 Come back."

877
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,140
 And some of you tonight,

878
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,820
 as you've done your self-evaluation,

879
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,920
 you might be like, "Oh, I've been a friend

880
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,460
 with the world, therefore I've been an enemy of God."

881
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,580
 And the invitation tonight is, "Hey, He's jealous for you.

882
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,300
 He wants you back.

883
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,320
 So come back."

884
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,640
 Come back.

885
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,360
 But when you come as you are to God

886
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
 in the midst of all your,

887
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,480
 maybe the shame and the guilt that you feel,

888
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,700
 and you're like, "I'm so sorry, God,

889
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
 for leaving and abandoning you."

890
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,240
 And you come back to Him.

891
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,500
 Yes, He invites you to come as you are,

892
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,000
 but He does not want you,

893
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,840
 'cause if He loves you,

894
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,720
 He does not want you to stay as you are.

895
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,960
 He wants you to change.

896
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,240
 No one goes back to a relationship

897
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,180
 and is like, "I'm so sorry I cheated on you.

898
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,720
 Let me just continue to cheat on you,

899
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,320
 and cheat on you, and cheat on you."

900
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
 That's not love.

901
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,940
 You never came back.

902
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,960
 So you come back and you acknowledge who you are

903
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,000
 and who you've been,

904
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
 but then, because you recognize that He wants you back

905
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,000
 and that love for you,

906
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,960
 you have no choice but to wanna change out of love for Him.

907
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,560
 You don't change to get His love,

908
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,400
 you change because you've been loved.

909
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,660
 And when you do that,

910
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,360
 you have no choice but to wanna lift Him higher,

911
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,080
 and higher, and higher in your life

912
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,040
 which would be warning number three,

913
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,120
 exalt God and humble yourself.

914
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,360
 Exalt God, humble yourself.

915
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,540
 What do I mean by exalt?

916
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,380
 I just mean to elevate Him in your life as Lord and as King,

917
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,960
 that you go to Him with decisions,

918
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
 you go to Him with your love,

919
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,520
 you go to Him with the things that you cherish,

920
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,660
 the things that you want,

921
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,400
 you lift Him higher above everything else in your life.

922
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,720
 He gets more time from you,

923
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,480
 He gets all your affections from you,

924
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,680
 He gets everything.

925
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,080
 You surrender yourself to Him and you exalt Him,

926
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,980
 and then you humble yourself,

927
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,720
 you lower yourself and you're like,

928
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,260
 God, I need you, I need you.

929
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,040
 That's what humility causes you to do.

930
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,960
 And I think most of us,

931
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,200
 why James has to warn us

932
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,160
 because we spend our young adult years

933
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,680
 doing everything we can to exalt ourselves.

934
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
 Like think about it,

935
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,000
 even the best Christians in the room,

936
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,640
 you want the resume, you want the influence,

937
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,960
 you want the followers, you want the sidearm candy,

938
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,300
 you want all these different things

939
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,880
 to raise yourself up higher

940
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,720
 'cause you wanna exalt yourself.

941
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,680
 But when you recognize God's love for you

942
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,140
 in the midst of your sin, He calls you back to Him.

943
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,760
 You wanna come and then you wanna change,

944
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,520
 you wanna lift Him higher and lower yourself.

945
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,460
 Romans 6 says this,

946
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,340
 "Well then, should we keep on sinning

947
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,080
 "so that God can show us more and more

948
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,300
 "of His wonderful grace?

949
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,880
 "Of course not.

950
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,520
 "Since we have died to sin,

951
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,560
 "how can we continue to live in it?"

952
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,540
 Read James 6, it says,

953
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,940
 "And He gives grace generously,

954
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,220
 "as the Scriptures say,

955
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,120
 "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."

956
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,180
 So James is articulating,

957
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,700
 hey, you've cheated on God, you've ran from God,

958
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,500
 you recognize that He's jealous for you,

959
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,620
 He wants you back, you come back,

960
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,320
 He gives you grace generously.

961
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,580
 But the problem with that is I think a lot of us,

962
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,380
 we abuse that grace.

963
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,220
 We abuse God's love.

964
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,540
 When you're faced with temptation,

965
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,420
 you're rationalizing with yourself,

966
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,980
 you're like, "Well, I could do this.

967
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,240
 "I could do this bad thing.

968
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,180
 "I could forsake God and satisfy myself

969
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,920
 "because grace, grace abounds.

970
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,300
 "More love, I get to experience more grace."

971
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,380
 And that verse we just read in Romans says,

972
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,980
 hey, so should we keep on sinning

973
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,020
 so we can get more grace?

974
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,740
 Absolutely not, that's ludicrous, that's crazy.

975
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,740
 How can someone who says they died to sin still live in it?

976
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,440
 What does he mean by that?

977
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,980
 Well, he's referring to our parallel

978
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,040
 with the story of the gospel, the good news.

979
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,060
 That when Jesus came and left heaven

980
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,860
 and came down to earth because of our sin

981
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,380
 and its separation between us and God,

982
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,260
 he paid our penalty, our price on the cross.

983
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,820
 He was the perfect sacrifice because he never sinned

984
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,860
 knowing that you and I would, and he hung on the cross.

985
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,020
 And he died, they buried him, and he rose again.

986
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,140
 And he defeated sin, he conquered sin.

987
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,500
 And now we get to experience freedom.

988
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,180
 We get to experience grace.

989
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,860
 We get to experience love.

990
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,380
 And I think a lot of us like to experience the risen Lord.

991
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,020
 We like to be the same with Christ

992
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,940
 and experience freedom and grace and love,

993
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,940
 but you can't experience the benefits of the resurrection

994
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,720
 without sitting in the reality of the death.

995
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,980
 Like so many of you want to experience,

996
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,540
 like we want to experience,

997
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,620
 I want to experience grace and love from God,

998
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,420
 but I don't want to sit in the reality of why I need it,

999
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,960
 of my sin,

1000
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,260
 because I continue to disobey him

1001
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,780
 and go back to the world and trust myself.

1002
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,780
 I don't take heed of these warnings.

1003
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,580
 And so Paul and James, what they're saying here is,

1004
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,900
 "Hey, when you come back to God,

1005
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,500
 "there should be a change in you."

1006
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,380
 Like I said, you get to come as you are,

1007
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,860
 but there's nothing loving that would allow God

1008
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,420
 to want you to stay as you are.

1009
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,460
 There should be a change in you

1010
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,420
 because of the realization of his love for you.

1011
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,380
 And so how does that change come to be?

1012
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,340
 Well, like he lays it out,

1013
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,860
 like he closes out the section,

1014
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,100
 which is going verse by verse,

1015
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,860
 of when you recognize God's love for you

1016
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,720
 and it produces that change in you,

1017
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,500
 when you take heed of these warnings,

1018
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,660
 when you don't trust God,

1019
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,620
 or when you don't trust yourself and you trust God,

1020
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,680
 when you don't love the world and you love God,

1021
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,900
 when you begin, because of his love for you,

1022
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,120
 exalting him and lowering yourself,

1023
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,780
 the changes, they look like this.

1024
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,620
 What does he say?

1025
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,780
 "Humble yourselves before God."

1026
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,820
 What does that mean?

1027
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,700
 Like what I've been saying, it's like putting a posture,

1028
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,860
 it's getting up every day and like Matthew saying,

1029
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,200
 "Jesus, I trust you."

1030
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,860
 Creating that posture of dependency

1031
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,660
 where you get down on your knees and you say,

1032
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,820
 "God, I need you, I want you.

1033
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,840
 "I invite you into my life every day.

1034
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,420
 "I need you, I want you, I trust you,

1035
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,480
 "I need you, I want you, I trust you.

1036
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,180
 "I have no good apart from you.

1037
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,840
 "I'm gonna try and try again to make life about me,

1038
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,340
 "but I wanna decrease, I want you to increase.

1039
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,740
 "I wanna exalt you above everything that I have."

1040
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,380
 And then he goes on to say, "Hey, resist the devil

1041
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,960
 "and he will flee from you.

1042
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,420
 "Don't forget that you have the power to resist the devil.

1043
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,360
 "And I know the temptation seems hard.

1044
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,100
 "I know the sin seems great.

1045
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,560
 "I know it seems fun and you'll get a quick fix

1046
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,400
 "and a short time satisfaction.

1047
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,780
 "But I know that you also know

1048
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,320
 "on the end of that sin is guilt and shame

1049
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,700
 "and you know you don't wanna do it,

1050
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,840
 "but it feels so heavy and so hard.

1051
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,280
 "But you can resist the devil

1052
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,700
 "because you have the power

1053
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,380
 "of the Holy Spirit inside of you.

1054
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,540
 "You can say, no, I resist you.

1055
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,740
 "I'm not giving in.

1056
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,240
 "I'm choosing God, I'm loving God, I'm trusting God.

1057
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,780
 "I'm taking heed of these warnings and I'm not giving in.

1058
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,220
 "I resist you, Satan."

1059
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,580
 And it says, he will flee.

1060
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,700
 He'll flee.

1061
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,880
 And when he's gone,

1062
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,680
 you now get to come in and come near to God.

1063
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,760
 That's amazing.

1064
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,800
 That God would want adulterers, cheaters,

1065
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,660
 lovers of the world to come near to him.

1066
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,120
 Because of Jesus, we get to come near to God.

1067
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,040
 And what's even crazier is he then comes near to us.

1068
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,200
 When we exalt him, he exalts us.

1069
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,000
 He comes near to us and begins to listen, meet our needs,

1070
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,680
 give us our wants because we are choosing

1071
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,400
 to make him Lord of our lives.

1072
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,440
 He says, wash your hands, purify your hearts.

1073
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,720
 He's talking about confess, be changed,

1074
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,780
 be transformed, be healed.

1075
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,120
 Let your life begin to change.

1076
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,000
 Put off the old self of sin

1077
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,600
 and put on a new life with Christ.

1078
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,960
 Wash away.

1079
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,160
 By the blood of Jesus, be pure, be clean before him.

1080
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,440
 And then this is the part that I was like,

1081
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,560
 man, this is like a Debbie Downer.

1082
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,680
 Like to end on this is like, really James?

1083
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,080
 Here's what he tells us to do.

1084
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,320
 Let there be tears for what you have done.

1085
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,240
 Let there be sorrow and deep grief,

1086
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,240
 sadness instead of laughter, gloom instead of joy.

1087
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,400
 And I was reading that, I was alone in a room

1088
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,400
 and I was prepping and I read that.

1089
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,840
 And I'm like, but wait, I thought that like following God

1090
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,960
 and like grace and freedom and like love

1091
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,320
 was supposed to be just as happy life of blessings

1092
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,640
 and favor and like happiness all the time

1093
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,880
 and joy all the time.

1094
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,400
 And like, I thought if I was obedient to God,

1095
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,640
 like that would be the case.

1096
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,240
 And the reality is,

1097
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:03,200
 the reality is, is there needs to be a season, a time

1098
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,240
 where before we sit in the weight of God's love for us,

1099
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,320
 we sit in the weight of our need of God's love.

1100
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,760
 And I think that we don't like that.

1101
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,360
 Like I think that we like to laugh.

1102
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,680
 I think we like joy.

1103
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,160
 I think we like happiness.

1104
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,880
 We like feeling good.

1105
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,240
 And that's okay.

1106
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,920
 But you know what will make that laughter sweeter,

1107
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,240
 that joy longer,

1108
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,120
 is when you truly take time to understand

1109
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,560
 how you have access to it.

1110
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,560
 When you take time to sit in the weight of your sin.

1111
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,600
 And guys, as I was like writing all of this stuff,

1112
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,360
 here's what I thought about.

1113
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,840
 Like the Bible talks about how it was our sin

1114
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,120
 that put Jesus on the cross.

1115
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,720
 Like he did it for you, you, mine sin,

1116
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,440
 like because of his love for us,

1117
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,680
 that while we were sinners, he died for us.

1118
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,640
 And it says that by his stripes,

1119
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,200
 like by the whips on his back,

1120
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,360
 you and I are healed from our sin.

1121
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:11,720
 And I was thinking about how when I read these warnings,

1122
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,840
 and it says, hey, you cannot love the world and God,

1123
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,440
 and yet JD, you love the world,

1124
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,760
 and then you try to love God.

1125
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,960
 And hey, if you continue to sin,

1126
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,560
 like it's gonna bring you further from God.

1127
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,840
 And like you're committing adultery

1128
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,760
 and all these different things.

1129
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,240
 I'm like, why would I do that?

1130
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,080
 And right now, I want you to think about the person

1131
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,000
 in your life that loves you the most.

1132
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,680
 Like think about the person in your life

1133
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,040
 that loves you the most,

1134
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,680
 and how they would do anything for you,

1135
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,120
 how they would die for you.

1136
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:48,400
 And imagine you walking up and hitting that person,

1137
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,320
 spitting on that person, whipping that person.

1138
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,960
 We don't like that.

1139
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,320
 I don't like that.

1140
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,400
 I think about my dad.

1141
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,920
 I would never do that to my dad.

1142
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,760
 He loves me.

1143
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:12,280
 And then I was prepping and I was like, God loves me.

1144
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,520
 Jesus loves me so much more than my dad.

1145
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,840
 And James is saying, hey, you need to sit

1146
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,560
 in the weight of your sins and let it produce tears

1147
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,800
 and be okay with mourning and grieving

1148
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,840
 how you've turned your back against God.

1149
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,360
 And I sat, I sat in it.

1150
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:43,120
 I thought about my sin and the stripes on Jesus' back

1151
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,780
 and the price that he paid for me.

1152
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,140
 And I thought about how some of us tonight

1153
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,020
 will hear these warnings and still not listen

1154
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,580
 and still not believe that God is enough

1155
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,260
 and that he's worth it and that Jesus died for you

1156
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,260
 and he's worth it.

1157
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,140
 And it was just more stripes.

1158
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:11,620
 And then when I sat in that,

1159
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,580
 I then was forced to then sit in the weight of love,

1160
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,820
 of grace.

1161
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,300
 God was like, hey, hey, it's okay.

1162
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,900
 This is why he died.

1163
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,060
 There's no greater love than this,

1164
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,460
 that a man would lay down his life for his friend.

1165
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,000
 This is why he died, so that you could be free.

1166
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,900
 And my mourning turned into joy.

1167
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,260
 My tears turned into laughter.

1168
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,500
 My sadness turned into happiness.

1169
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,540
 I was like, thank you, God.

1170
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,300
 Thank you, God.

1171
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,380
 (gentle music)

1172
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,480
 For the way that you gave me out of my sin

1173
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,340
 and for bearing my sin on the cross that I could be free.

1174
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,420
 And tonight, I wish that everything in me,

1175
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,620
 I could end with this hope-filled message of like,

1176
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,940
 so let's go and be free.

1177
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,560
 But as I was wrestling with God

1178
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,580
 of how to close this message,

1179
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,180
 I think we need to actually sit,

1180
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:13,340
 do that self-evaluation and sit in the weight of our sin.

1181
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,420
 Mourn, appropriately mourn and grieve our sin.

1182
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,540
 Not stay in it, but sit in it for a little bit.

1183
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,500
 And let that produce obedience,

1184
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,500
 trust, love, produce change.

1185
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,020
 People that once neglected warning,

1186
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,920
 we now wanna listen to it because Jesus paid for our sin.

1187
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,180
 And so tonight, if that's you,

1188
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,620
 if you're going, hey, I've been committing adultery,

1189
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,980
 I've been running from God and I wanna run back to him.

1190
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,620
 Don't wait.

1191
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,620
 As we respond in worship, just take a moment,

1192
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,660
 sit in it and go, God, I need you.

1193
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,220
 I need you, exalt him, humble yourself.

1194
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,060
 Say, God, I need you.

1195
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,880
 Open up your hands, say, Jesus, I trust you.

1196
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,940
 What have you not been trusting him with?

1197
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,840
 Say, Jesus, I trust you.

1198
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,300
 If you've been loving the world and not loving him,

1199
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,140
 say, God, I'm coming back.

1200
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,540
 I love you, I love you.

1201
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,900
 Thank you for loving me, I'm coming back.

1202
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,140
 And when you come back, say, and I wanna lift you higher.

1203
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,500
 And I wanna be obedient and I wanna respond.

1204
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,740
 Lay down your life, give him your life

1205
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,380
 because he gave his life for you.

1206
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:28,920
 And let that change you, let it change you.

1207
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,740
 Take heed to James' warning.

1208
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,140
 Don't walk out of here the same.

1209
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,940
 Hear the warning and change, respond,

1210
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,140
 trust, love, and exalt God, humble yourselves.

1211
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,020
 We're gonna take a time right now just to do that.

1212
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,820
 And I don't know if this might be weird for some of you,

1213
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,140
 like if you need to get on your knees

1214
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,820
 and turn in your chair, get on your knees.

1215
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,740
 If you need to just open up your hands

1216
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,060
 and say, I trust you, open up your hands.

1217
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,460
 If you need to grab some people and get around and pray,

1218
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,100
 do that, whatever it looks like.

1219
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,660
 But tonight, I think God is calling the people

1220
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,860
 in this room and watching to sit and mourn

1221
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,980
 how our generation has turned their back on God

1222
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,100
 time and time again.

1223
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,180
 But the beauty of it is because of the gospel,

1224
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,460
 we then get to be exalted.

1225
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,100
 God exalts us, his children, we get to worship him.

1226
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,060
 So let's take a time to do that.

1227
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:23,060
 Father, I know that the weight of our sin

1228
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:28,700
 is heavy here tonight.

1229
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,060
 I know that the weight of my sin is heavy here tonight.

1230
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,380
 And I know that we need you.

1231
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,100
 I know that time and time again, we choose not to trust you.

1232
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,500
 We choose not to love you.

1233
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,780
 We love the world.

1234
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,800
 We exalt ourselves.

1235
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,060
 We don't exalt you.

1236
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:49,740
 So I pray that this would be a moment where we come back,

1237
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,580
 where we lay ourselves down and we say, God, I'm sorry.

1238
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,660
 God, I need you.

1239
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,740
 God, I trust you.

1240
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,180
 God, I humble myself.

1241
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,300
 God, I wanna honor you with my life.

1242
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,000
 I don't wanna continue to cheat on you.

1243
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,900
 I don't wanna continue to be a friend of the world

1244
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,300
 and try to love you and do both.

1245
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,300
 I'm done doing both.

1246
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,380
 I'm done being exhausted.

1247
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,500
 I trust you, I love you, I'm coming back.

1248
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,140
 And that we sit in our need for you.

1249
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,680
 And that we stand and sing with confidence

1250
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,980
 because of your love for us.

1251
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,080
 That you'd send your son down to die for us.

1252
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,640
 Thank you, Jesus.

1253
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,440
 Thank you, Jesus.

1254
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,200
 You are who we bow down to,

1255
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,200
 who we humble ourselves before and exalt tonight.

1256
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,480
 May he be glorified.

1257
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,940
 In the name that I pray, amen.
