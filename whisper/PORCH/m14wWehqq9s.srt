 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:26,160
 All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room, everybody

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,600
 tuning in online.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,720
 And at the 14--

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,760
 thank you--

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,360
 PortsLive locations, we are continuing this series.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
 We're all freaking out, and why we don't have to,

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,720
 talking about really crucial topics of mental health,

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,840
 anxiety, soon depression, stress,

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,080
 and what God has to say about these crucial topics.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,680
 So tonight, we're going to look at what

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,200
 I think is one of the key contributors

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,080
 to the experience of being robbed of peace

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,120
 and experiencing anxiety and stress and panic.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,560
 And to do so, I'm going to start by showing y'all a picture of what

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,680
 was one of the first clocks in Europe.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,240
 Now, you look at that, and you wonder, where is the clock?

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,700
 Because it doesn't look like there's any part of that clock.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,320
 This was one of the first clock towers ever erected,

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,400
 or the first clock tower ever erected in Milan, Italy.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,620
 Shout out to everybody who got a big Milan porch group out there.

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,760
 And that's not true at all.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,800
 But this clock was erected and was transformational

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,440
 in the relationship that the West or Europe and eventually America

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,200
 would have with time itself.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,920
 But here's what's crazy about this clock.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,720
 Like I said, there's no face.

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,680
 There's no dial.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,680
 It was a clock that was programmed to beat every hour.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,560
 And the number of times that it beat throughout the city of Milan

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,360
 would indicate the hour of day that it was.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
 So at 1 o'clock in the morning, it would beat one time.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,400
 At midnight, it would be 24 times.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,480
 At 2, it would beat 2.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,040
 At 6, it would beat 6.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,800
 And here's why this was transformational.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,280
 Prior to this, and eventually after it was erected in Milan,

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,800
 the clock spread like wildfire, and specifically

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
 a public clock in town spread all throughout Europe

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,600
 and became a normal part of everyday life.

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,440
 But imagine how transformative that would have been.

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
 Prior to this time, the relationship people had with time

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
 was all based around the sun.

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,960
 In other words, sun goes up, time to get up and start the day.

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,480
 Sun goes down, not exactly sure what time it is.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,000
 Is it 7?

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,400
 Is it 8?

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
 It doesn't matter.

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,160
 There's no electricity.

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,440
 We're all going to bed anyways.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
 And the clock introduced a new relationship

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,080
 where no longer was society or humanity governed by the sun.

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,480
 One writer wrote that it was an act of rebellion by saying,

54
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,760
 we are no longer living underneath the jurisdiction

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
 of the sun.

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,520
 Now we have been liberated.

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,000
 And now if we want to get up and meet at 6 in the morning,

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,360
 we can go meet because we got six drumbeats that just happened.

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,040
 And that began to spread like crazy.

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,880
 And the pluses and minuses of living

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,760
 in a world that can be governed by the 9 to 5, 24 hours a day,

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,600
 7 days a week began to be a part of everyday normal life.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,520
 And then fast forward a few centuries later

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,080
 and something was introduced called the light bulb.

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
 And our relationship previously to the light bulb,

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
 even though the clock was around, we know it's 7 o'clock,

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,720
 but you light a fire and that's basically what you do.

68
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,640
 Everybody's camping essentially for all of life.

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,280
 And then we get something called electricity and the light bulb.

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,320
 And we're able to say, man, just give the middle finger basically

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
 to the sun and say, we don't even need you anymore.

72
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,760
 We can work all the way into the night.

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,680
 And society and culture continued

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,160
 to get faster and faster and work longer and longer.

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,560
 And the modern age began.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,680
 And we live in a time in world history

77
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,840
 that is relatively new, speaking,

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,080
 where our understanding and having a clock is just

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,040
 a normal part of everyday life and electricity

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
 and doing things into the evening.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,000
 I mean, the porch could not have existed 100 years ago

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,040
 because or 150 years ago because of electricity.

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,960
 It's pretty crazy to think about.

84
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,920
 And yet all of that transformation

85
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,640
 has also increased something in our society called stress,

86
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,480
 where despite the fact that now the blessing of being

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,240
 able to work and work and work has also come with the curse

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,840
 of being able to work and work and work

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,680
 and take all of the side effects that come along with that.

90
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,480
 America as a country is one of the most overworked nations

91
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,000
 on Earth.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
 If there was a gold medal for most rested,

93
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
 America would not come close.

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,720
 There are more unused vacation days for the average American

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
 than any other country on Earth.

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,200
 86% of men and 67% of women work over 40 hours a week.

97
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,360
 It is one of the most highly overworked group

98
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,120
 on the planet that takes the least amount of vacations

99
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,680
 and experience some of the highest levels of anxiety,

100
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,800
 stress, and depression.

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,300
 Here's something further that's crazy.

102
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,480
 This was crazy, man.

103
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
 Just give them this for free.

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,960
 Until about the 1920s, the term that we use,

105
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,800
 if you talk to your friends, probably today,

106
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,560
 and you ask like, man, how's your day?

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
 How's life going?

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,900
 You're catching up.

109
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,040
 They'll be like, good, just under a lot of stress.

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,560
 Did you know that phrase would not have made sense

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,800
 100 years ago?

112
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,560
 I'm talking like the beginning of the war in '20s.

113
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,280
 Nobody would have understood what do you even mean

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,440
 I'm really stressed?

115
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,320
 Why do I say that?

116
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,740
 Because prior to the 1920s, the use of the word stress

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,680
 never was used to describe an emotional experience

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,080
 or a person's life or a season that they were in.

119
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,960
 It wasn't personal.

120
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,160
 It was always physics.

121
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,120
 In other words, stress would have been a term

122
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
 that was used in the world of physics

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,040
 when someone would see maybe a metal beam

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,340
 or see some object having weight placed on it

125
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,660
 and a beam would have been stressed out

126
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,300
 when it reached the breaking point.

127
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,720
 Does that make sense?

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 And it's almost as though somebody saw a beam

129
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
 like, man, it's about to snap,

130
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,840
 and I feel like that's my life.

131
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,920
 And they began to say, I feel so stressed out,

132
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,520
 and it caught on like wildfire,

133
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,160
 and now we say it all the time.

134
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,120
 You, of course, understand.

135
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,160
 Somebody says I'm stressed, you're like, oh, man, same.

136
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,280
 Who's not?

137
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,880
 'Cause we understand.

138
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,860
 And yet, one of the key contributors

139
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,300
 to you having anxiety or key things

140
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,320
 that will inhibit you from experiencing the peace

141
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,740
 that God wants to mark your life

142
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,920
 is stress, being overwhelmed, panicked.

143
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
 And so we're gonna look at some of the truths

144
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,980
 that God has given in a story

145
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,940
 that was recorded thousands of years ago

146
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,960
 because God is passionate.

147
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,220
 He does not want that to mark your life.

148
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,480
 He wants you to experience peace,

149
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,200
 this ability to catch your breath,

150
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,560
 to not feel like, man, I'm constantly overwhelmed,

151
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,400
 but to feel peace.

152
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,360
 And we're gonna do so by looking at a story

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
 that points to some of the sources of stress

154
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,700
 that are still common today,

155
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,020
 some of the side effects that,

156
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,460
 anytime stress is present in our life,

157
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,780
 are often present, and then the solution

158
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,000
 to experiencing a life that's not marked by stress,

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,680
 but by peace through our relationship with Christ.

160
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,780
 So we're gonna look in Luke, chapter 10.

161
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,240
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Luke, chapter 10.

162
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,400
 It's a very famous story.

163
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,820
 If you grew up in church, you probably heard it,

164
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,400
 but you may have misunderstood, actually,

165
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,360
 the profound teaching Jesus gives us.

166
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,400
 It's Jesus's interaction with two ladies,

167
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,600
 sisters named Mary and Martha,

168
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,640
 who were two of Jesus's closest friends.

169
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,200
 They had another sibling named Lazarus.

170
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,120
 And Mary and Martha were two disciples

171
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,620
 who knew Jesus, ran with him.

172
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,200
 And in the interaction they have with Jesus,

173
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,480
 we're given some of the glimpses into our own experience

174
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,440
 and interaction with stress

175
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,620
 and what Jesus has to say about it.

176
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,120
 So I'm gonna read through this story really quick,

177
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,680
 and then we'll point through the sources,

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,200
 side effects, and solution.

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,840
 It says this in verse 38.

180
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,200
 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way,

181
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,140
 he came to a village where a woman named Martha

182
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,380
 opened up her home to him, invited him in.

183
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,880
 She had a sister called Mary,

184
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,880
 who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.

185
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,340
 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations

186
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,380
 that had to be made.

187
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,940
 She came to him, Jesus sitting in the living room,

188
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,060
 all the disciples around, Mary sitting there,

189
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,540
 and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister

190
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,220
 "has left me to do all the work by myself?

191
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
 "Tell her to help me."

192
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,780
 "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered,

193
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,940
 "you are worried and upset,

194
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,600
 "or troubled," your translation may have,

195
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,900
 "about many things, but few things are needed,

196
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,040
 "or indeed only one.

197
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
 "Mary has chosen what is better,

198
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,840
 "and it will not be taken away from her."

199
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,560
 So pretty simple story.

200
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,240
 Jesus goes into his town, this village.

201
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,280
 There's a woman named Martha.

202
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
 She owns a home.

203
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,360
 She invites Jesus in, and she's gonna whip something up.

204
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,640
 She's getting hummus and chopping up tomatoes

205
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
 and doing whatever she's doing in the kitchen,

206
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,960
 and she begins to feel overwhelmed.

207
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,900
 And Mary, her freeloader sister,

208
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,820
 'cause it's not Mary's house, it's Martha's house.

209
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,940
 Martha's paying the mortgage, and Mary's just in there,

210
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,420
 sitting like a freeloader at the feet of Jesus,

211
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,140
 and she comes to Jesus and says,

212
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,660
 "Man, hook your sister up.

213
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,860
 "You're just gonna leave me out here,

214
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,980
 "make me chop up all of the olives in here by myself?

215
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,100
 "Can you help me out and tell my sister to come help me?"

216
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,440
 And Jesus says, "Man, you are overwhelmed

217
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,420
 "and worried and stressed,"

218
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,540
 and he addresses something going on on the inside.

219
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,060
 And he gets to something incredibly profound

220
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,160
 that we'll cover here in a second,

221
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,480
 but the first I did wanna talk about

222
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,560
 is some of the sources of stress,

223
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,240
 because the sources of stress that Martha exhibits

224
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,880
 are some of the same sources that we all exhibit.

225
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
 I mean, you gotta feel it.

226
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,060
 Like, here's my hot take on Martha.

227
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,240
 Martha gets a bad rap.

228
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,720
 I think if you lived in the first century

229
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
 and you were a guy, you wanted to date and marry Martha.

230
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
 If Chris Harrison was around,

231
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,280
 well, I guess he's not around anymore anyways,

232
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,600
 but if Chris Harrison or Bachelor was around back then,

233
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,880
 and they were looking for a bachelorette,

234
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,720
 I think Martha is at the top of the list.

235
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,140
 She's a go-getter, she's responsible, she owns a house.

236
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,340
 Mary is some hippie on the floor,

237
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,960
 and Martha's in there cooking dinner.

238
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,660
 She's making a meal.

239
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,000
 I mean, this is a girl that there's a lot to respect about.

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,100
 And yet, with all that respectability also came

241
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,260
 that she was carrying a lot of stress,

242
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,380
 particularly even stress that was attacking

243
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,220
 and impacting her relationship with Jesus,

244
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,780
 the Son of God sitting in her living room.

245
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,580
 And so I wanna walk through a few of the sources of stress,

246
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,660
 because I think they're so parallel to the same things

247
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,940
 that are sources of stress in our life,

248
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,860
 that if we're gonna experience more freedom from it,

249
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,940
 I believe God tonight wants to deepen

250
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,640
 the amount of peace in your heart.

251
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,900
 But to do so, we've gotta address some of the sources

252
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,140
 that are filling our heart with stress.

253
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,100
 Well, the first source of stress is she had stress

254
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,500
 from all she had to get done.

255
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,540
 Let me read the text again, 'cause this is our life.

256
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,220
 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations

257
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,180
 that had to be made.

258
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,900
 Who said they had to be made?

259
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,260
 Jesus, we're not told Jesus commanded,

260
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,440
 "Hey, Martha, I want you to go in there

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,960
 "and make that favorite dish, a little soup.

262
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,940
 "If you wouldn't mind, bring me a tub of Chico as well."

263
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,620
 We're not told he said any of that stuff.

264
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,740
 We're told that Martha just said, "Jesus is coming over."

265
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,020
 She feels the all that has to be done,

266
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,400
 pressure on her life, that I have to do this.

267
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,460
 I have to get something ready and the guys are coming in

268
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,540
 and I gotta make something special.

269
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
 I mean, it's Jesus, can't just give him fish and loaves.

270
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,560
 That's just an everyday meal.

271
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,100
 Gotta whip up something good.

272
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,820
 And she begins to build into this pressure

273
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,300
 of all that had to be done.

274
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,460
 We're not told that anything had to be done.

275
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,020
 But this is the same stress source

276
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,800
 that impacts so much of our life.

277
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,180
 Where I can find myself going, "Man, I have to do this.

278
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,020
 "I have to do this."

279
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,060
 Or you can find yourself believing,

280
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,720
 "Man, I have to go to that happy hour

281
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,620
 "if I'm gonna get in a good relationship with my boss.

282
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,380
 "Oh man, I have to be on social media

283
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,900
 "in order to have some interactions,

284
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,360
 "keep up with people from high school.

285
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,660
 "I have to start a side hustle,

286
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,220
 "probably Etsy, in order to keep up.

287
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,620
 "I have to be on dating apps in order to find a relationship

288
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,540
 "where I'm gonna be the cat lady for forever.

289
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,260
 "I have to be, I have to be, I have to be.

290
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,460
 "I gotta go to church, have to get in a small group,

291
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,220
 "have to pay more bills, have to get a new car."

292
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,700
 When you don't have to do any of that.

293
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,980
 Or we just fall victim to this, "Oh, I have to, I have to."

294
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
 Who said you had to?

295
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,560
 If anything, you get to.

296
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
 But you're gonna experience stress when you live in this,

297
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,220
 "Oh no, I have to, I have to, I have to.

298
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,000
 "I have to make sure that it's my friend's birthday.

299
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,560
 "I have to make sure that I send a message

300
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,660
 "of it's happy birthday, I have to, I have to."

301
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,780
 And Martha fell into that little whisper,

302
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,780
 "You have to, you have to, you have to."

303
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,860
 Which anytime is present and acted on

304
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,700
 just increases stress inside of our life.

305
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,640
 A friend of mine this week said,

306
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,860
 "Instagram is like a living to-do list for me."

307
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,420
 I thought this was brilliant.

308
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,940
 And by that, she meant, "I go on there

309
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,960
 "and I am confronted with the things that I need to do

310
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,940
 "that I wasn't even thinking that I needed to do."

311
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
 Here's what I mean.

312
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,900
 I get on there and somebody posts their picture

313
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,240
 of their engagement and I'm like,

314
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,100
 "Oh man, add to the subconscious to-do list,

315
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,440
 "find a boyfriend or just a guy.

316
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,720
 "Add to the to-do list when I see someone's car,

317
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,280
 "man, my car is total garbage.

318
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,140
 "Or when I see someone's vacation,

319
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,900
 "add to the to-do list, make more money

320
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,640
 "so that I can go on vacations,

321
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,620
 "that it just feeds this, feeds this, have to."

322
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,900
 And like Martha, anytime that's present,

323
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,240
 it's gonna just fuel stress.

324
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,140
 There are a few things you have to,

325
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,260
 there's a lot of things you get to

326
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,220
 and hit the pressure relief.

327
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,980
 You don't have to do anything.

328
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,260
 Another source is the idea that it all depends on me.

329
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,300
 Martha was operating underneath this mentality of,

330
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,400
 man, it all depends on me, it all depends on me.

331
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,140
 I mean, she could have gone into Jesus.

332
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,260
 What's crazy is like three chapters earlier before this,

333
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,880
 Jesus takes a kid's Lunchable

334
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,580
 and he turns two fish and a few loaves

335
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,820
 into enough to feed 5,000 people.

336
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,300
 I mean, previously, he'd already turned water into wine.

337
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,540
 Imagine if Martha was like,

338
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,960
 "Look, hey, Jesus, you didn't really give me a lot of time.

339
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,680
 "There's no clocks here, so we wouldn't have known anyways.

340
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,740
 "But point being, how about we do that water into wine thing

341
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,860
 "or the fish and loaves thing

342
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,140
 "and you multiply it to feed the boys?

343
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,120
 "'Cause mama ain't got time right now."

344
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,780
 And she could have had everything that she needed.

345
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,340
 But she bought into this mentality of,

346
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,700
 man, I need to do it on my own, it all depends on me.

347
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,420
 Another source of stress we see from Martha

348
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,980
 is she was distracted.

349
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,420
 She was distracted.

350
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,840
 That's what the text says in verse 40.

351
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,820
 Just like that phone is distracted right now.

352
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,480
 (congregation laughing)

353
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,340
 She was distracted.

354
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,180
 What do I mean?

355
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,840
 The word that's translated for distracted

356
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,740
 is to be pulled in many directions.

357
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,740
 It was actually an ancient form of torture, French torture,

358
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,700
 an execution that was called death by distraction.

359
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,780
 And it was a medieval practice where they would tie ropes

360
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,780
 around each four limbs.

361
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,700
 So rope on your leg, each leg, rope on each arm,

362
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,460
 and then they would tie those ropes to horses

363
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,460
 and have the horses run in four different directions

364
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,220
 in order to have death by distraction, being pulled apart.

365
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,600
 And that same idea is still relevant today

366
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,520
 where distraction and being pulled

367
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,260
 in every different direction

368
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,700
 can bring death into our lives.

369
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,060
 Death with relationships.

370
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,140
 Death in your ability to be present with other people.

371
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,080
 Death in your intimacy with God.

372
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,540
 That there still can be distraction,

373
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,820
 and Martha was distracted with all that she needed

374
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,800
 to get done.

375
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,260
 It wasn't even sinful things.

376
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,700
 Like this is what's really important.

377
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,620
 You can experience a level of distraction

378
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,620
 that impacts your relationship with God in a negative way,

379
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,900
 and it's not even bad things.

380
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,980
 You're not choosing between, hey, today should I go

381
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,060
 commit armed robbery or go to church?

382
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,020
 It's just being bombarded with a bunch of distractions

383
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,740
 which right now you can't even focus on what I'm saying

384
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,540
 because you're bombarded with all the things,

385
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,980
 emails you may not have sent,

386
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,580
 or what somebody may have liked or commented on a post

387
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,160
 that you had, and it's just fueling distraction.

388
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,060
 It's probably never been easier thanks to the iPhone.

389
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,740
 2011 or 2007, Steve Jobs created a device

390
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,620
 that transformed or has transformed our world

391
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,340
 as much as the printing press did in 1490,

392
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,040
 where now we live with portable computers

393
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,380
 that bombard us with information,

394
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,780
 and part of it is amazing.

395
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,500
 Like you can be sitting right now where you're at

396
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,940
 and order something from Amazon,

397
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,980
 and it will beat your house by the time you get there.

398
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,820
 You wanna know the best sushi place in town?

399
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,740
 Wonder No More.

400
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,300
 There's an app called Yelp.

401
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,620
 Fastest way to get home?

402
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,460
 Waze app.

403
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,420
 Got you all day long.

404
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,340
 Whatever you wanna know, what are the symptoms of measles

405
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,600
 or the black plague?

406
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,100
 Check out WebMD, it's got it.

407
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,120
 And yet at the benefit of all that information,

408
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,340
 it's also study after study showing

409
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,140
 it is impacting our physiological stress levels.

410
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,260
 Heart rates, ability to sleep

411
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,500
 are all being negatively impacted.

412
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,520
 The average young adult, one study showed,

413
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 touches their phone between 2,700 and 4,000 times a day.

414
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,400
 You're asleep for eight of those hours, hopefully.

415
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,020
 Do the math.

416
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,420
 It's just touching, swiping, clicking.

417
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
 And this incredible gift has also come

418
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,260
 at an incredible ability, or with an incredible ability,

419
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,500
 to distract our ability to be present.

420
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,340
 So I wanna do something

421
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,500
 that you probably have not done in a long time.

422
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,100
 I want you to take your phone right now, take it out.

423
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,940
 Everybody take their phone out, okay?

424
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,060
 Lift it up.

425
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,240
 All of you rule followers doing it,

426
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,780
 the ones who are not rule followers,

427
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,860
 the ones that are not doing it,

428
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,220
 take your phone out right now, got it?

429
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,200
 Okay, I want you to bring 'em up to the stage.

430
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,460
 We're gonna give 'em, no, I'm just kidding.

431
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,960
 I want you to take your phone.

432
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,260
 I want you to turn it off.

433
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,220
 I want you to say,

434
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,400
 "Man, this thing's not my master for 20 minutes."

435
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,780
 And half of you are gonna do it,

436
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,100
 the other half are gonna show and prove my point

437
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,060
 that it is your master.

438
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,260
 So I want you to take it right now.

439
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,240
 And you haven't done this, you may not have ever done this.

440
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,620
 So if you have an iPhone, I can walk you through it.

441
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,220
 You push this button and this button, and you slide it off.

442
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,380
 If you have an Android, you are dismissed.

443
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,020
 And I'm totally kidding, it's a joke.

444
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,700
 It's a joke.

445
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,500
 I love the Android people.

446
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,940
 Don't email, it's a total joke.

447
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
 Can't email on an Android though, I feel like I'm safe.

448
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,140
 But the point being, turn off your phone.

449
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,020
 What am I doing, I'm roasting Android people?

450
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,660
 (audience laughing)

451
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,100
 And for the next 20 minutes, 20 minutes,

452
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,500
 look at me right now, 'cause half you guys,

453
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,020
 or a third of you, you still haven't done it,

454
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,980
 and you're like, "No, I'm not gonna do it,

455
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,260
 "I wanna keep checking TikTok."

456
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,060
 Turn it off for 20 minutes.

457
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,340
 And you'll experience more peace,

458
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,460
 and I'll tell you why at the end.

459
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,780
 Which is for the next handful of minutes,

460
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,620
 and I know what you're thinking,

461
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,900
 what if there's an emergency?

462
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,860
 Our tech team is gonna keep their phones on,

463
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,180
 so if we get bombed by China, they're gonna let us know.

464
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,140
 Or whoever, I'm gonna get another email for that,

465
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,980
 good grief.

466
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,700
 (audience laughing)

467
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,580
 And everything's gonna be okay.

468
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,300
 Everything's gonna be okay.

469
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,720
 But that ability to be somewhere,

470
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,140
 and be constantly bombarded,

471
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,740
 where you're even trying to read the Bible app,

472
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,060
 and you're getting texts and notifications,

473
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,500
 and it is pulling your attention in different directions.

474
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,880
 And just like Martha, it is creating stress and anxiety,

475
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,560
 and a low-grade anxiety.

476
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,220
 One study said that the constant influx of information

477
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,180
 is what is triggering and keeps us in a constant state

478
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,580
 of experiencing a low-grade anxiety at all times.

479
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,380
 That we were not made to be constantly bombarded

480
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,940
 with potential for information.

481
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,620
 The third source that we see from her is fear.

482
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,820
 Number three source of stress is fear.

483
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,300
 And if you take notes on your phone, don't take notes,

484
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,500
 just keep it there, don't turn it back on.

485
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,540
 You little phone addict, you, you keep it where it is.

486
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,460
 But the third thing that she has is fear.

487
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,660
 That Jesus says, hey, you're worried and you're anxious

488
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,180
 about many things, you're upset,

489
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,580
 you're troubled about many things.

490
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,100
 Just like her, stress was driven by fear,

491
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,660
 a lot of our stress is driven by fear.

492
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,100
 What do I mean?

493
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,360
 Like we can overwork ourself and feel like,

494
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,980
 I need to be successful.

495
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,340
 I need to be seen as somebody that people look at

496
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,320
 and go, wow, he's amazing.

497
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,140
 And so I let that drive or that desire to be seen some way

498
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,260
 by other people drive me to the place where I work so much.

499
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,940
 I'm constantly looking for deals.

500
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,100
 I'm constantly starting another side hustle.

501
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,100
 I'm constantly devoted to building my accomplishment list,

502
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,180
 which is driven by a fear of not being seen a certain way.

503
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,680
 A fear of being left behind is another one.

504
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,700
 Or a fear of not keeping up with everyone else in our life,

505
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,260
 of relationships, of getting married,

506
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,140
 of having children, of buying a home.

507
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,620
 That fear can creep in and create an angst of,

508
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,440
 oh my goodness, I need to do more.

509
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,100
 And it's fear, just like with Martha,

510
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,460
 that was driving her to please or get approval.

511
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,820
 That fear of not being enough is often what contributes

512
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,500
 to our stress.

513
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,700
 And we're gonna walk through the solution.

514
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,220
 I'm just setting up the conversation of all these things

515
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,700
 that can drive so much of the stress that we carry around.

516
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,720
 I remember talking to a friend of mine who was in ministry

517
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,060
 and just like with any job, if you're passionate about it

518
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,300
 and you like it, it can be challenging to run

519
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,380
 at a sustainable pace.

520
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,740
 And I remember talking to him, he's older,

521
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,260
 he's farther down the road.

522
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,260
 And I just said, man, how do you maintain healthy boundaries

523
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,880
 and also take on responsibilities and do it all?

524
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,240
 And he said something that I'll never forget.

525
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,380
 Asked him that question, we're talking on the phone.

526
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,200
 It was like silence for just a second.

527
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,580
 Said, I'm gonna tell you the answer.

528
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,280
 I need you to listen very closely.

529
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,520
 You become okay with letting everyone down.

530
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 There's gonna be people that are gonna think,

531
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,440
 well, he should have called me on my birthday

532
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
 or should have come to that party

533
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,440
 or he should have worked later

534
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,560
 or I wonder what he's doing this weekend

535
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,060
 and why he didn't come here.

536
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,640
 There's gonna be people for the rest of your life

537
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,900
 that are not gonna understand you,

538
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,360
 that are not gonna know everything that you're going through.

539
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,780
 They're gonna put expectations

540
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,940
 that they never even verbalize on you.

541
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,840
 And you gotta come to the place where you say,

542
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,280
 I don't live for everyone else's approval

543
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,720
 because if I do, I'm fighting a battle I'll never win.

544
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,000
 I live for God's approval.

545
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,080
 And so at the end of the day,

546
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,040
 I'm gonna stand before him and say,

547
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
 I've tried to be faithful and handle

548
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,540
 and do everything I can.

549
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,120
 But if I live for a life

550
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,260
 that doesn't ever disappoint someone,

551
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,160
 it's never gonna happen.

552
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,480
 And so you've gotta die to the idol of approval of people,

553
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,120
 the fear of letting someone down.

554
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
 It'll just drive you to stress.

555
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
 Finally, all of that drives us to a life

556
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,000
 where the reason for a busyness.

557
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,040
 Corrie Ten Boom was a Holocaust survivor Christian.

558
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,640
 She said, "If the devil cannot make us bad,

559
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,420
 "he will make us busy."

560
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,840
 The reason number four that we bring on stress

561
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,980
 is we just are doing too much.

562
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,300
 That phone went off.

563
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,840
 You are ousted, bro.

564
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,640
 You are ousted.

565
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
 You are just, no, I'm kidding.

566
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,040
 All right.

567
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,500
 That it'll make us busy.

568
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,640
 There's a acronym or a cross stick

569
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,800
 that was busy is standing for being under Satan's yoke.

570
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,360
 That if he can make you busy,

571
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,520
 he'll take your eyes off of where life is found.

572
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
 He'll get you going through constantly,

573
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,720
 just going through the motions and the treadmill of life,

574
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,160
 never actually going anywhere that matters.

575
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,020
 But you'll be busy.

576
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,920
 So those are some of the sources that bring stress in.

577
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,080
 And then there's some of the side effects

578
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,840
 that we see paralleled in Martha's story

579
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,080
 that are in our own where in verse 40, it says this.

580
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,880
 She came to Jesus and she asked him,

581
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,000
 remember, Jesus is sitting there in the living room.

582
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,600
 Everybody's sitting around,

583
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,200
 listening to the teaching of Jesus.

584
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
 And Martha's in the kitchen,

585
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,880
 whipping up scrambling eggs or doing whatever she's doing.

586
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,680
 And she interrupts Jesus and she says,

587
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,680
 "Lord, don't you care that my sister

588
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,720
 "has left me to do all the work by myself?"

589
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,560
 I love it.

590
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,680
 The manipulation and the like, just passive aggressiveness

591
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,440
 bleeds off the pages.

592
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,160
 Is this because you're not a caring God, Jesus?

593
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,000
 Is that why this is?

594
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,120
 "Lord, don't you care?

595
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,680
 "Tell her to come help me."

596
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,380
 "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered.

597
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,040
 "You are worried and upset about many things,

598
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,880
 "the side effects of stress."

599
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,960
 Martha is telling Jesus what to do.

600
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,240
 It's not a good look.

601
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,800
 And you contrast that to Mary,

602
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,080
 who is sitting at the feet of Jesus,

603
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,740
 listening what to do.

604
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,980
 And Martha, because of all the stress that's taking place,

605
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,880
 she does what often happens when you're stressed,

606
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,160
 you reach for control.

607
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,840
 You reach to try to control situations,

608
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,960
 relationships, circumstances, what people think.

609
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,000
 And she reaches, and the direction she reaches

610
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,080
 is an attempt to control her sister

611
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,720
 and control God himself.

612
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,280
 She's blaming, another side effect,

613
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,120
 it's not just control,

614
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,640
 she's blaming other people for her problems.

615
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,900
 "Hey, my sister is why I'm so stressed.

616
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,440
 "Why don't you tell her to come in here and come help me?"

617
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
 She's, in essence, even blaming Jesus.

618
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,120
 "Don't you care?"

619
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,240
 And Martha is telling him what to do.

620
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,360
 This same thing happens today.

621
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,080
 When we're distracted, we get self-centered,

622
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,680
 stressed because God is not doing the things

623
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,600
 that we expect God to do.

624
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,760
 And we bargain with him, "God, I told you

625
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,820
 "that if I went to church,

626
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,840
 "then you were gonna bring someone

627
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,080
 "and a healthy relationship along.

628
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,100
 "God, if I'm honest in these finances,

629
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,680
 "then you were supposed to let this start up work."

630
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,240
 And we allow stress to lead us to attempt to control.

631
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,660
 She asked the question, "Lord, don't you care?

632
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,540
 "'Cause if you did,

633
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,620
 "then you would tell Martha to get in here."

634
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,120
 Baked into that assumption is a pretty profound truth,

635
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,860
 a pretty profound presupposition she's starting with.

636
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,020
 "If you cared, you would behave

637
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,440
 "how I expect you to behave.

638
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,400
 "And so because, God, you are not behaving,

639
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,700
 "or the situation is now not how I expect it to be,

640
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,960
 "you must not care about me."

641
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,560
 She's doing something that human experience includes.

642
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,320
 "God, because I'm looking at my situation

643
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,520
 "and how things are going and what's going on in life,

644
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,380
 "and I don't like the way it looks,

645
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,240
 "I can conclude you must not care about me.

646
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,960
 "Now, if I'm Jesus and I'm sitting there

647
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,800
 "and I'm trying to teach,

648
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,500
 "and who knows what he's walking them through,

649
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,240
 "some of the parables or whatever he's teaching

650
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,080
 "in the living room, and he's getting interrupted

651
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,180
 "by a woman in an apron who's saying,

652
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,680
 "'Why don't you care about me?'

653
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,460
 "You gotta be thinking he's going, 'Martha,

654
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,720
 "'of course I care.

655
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,900
 "In 11 days, I'm gonna be crucified on a cross for you.

656
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,300
 "Of course I care.

657
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,920
 "And just because you can't connect the dots

658
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,900
 "on how I could care in this situation

659
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,080
 "doesn't mean that I don't care.

660
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,080
 "I'll prove on the cross how much I care for Martha

661
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,640
 "and how much he cares for you,

662
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,960
 "how much he cares for me,

663
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,440
 "that I will even die on the cross for you."

664
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,940
 Now, this brings up a really challenging thing in life

665
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,300
 that you've gotta have some awareness of

666
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,700
 if you read the Bible and you hear pastors like myself say,

667
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,980
 "Hey, God cares about you.

668
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,040
 "We just sang a song.

669
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,920
 "If he clothes the lilies and if he watches the sparrow,

670
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,300
 "how much more will he care for you?"

671
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,360
 And that's the truth.

672
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,500
 But your definition of care is really important in that.

673
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,640
 Because it may not always be that God acts

674
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,380
 in a way that you think God should act

675
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,220
 because he cares about you.

676
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,040
 What do I mean?

677
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,060
 I have a three-year-old daughter.

678
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,660
 She, her name's Monroe.

679
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,580
 She's a firecracker.

680
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,420
 Pray for us.

681
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,100
 And she will, if we let her,

682
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,500
 she would eat Pringles for every meal.

683
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,180
 I mean breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack.

684
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,500
 And if it wasn't that, then it would be Cheetos

685
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 or some other incredibly unhealthy food.

686
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,580
 Now, because we love her and care for her,

687
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,140
 there are times where as good parents,

688
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,040
 we don't allow her to just eat Cheetos

689
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,160
 or don't just allow her to eat junk food.

690
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,340
 Why?

691
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,320
 Because we don't care?

692
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,160
 No, because we care for her.

693
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,560
 And she thinks, "You guys hate me.

694
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,040
 "You don't listen to me.

695
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,400
 "First, you wouldn't let me wear the dress I wanted to wear

696
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,760
 "and now the Pringles."

697
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,760
 And she will think, "My parents don't care."

698
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,720
 But because she's three, she can't connect the dots.

699
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,360
 She can't fully understand it.

700
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,900
 I think the same experience happens with us in God.

701
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,380
 Where though we're older than three,

702
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,740
 just at 24, you think that you will fully,

703
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,340
 it will always comprehend the wisdom of an infinite God

704
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,560
 who is a far greater distance between my age

705
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,020
 and my daughter's age than my age in God and who he is.

706
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,960
 And there are times where God absolutely would say,

707
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,120
 "Yes, I care.

708
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,840
 "Do not draw the conclusion that I don't

709
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,180
 "just based on things not being how you want."

710
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,700
 And Martha's confronted with this.

711
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,760
 There's another occasion where Martha experienced

712
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,440
 this reality and it was one that is probably

713
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,040
 one of the more powerful stories in the Bible

714
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,560
 and certainly the most powerful moments in Martha's life.

715
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,440
 Like I said, Martha had a sister named Mary

716
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,480
 and Martha also had a brother named Lazarus.

717
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,520
 And this group was really close with Jesus.

718
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,080
 I mean, multiple times throughout the gospels,

719
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,200
 they talk about Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.

720
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,940
 They were just like boys with Jesus and the disciples

721
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,080
 and they're all friends together.

722
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,080
 And one day Jesus is told that Lazarus has gotten sick,

723
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,200
 like really sick.

724
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
 And it's in John chapter 11, it tells us this.

725
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
 "A man named Lazarus was sick.

726
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,640
 "He was from Bethany, the village of Mary

727
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,900
 "and her sister Martha.

728
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,060
 "So the sisters sent word to Jesus,

729
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,460
 "Lord, the one you love is sick."

730
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,400
 So Lazarus is sick, they send word to Jesus.

731
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,640
 They say, "Hey, our brother is sick,

732
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,440
 "expecting he's gonna come home

733
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,760
 "and he's gonna heal our brother."

734
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,680
 This is what Jesus was doing at the time.

735
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,600
 And we're told in the text,

736
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,640
 I don't have time to read the whole thing,

737
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,120
 but Jesus says he's sick

738
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,040
 and he waits an additional two days.

739
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,200
 And during that time, Lazarus dies.

740
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,120
 And Jesus then tells his disciples,

741
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,160
 it's as though he was waiting for the sickness to happen

742
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,720
 or he wasn't in a rush to go change

743
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,640
 or stop the brother from dying.

744
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,680
 And he tells his disciples,

745
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,520
 "We're gonna go see Lazarus."

746
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,200
 And Jesus walks back towards the village

747
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,720
 where Mary and Martha and Lazarus has now been buried.

748
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,080
 His funeral has happened.

749
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,180
 And Martha's told by somebody,

750
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,440
 "Hey, Jesus is about to be here.

751
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,040
 "He's coming to the village to come see you."

752
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,120
 And she runs outside, she falls at the feet of Jesus.

753
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,420
 She says this, "Lord," Martha said,

754
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:25,060
 "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

755
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,020
 "But I know that even now,

756
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,220
 "God will give you whatever you ask."

757
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,720
 Jesus takes her to the tomb.

758
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,400
 He's basically in that exchange, says,

759
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,840
 "Your brother will rise again."

760
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,560
 She says, "Man, I know someday he will rise."

761
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,640
 And he says, "He will rise today.

762
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
 "I am the resurrection.

763
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,380
 "I am the life."

764
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,600
 Later in the story, we're told that Jesus waited

765
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,940
 in order for all of the funeral and everything to happen

766
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,040
 for him to pass away so that the power of God

767
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,060
 would be displayed.

768
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,440
 Her assumption was that if you were here,

769
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,280
 he wouldn't have died.

770
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,980
 And Jesus basically responds with,

771
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,240
 "I waited so that you and all those who look

772
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,520
 "would see the power of God."

773
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,800
 But here's what happens that displays not just

774
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,420
 his control, his sovereignty is the word,

775
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,520
 but his care.

776
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,620
 He walks up to the tomb of Lazarus,

777
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,680
 and he's about to say, "Roll the stone away

778
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,500
 "and bring this man back to life."

779
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,740
 And before he does, there's this crowd around the tomb.

780
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,580
 And we're told Jesus just starts to weep.

781
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,860
 And he's weeping.

782
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,300
 I mean, not like a crocodile tear.

783
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,360
 The word in Greek is that he's bawling.

784
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,100
 Why?

785
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,220
 He's about to raise the man from the dead.

786
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,500
 Why are you crying?

787
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,200
 I mean, think about that.

788
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,540
 And he puts on full display the compassion of our God

789
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,100
 who looks death in the eyes and says,

790
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,940
 "It was never supposed to be like this."

791
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,740
 Does he care?

792
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,840
 Of course I care.

793
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,380
 I displayed it on a cross,

794
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,240
 and I care more deeply about you than you care about you.

795
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,060
 And he says, "Lazarus, come out of the tomb,

796
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,120
 "and this man comes back to life."

797
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,480
 And Martha again sees the care of her God,

798
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,180
 despite the fact that it contradicted

799
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,820
 what she thinks if he cared, he would have done.

800
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,340
 But stress can make us assume and control

801
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,120
 and self-centered and project.

802
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,620
 It's the side effects of stress.

803
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,020
 And finally, we see the positive example from Mary,

804
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,240
 but we also see something that I think is one of the single

805
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,260
 most profound sentences Jesus would ever speak.

806
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,260
 Gosh, this is like my favorite part of this week.

807
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,700
 Here's what he says.

808
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,940
 Let me read the verse before and the verse after.

809
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,020
 Remember the context.

810
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,420
 It's like 12 dudes and these two women

811
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,240
 bickering about the meal.

812
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,980
 She came and she said, "Lord, don't you care my sister's

813
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,860
 "left me to do all the work?

814
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,960
 "Tell her to help me."

815
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,660
 "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered,

816
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,480
 "you are worried and upset about many things,

817
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,300
 "but few things are needed."

818
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,160
 Scratch that, "Indeed, only one."

819
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,880
 "Mary has chosen what is better,

820
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,380
 "and it will not be taken away from her."

821
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,780
 What did Jesus just say?

822
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,860
 Jesus, in front of these two women and 12 guys,

823
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,860
 bottom lines the entire point of existence on planet Earth.

824
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,040
 There is only one thing that matters

825
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,800
 at the end of the day, Martha,

826
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,920
 and it's what Mary is doing right now.

827
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,520
 That the entire point of your existence on planet Earth.

828
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,440
 That's why I say it's one of the more profound sentences.

829
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,960
 He said, "You know what really matters in life?

830
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
 "Actually, only one thing really matters,

831
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,920
 "and it's what Mary's doing right now."

832
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,020
 What is Mary doing?

833
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,720
 Nothing.

834
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,620
 She's sitting at the feet of Jesus.

835
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,040
 She's sitting in relationship with him.

836
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,600
 And he says, "You know what the point of life is?

837
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,840
 "You're concerned and consumed, and you're stressed,

838
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,640
 "and you're worried, and you're focused on all these things,

839
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,820
 "and you know that none of those things matter.

840
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,040
 "Let me tell you the one thing that matters in life,

841
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,660
 "the one reason you're on the planet, Martha,

842
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,660
 "the reason why every person who's ever been created

843
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,800
 "and born and lives, the only reason

844
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,680
 "that you're here is to know me."

845
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,240
 It's a really profound thing.

846
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,840
 If I'm Jesus, I would have saved that line

847
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,880
 for a huge crowd of people outside,

848
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,480
 but this bro just chooses in the living room

849
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,760
 from Martha, "Hey, the one reason you're on planet Earth

850
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,920
 "is what Mary's doing, listening to me."

851
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,360
 And the one reason he would say to you,

852
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,320
 with all the stress, and the fear, and the concern,

853
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,000
 and the weight, "Listen to me very closely.

854
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,160
 "There is one reason you're here,

855
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,200
 "and all these different messages are gonna bombard you

856
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,820
 "every single day about what you need to get done,

857
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,920
 "what you haven't got done, what more you need to do.

858
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,440
 "There is one thing that will actually bring you life,

859
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,940
 "and the one thing behind why you have life,

860
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,980
 "and that's to know Jesus, and to walk with Jesus."

861
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,640
 And he brilliantly says, "There's only one thing

862
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,440
 "that at the end of the day matters.

863
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,620
 "It's not cooking, Martha.

864
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,780
 "It's not business.

865
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,860
 "It's not marriage.

866
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,660
 "It's me.

867
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,520
 "And you and every other person knowing me."

868
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,920
 The solution to stress is sitting with the Savior,

869
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,840
 because by sitting, that just means

870
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,960
 sitting under the teaching of someone.

871
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,100
 That's what that idea meant,

872
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,480
 that she's sitting there listening to the teaching.

873
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,440
 She's sitting there learning from Jesus,

874
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,920
 and in doing so, she's experiencing her purpose,

875
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,440
 the reason God has her on this planet,

876
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,360
 which is also the solution to the stress

877
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,660
 that bombards us from all the different things

878
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,720
 that fight for our attention.

879
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,560
 And Jesus would say, "There's only one thing

880
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,000
 "at the end of your life that makes it

881
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 "or breaks it as a success, and it's knowing me.

882
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,060
 "Only one thing that ultimately matters."

883
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,480
 So the solution to our stress, what does this look like?

884
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,460
 Practically, for us, it's not gonna look like

885
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,520
 sitting in Martha's living room.

886
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,440
 It's gonna look like spending time reading your Bible,

887
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,420
 and listening.

888
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,120
 Tomorrow when you wake up, I want you to open your Bible

889
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,880
 and spend five minutes, maybe it's been five months,

890
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,200
 five years, maybe it's been never since you read it.

891
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,560
 If you don't have a Bible, we have Bibles

892
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,720
 in the Welcome Center, it's a free gift for you.

893
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,080
 If you're listening online, check out Amazon.

894
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,080
 But if you don't have one, open it up.

895
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,040
 Start in the book of John, or any of the Gospels,

896
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,440
 and just read a chapter, and say, "God, will you speak to me

897
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,160
 "and help me to see what happened?"

898
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,100
 Take notes, spend time in praying, and just say,

899
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,720
 "God, hold on."

900
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,080
 Maybe you read a text and you're reminded,

901
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,360
 "God is in control.

902
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,160
 "So God, will you help me today just to meditate?

903
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,280
 "You're in control.

904
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,840
 "You're in control over my job, my boss, my family,

905
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,360
 "my future, I'm just gonna hold on to that.

906
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:38,160
 "Maybe it's that you are for me,

907
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,040
 "that you talk in this chapter

908
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,480
 "about how much you love humanity, and you gave your life.

909
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,520
 "I'm gonna remember that, 'cause I'm gonna be tempted

910
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,960
 "to think, oh no, God doesn't love me,

911
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,120
 "he doesn't care, he just helped me."

912
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
 And you just meditate on that for a day.

913
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,760
 But you were created to walk in relationship with God,

914
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,080
 created to experience your purpose.

915
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,760
 And that one thing is gonna involve you spending time

916
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,360
 praying, reading, listening, journaling out,

917
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,040
 and telling God what you're feeling.

918
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,080
 And you know what happens when that takes place?

919
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,280
 It's like the more you spend time with Jesus,

920
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,280
 you begin to get clarity on the things that he says matter,

921
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,040
 and even how to do those things that he says matter.

922
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,720
 And that clarity begins to give you some sort of sense of,

923
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,300
 hey, these are the things I should spend my time on.

924
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,240
 Not the only things I should spend my time on,

925
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,600
 but these are the focuses I need to at least make sure

926
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
 are a priority, because the more that I listen

927
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,080
 and walk with Jesus, the more I experience peace,

928
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,480
 and the more I experience life,

929
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,560
 called abundant life, he calls it.

930
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,920
 And so I begin to be familiarized and know,

931
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,360
 this is how I'm gonna use my time.

932
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,320
 Like pretend this represents your time.

933
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,600
 You got 24 hours in a day, you can't change that.

934
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,320
 I can't change that, everybody's got the same amount of time.

935
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,640
 You, me, Beyonce, Thomas Edison, everybody.

936
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,760
 But you can choose what you fill that time with.

937
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,900
 And this would represent just all the extra stuff.

938
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,640
 It's not bad stuff, it's your call of duty,

939
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,600
 which probably is not a great use of time,

940
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,040
 but it's the shopping at the mall,

941
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,480
 it's hanging out with friends, it's a happy hour at work,

942
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,640
 it's whatever it is, it's just resting

943
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,120
 and watching a football game.

944
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,840
 And if you're not careful and intentional

945
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,600
 to put in the big rocks, the most important things in life,

946
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,200
 then your life becomes filled up

947
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
 and things that God commands to be a part,

948
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
 things that bring about the most peace,

949
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,480
 there's not room for.

950
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,760
 But if you say, hey, I'm gonna be intentional,

951
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,000
 'cause God says, you know,

952
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
 I'm not supposed to walk through life alone,

953
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,160
 I need other people, other Christians in my life,

954
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,280
 'cause life is hard, but it's a lot harder if I'm alone.

955
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,640
 So you know what, big rock,

956
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,320
 I'm gonna make sure every week I meet with my guys group

957
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,440
 or my girls group, I'm gonna have people in my life,

958
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
 that's in there, man.

959
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,400
 And so Thursday nights, if we meet on Thursdays,

960
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,500
 does that mean I miss Thursday night football if it happens?

961
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,080
 Yeah, or we watch the game together.

962
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,920
 But that's a rock that I'm putting in there.

963
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,800
 What's another one?

964
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,520
 Spending time daily with God.

965
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,240
 I'm gonna spend time daily in God's word.

966
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,080
 What does that mean?

967
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,560
 It means that if I'm gonna work out with a bro

968
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,860
 or with somebody in the morning,

969
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,240
 I'm gonna wake up even earlier to spend time in God's word.

970
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
 Or after the workout,

971
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,480
 I'm gonna sit outside of my office building

972
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,880
 and I'm gonna open my Bible

973
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,120
 before I ever go inside of office, ever go to work,

974
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,400
 I'm gonna spend time, I'm gonna read.

975
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,280
 That rock's going in, I'm putting it in.

976
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,440
 I can't control everything,

977
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,780
 it's not the only things going in,

978
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,060
 but I'm gonna put that into my life.

979
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,000
 I'm gonna prioritize being serving

980
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,320
 and connected to a local church,

981
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,200
 'cause God made you uniquely,

982
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,320
 you have gifts, you have a mind.

983
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,400
 There is no one on the planet that is like you,

984
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,140
 and he wants you to use those gifts

985
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,280
 to be a gift to other people.

986
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
 And you use the way he wired you,

987
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,200
 and so you decide, you know what?

988
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,480
 That's gonna be what I do.

989
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,600
 I'm gonna come serve at the porch,

990
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,760
 I'm gonna come serve in my city,

991
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,520
 I'm gonna go serve at the food banks downtown,

992
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,640
 and I'm gonna push back darkness.

993
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,040
 Do you know how many kids need mentors

994
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,180
 in the education system inside of this city?

995
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,600
 The opportunities and the gifts and the resources you have.

996
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,960
 And Jesus says, "To whom much is expected,"

997
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
 or to whom much is given, much is expected.

998
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
 And you're gonna stand before God

999
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,320
 and you're gonna give him an account.

1000
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
 He's already used my 20s, he's already used my life,

1001
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,800
 how are you using them?

1002
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,640
 But some of you guys are saying,

1003
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,320
 "No, that's a big rock, man, I'm putting that in.

1004
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,880
 "I'm gonna serve like Christ served me,

1005
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,840
 "I'm gonna serve and be a source of light

1006
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,900
 "in a really, really dark world.

1007
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,160
 "Not only that, I'm gonna be plugged into a local church.

1008
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,100
 "I'm gonna be connected, I'm gonna walk authentic,

1009
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,800
 "I'm gonna live in relationship with my family,

1010
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,900
 "they're not even believers,

1011
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,940
 "but I'm gonna prioritize praying for them,

1012
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,160
 "pursuing them, spending time with them,

1013
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,360
 "telling them about my life,

1014
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,680
 "and I'm gonna put those rocks in."

1015
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,200
 And then all of a sudden, anything that I got left extra,

1016
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
 it's not that I'm not still doing Call of Duty,

1017
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,040
 if that's your thing, or going shopping

1018
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,960
 at wherever you shop,

1019
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,040
 but it's not taking over what's most important.

1020
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,900
 And God's not against any of those neutral things,

1021
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,240
 He is pro for you experiencing the abundant life,

1022
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,740
 and the more you spend time with Jesus,

1023
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,920
 I sit at His feet, that's what it means,

1024
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,720
 to be taught and learn, this is the things that matter.

1025
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,800
 And I can put into practice the things that matter.

1026
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,200
 And that allows me the margin to still have fun,

1027
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,160
 still relax, and still travel with friends,

1028
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,540
 do all of that, but not at the expense

1029
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,320
 of filling up my life,

1030
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,580
 and not putting in the big rocks first.

1031
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:06,680
 And Jesus says there's one thing in life that matters,

1032
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,460
 and you're either gonna spend your life missing it,

1033
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,580
 or spend your life experiencing it,

1034
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,200
 and that's knowing me, and walking in relationship with me.

1035
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,160
 Francis Chan said, who's an author, friend,

1036
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,240
 I've been here before,

1037
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,780
 our greatest fear should not be of failure,

1038
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,940
 but of succeeding at things that really don't matter in life.

1039
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,260
 Am I saying that if you work 90 hours a week,

1040
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,480
 and you can't be a part of a church,

1041
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,420
 you should change jobs, yes.

1042
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,080
 Am I saying you may need to get off dating apps,

1043
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,180
 because they're constantly making or breaking your day, yes.

1044
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,020
 Maybe.

1045
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:52,100
 Am I saying that you should not go to that happy hour,

1046
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,160
 birthday party this week,

1047
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,740
 because you have such a packed week, maybe.

1048
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,440
 Am I saying you may never be caught up

1049
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,420
 with the latest Netflix trend that's going on,

1050
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,420
 that everybody's already watched,

1051
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,100
 and you're like, oh, another thing to do.

1052
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,680
 Yes, you may never.

1053
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,180
 But all those things are just additions,

1054
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,520
 and they're never meant to place a role,

1055
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,080
 of the big rocks, and the thing,

1056
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,660
 the one thing Jesus said you were made for.

1057
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,420
 As crazy as Martha,

1058
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,940
 the FOMO you gotta think she had after,

1059
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,600
 I can only imagine, 'cause here's what happened.

1060
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
 Martha has the Son of God in her living room.

1061
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,720
 I'm about to land the plane right here.

1062
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,860
 Son of God sitting in her living room.

1063
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,260
 What more important person could come over for dinner,

1064
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,420
 or come into your house,

1065
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,620
 and you spend the entire time in the other room?

1066
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,440
 I mean, think about it.

1067
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,420
 This is like if Martin Luther King Jr.,

1068
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,720
 you had a chance to have dinner with him,

1069
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,640
 or Justin Bieber, or Selena,

1070
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,940
 or whoever's your person that you're like,

1071
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,000
 man, if I could only just have them,

1072
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 and hang out with them, and they show up to your house,

1073
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,800
 and you're in the kitchen, just baking cookies or something,

1074
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,340
 while they're in the other room.

1075
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,680
 It's ridiculous.

1076
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,940
 And yet she missed out.

1077
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,040
 And I think that same reality of her missing out,

1078
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,360
 on spending time with the Son of God,

1079
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,840
 is gonna be a reality that many people

1080
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,860
 look back at their 20s, and they look back at their 30s,

1081
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,460
 and they look back at a lot of their life,

1082
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,460
 and they go,

1083
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,660
 I was missing out.

1084
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,620
 What was I doing?

1085
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,840
 I could have been knowing, and deepening,

1086
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,420
 and walking with Jesus, and I chose not to.

1087
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,240
 So here's what I wanna do.

1088
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,680
 I wanna give us a chance for 60 seconds.

1089
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,780
 We're gonna put a verse up on the screen,

1090
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,840
 and I just want you to look at it.

1091
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,780
 And I want you to pray.

1092
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,220
 Right where you are.

1093
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,100
 Don't turn your phone back on.

1094
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,220
 It's gonna be right on the screens,

1095
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,840
 and I just want you to do this.

1096
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,100
 God, help me know where I'm distracted.

1097
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,360
 Help me with my anxious feelings.

1098
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,720
 You say, in the verse we're gonna look at,

1099
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,220
 that your burden is light.

1100
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,620
 Help me to believe that, and experience that,

1101
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,040
 and walk in that.

1102
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,860
 Because you have promised to give me the life of Jesus,

1103
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,040
 and I wanna adopt what living like Jesus looks like.

1104
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,560
 Savior of the world, who was the only person

1105
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,640
 without a Savior complex.

1106
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,040
 And so as that happens,

1107
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,060
 the band will come up in a second,

1108
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,500
 and I just want you to read these verses.

1109
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,000
 I just wanna give you a moment

1110
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,480
 to breathe, and pray,

1111
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,160
 and ask God to deepen and replace the panic

1112
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,100
 at any level in your heart with His peace.

1113
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,560
 And then I'm gonna pray for us.

1114
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,400
 Come back.

1115
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,780
 (gentle music)

1116
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,360
 (gentle music)

1117
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,940
 (gentle music)

1118
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,520
 (gentle music)

1119
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,100
 (gentle music)

1120
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,680
 (gentle music)

1121
00:46:52,680 --> 00:47:01,180
 (gentle music)

1122
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:08,240
 (gentle music)

1123
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:15,280
 (gentle music)

1124
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,040
 (gentle music)

1125
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:44,320
 Father, we live in a world that is constantly bombarding,

1126
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,900
 and fighting for our attention.

1127
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,480
 (gentle music)

1128
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,240
 I know there are friends in the room

1129
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,600
 who are walking through and facing incredible stress,

1130
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,080
 overwhelmed by circumstances,

1131
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,160
 sometimes related to things

1132
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,840
 totally outside of their control, weary.

1133
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,640
 And you promise that those who are weary

1134
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,140
 can come to you and find rest.

1135
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,160
 And so I pray tonight that you would allow that to happen.

1136
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,000
 And those who are tired would be strengthened.

1137
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,320
 Those who are anxious would experience peace

1138
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,900
 that they can't even explain in words.

1139
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,720
 And you would help us to run in line with rhythms

1140
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,560
 that lead to life, not exhaustion.

1141
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,620
 Thank you that you walked on this planet

1142
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,680
 and modeled what that looks like.

1143
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,080
 And you gave your life for us,

1144
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,500
 and you allow us to model life after you.

1145
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,720
 And remember that at the end of the day,

1146
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,380
 there is one thing that matters.

1147
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,700
 Would like Mary, we choose it.

1148
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,100
 In Christ's name, amen.
