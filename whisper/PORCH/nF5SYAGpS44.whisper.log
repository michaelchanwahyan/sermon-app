[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500]   >> All right, let's go.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.000]   Welcome everybody in the room.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Everybody tuning in.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Online.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.500]   And I want to welcome all of our Porch Live locations in particular tonight.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500]   Porch Live Scottsdale, Arizona.

[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.500]   We are continuing this series, Scandals, and looking at some of the family members of Jesus,
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500]   the Savior of the world.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500]   And tonight we're going to look at a guy that actually is so famous that people have depicted
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000]   him in art.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.500]   And one of the more famous pieces of art, let me show it to you right here because it'll
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500]   tell you a little bit about our character.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500]   This is King David.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.000]   And yes, we are keeping it modest as hottest and covering up.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500]   This was created by Michelangelo in 1501.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   You got to know King David is up in heaven like Michelangelo, bro, why you put me on
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500]   blast like that to the entire world?
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.500]   I'm just going to run myself up here and he made this when he was 26 years old, Michelangelo.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   And it was one of the greatest and still is considered one of the greatest pieces of art
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.500]   of all time.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   It was 17 feet tall.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   It weighs six and a half tons.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.500]   And every year over a million people travel to Florence, Italy in order to see it.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500]   And Michelangelo made it out of a single block of marble.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   And to this day, people would say it is the greatest statue of all time.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   It is a picture of perfection and artistry.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500]   But here's what is also true about that statue of David.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   Here, you can put it back up, Alex.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   There is almost zero to little chance that King David looked like this picture.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   In fact, we know that because Michelangelo said, yeah, I based it off of another guy
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   who lived down the road.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   His name was Carl.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   But he had the face going on and that's just what he thought of when he thought of King
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   David.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   And that picture and picturesque and manicured and perfect statue of a chiseled, incredible
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   specimen of a man was not just failing to capture what David actually looked like.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   It also fails to communicate who David actually was.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   Now, King David is the most associated person with Jesus in the Bible.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   In fact, in order to be the Messiah, you had to show that you were actually of the line
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   of King David.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   He was an incredibly important person in the Jewish lineage and he was also an incredibly
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   flawed and broken person who God used in incredible ways.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   And you may not be familiar with that.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   You may have heard the story of David and you're familiar with Goliath and we think
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   of him, he's some hero of the faith.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   But there are some parts of David's stories that Matthew, the disciple of Jesus, when
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   he writes the Gospel of Matthew, he starts by going through the lineage of Jesus we've
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   been walking through.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   And he wants to highlight, not the highlight reel of David's life, but the low light and
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   lowest moment David would have on the planet.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   And in doing so, he very intentionally points us to the point of the Gospel story he's about
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500]   to write.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   So let me read it and it'll make sense and we'll camp out in particular where Matthew
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   highlights.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   Matthew chapter 1, as Matthew launches into the Gospel of Jesus, says, "This is the
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   And then verse 5, we're going to pick up where we left off last week.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   "Now, Salmon was the father of Boaz, Boab, whose mother was Rahab, the prostitute.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of King David."
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   Now, Matthew could have stopped right there.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   I mean, he proved his point.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   All that his audience needed to know is check the box.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   He is related to King David.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   You can't be the Messiah unless you were related to King David.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   King David was so significant in the Jewish mind.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   Inside of the Bible, the only person who's talked about more than King David is Jesus.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   The number of chapters that are written about King David is 62.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   The next closest is Abraham at 14, and then Isaac at 11.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.500]   Elijah, Elijah, most of you guys don't even know the story of Elijah, don't have time to go into it.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   Elijah is one of two people who never died.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   He just went on a chariot and ascended up to heaven.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   He's got 10 chapters written about him, and King David has 62 chapters.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   59 times he's brought up in the New Testament.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   He's the only person called twice a man after God's own heart.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   And Matthew could have stopped at King David, but he goes one step further
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   and brings up the most destructive decision David ever made.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   He says this, "And David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife."
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   Now, if you're Matthew, think about that.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   And you're writing the genealogy of Jesus, and you could go any way you want.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   In that day and age, they rarely brought up women.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   They just had to include the male lineage inside of there.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   And he not only brings up a woman, he twists the knife, if you will, on who?
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   The woman who David had Solomon, King Solomon, with, who she was.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   He doesn't even say her name.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   He says who her husband was.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   Why would Matthew do that?
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Because Matthew, over and over in the lineage, is pointing out,
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.500]   Jesus didn't just come for sinners.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   He came from sinners.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   The most picturesque, perfect person that you could think of in the Bible
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   is, at the end of the day, a broken, fallen person
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   who, just like you, needs a Savior to save them from themselves.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   And he's about to tell these first-century, new baby believers,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   new Christians, some Jewish listeners,
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   how they are going to relate to God no longer on how they behave
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   or their relationship with God doesn't have to have anything to do with what they've done or what they do,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   but it is entirely based on what God has done.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   And so he brings up, you remember David, yeah, yeah, the guy who had that relationship with Bathsheba.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   And I want to walk through that relationship because inside of that story,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   we see some parallels to our own story, our own journey, our own experience in life.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   And we also see something very important about our God.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   So if you didn't grow up in church, I'm going to give you a high-level overview of the story of David.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   I'm going to basically play the movie for the next 20 minutes.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.500]   I'm going to give you two takeaways.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   You'll get out of here in time to go hit the fire pits or whatever we have outside.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   But I'm going to play the movie of David's life.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   Hopefully we have some fire pits outside.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   Here's what happened.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   King David was born around 1,000 years before Jesus, 1,000 years B.C.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   He was born into a very poor family.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   He was the youngest of eight kids.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   At the time, there was a king by the name of anybody know?
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.500]   Saul. That's right, Saul.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   Saul was the king of Israel, and Saul was basically the Disney prince.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   He's a head taller than everybody else.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   He looks like Gaston, and he's, you know, the guy that everybody swoons over.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.500]   True story, it says all the ladies are like, "Oh, man, no one looks like Saul."
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.500]   And they watched, and Saul was that king.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   But God rejected Saul.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   And he tells Samuel, who's the prime minister of the nation,
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   "Saul is the first king, but he won't be the king for long.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   I have chosen another king."
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   And Samuel says, "Okay, where is this other king?"
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   And God says, "Samuel, I want you to go to the town of Bethlehem."
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.500]   And in the town of Bethlehem, there's a family and a father named Jesse.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   And he has sons, and one of those sons is the one that is to be anointed.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   So Samuel gets on his donkey or horse or whatever, shows up at Jesse's house,
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.500]   knocks on the door, "Hey, I'm here to tell you that one of your sons is about to be king of Israel."
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   So Jesse, proud dad to be, is going, "All right, let me get all the boys together."
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   And he lines them all up.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   And Samuel looks at the first son, and it says this.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   "And he looked at Eliab," was his name.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   And Samuel 6, 1 Samuel 16, "When they arrived, he looked at Eliab and thought,
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   'Surely this is the Lord's anointed.'
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.500]   And God nudges him and says, 'That's not him.'
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   So he's like, 'Okay, well, not firstborn, you know, rule follower, it's probably a good thing.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   Let's go to secondborn.' He goes to secondborn.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.500]   And God says, 'It's not him.'
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.500]   He's going, 'All right, we'll move to the thirdborn, kind of middle child.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.500]   I'm sure that, you know, it caused him adversity. He grew through that.'
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   And he goes on and on and on down to seven sons.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   And each time God says, 'It's not him.'
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   And then in almost a comical way, Samuel is going, "Man, it's not any of these."
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   And he asked Jesse what had to be a funny question and incredibly insulting to David.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   And he goes, "Do you have any other sons?"
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   And Jesse, father of the year, is going, "I do have another son. That's right. Yeah.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.500]   Where did I put him?"
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   And he goes, "He's out tending the sheep in the field."
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   And it says this, "Then Samuel asked, 'Are these all the sons that you have?'
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.500]   And Jesse replied, 'I do have the youngest, but he's out in the fields watching sheep and goats.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   Send for him,' Samuel said, 'we won't sit down until he arrives.'
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   So they sent, and Jesse went and got him.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   And he walks in, and David's all sunburned from the sun and sweaty from hanging with sheep and playing the harp.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.500]   And he steps inside, and this teenage kid, God says, 'That's him.'
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:02.500]   Verse 12, "David was dark or ruddy and handsome, with beautiful eyes.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   And the Lord said, 'This is the one. Anoint him.'
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:12.500]   Samuel pours oil on his head," kind of an ancient indicator of God's anointing on somebody.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   And David, you know, is like, "That was weird," and runs back out to carry for the sheep.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   Shortly, a little bit of time goes by, and David's most triumphal moment happens,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   where David shows up, and everybody knows the story, especially his kids.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   We grow up learning about David, and there's this giant named Goliath,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.500]   and this huge nine-foot-tall guy is tormenting the armies of God.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   And David, as a teenage kid, says, "You don't talk to my God and my people like that."
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   And he takes a slingshot that hits David square in the forehead, or hits Goliath square in the forehead, and Goliath dies.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   David becomes a hero, and eventually he's placed in the palace, and he's the king of Israel, from the pastor to the palace.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.500]   And one day, he's in his 30s, he just started to reign at age 30,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   and he's sitting and he's looking in this palace, and David loved God.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   And he's looking out the window of his palace, and this is in 2 Samuel chapter 7,
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   and he goes, "Man, I got this huge crib, and God is over there in a tent.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.500]   We need to build a temple to the Lord."
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   So he begins to go, "How much money do I have?" He's checking his wallet.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.500]   "How do we build a temple?" And God sends a messenger to David that says, "You're not going to build a temple.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.500]   I'm going to build something through you."
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.500]   And he makes an unconditional promise to David.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   Here's what it says, 2 Samuel chapter 7.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.500]   "This is what the Lord of heaven's armies has declared.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   I took you, David, from tending sheep in the pastor, and I selected you to be the leader of my people.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   I have been with you wherever you've gone. I've destroyed all your enemies before your eyes."
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.500]   David had incredible victories and success in military terms.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:03.500]   "And now I will make your fame." This is a promise that today we are evidence of.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.500]   "I will make you as famous as anyone who has ever lived on earth."
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   Now, I don't know how much church background you have.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   My guess is you came to the room, and you've at least heard the name of King David.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.500]   And God fulfilled that promise.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.500]   But there's a much more important promise that traces all the way to Jesus.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   "Furthermore, the Lord says he will make a house for you, a dynasty of kings.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   When you die and are buried with your ancestors, one of your descendants, your own offspring,
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   I will make his kingdom strong.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.500]   He's the one who will build a house, a temple for my name.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   And I will secure his royal throne forever.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   My favor will not be taken from him as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from your sight."
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.500]   Talking about the former king.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   "Your house and your kingdom will continue before me for all time.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   Your throne will be secure forever."
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   So David is promised by God that, "I am going to place the eternal throne,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.500]   and eventually the Savior of the world, the King of kings, will come through you."
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.500]   And he makes a covenant promise to David.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   Now, David had a mountaintop moment with Goliath,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   and this is another mountaintop moment where God makes a huge promise to not just him,
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.500]   but to his children and their children and their children.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   And shortly after that, David's life begins to unravel.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   Now let me tell you a little bit about David in terms of, like, his family structure,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:42.500]   because it's important to understanding the incredible man this was that had incredible flaws.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   Here's the family of King David.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.500]   So David, when I think David, I think Jake Gyllenhaal feels fitting right now.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.500]   And David was married to a girl named Michael.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.500]   Apparently it was a girl named back then.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   David married Michael.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.500]   And when I think Michael, of course, you're going to think T-Swift.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.500]   And David had six other wives.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.500]   He wasn't--God had not told him to do that.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   He didn't obey God.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   And so he ended up married to six other people, which let's just keep it all in the same family
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.500]   and assume that all of them look like T-Swift, just from different eras.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   How much of a horror movie would this be if you were Jake Gyllenhaal
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.500]   and you're married to seven Taylor Swifts?
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.500]   Okay, so anyways, Jake is married, and--I'm kidding.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.500]   That's going to upset all the Swifties who are coming after me now.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   He's married to all of these different women and has a lot of dysfunction in his family as a result of it.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.500]   One of the reasons God outlawed polygamy is because all of the different competition and insecurity
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   and things that happened from having more than one wife and her child and my child
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.500]   and just the infighting that took place, as you would imagine, and it did.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   But all of this was not enough.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   As David one day sees someone who says, "I don't just want these women.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   I want her."
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.500]   And her is Bathsheba.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.500]   And we're going to look more closely at her story.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.500]   But Bathsheba, she's Israeli.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.500]   Let's go with Gal Gadot, okay?
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:17.500]   And David begins to have a relationship with Gal, despite the seven other women in his life.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.500]   And it leads to the destruction of his family and his future.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   Here's the story.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   2 Samuel 11, verse 1.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:34.500]   "In the spring, when kings normally go out to war, King David did not.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   He sent Joab, the commander of the army, and the Israelite army to go fight the Ammonites."
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.500]   David was supposed to be at war.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   We're not told why he stayed home.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.500]   He's still in his 30s.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.500]   He's relatively young.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   So in the spring is when they would go off because in the winter they couldn't go battle or couldn't attack,
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.500]   couldn't fight because the ground, either through snow or through mud, it would just--the wheels couldn't turn.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   So in the spring is when kings would go and the king would ride out to lead his army in battle.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.500]   And David decided, "I'm not going to the battlefield.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.500]   I'm going to hang in the bedroom."
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   "Late one afternoon, after his midday rest," which is a nap,
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   "David got out of bed and was walking along the roof of the palace."
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   This guy is clearly not a very busy man.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.500]   Takes a midday nap, goes on a little stroll on the palace roof.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   "And while he's there, he looked over the city and he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath,
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   who, because God has a sense of humor, turned out to be named Bathsheba.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.500]   And he sent someone to find out who she was."
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.500]   So he looks and he sees a naked woman in a hot tub on top of the roof,
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   and he's looking from his palace balcony saying, "Who is that?"
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.500]   And he sends a servant and he comes back and he goes, "Look at the answer.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:05.500]   That's Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam," who David knew, "and the wife of Uriah."
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.500]   Now that should have been enough for David to go, "Okay, I'm going to go back inside with Taylor Swift and move on."
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.500]   And David doesn't decide to do that.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:21.500]   And he makes a decision that would follow him for the rest of his life.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   David sent messengers to get her, and when she came to the palace, he slept with her.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.500]   David, after they sleep together, sends her away.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   She goes back home, and three weeks later, she sends a message to David, verse 5, that says, "I'm pregnant."
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:47.500]   Uriah is away at battle, fighting for King David, and David just slept with his wife and got her pregnant.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   Not a great scenario.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   And David does what we're all tempted to do in the midst of sin.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.500]   He's faced with a choice.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:03.500]   "I can either confess and come clean, or I can keep going and keep going, because I'm afraid of if I confess, what would happen.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:09.500]   So I'll just keep going and keep going, not knowing it's only going to make the problem worse and worse."
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   So he comes up with a plan.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.500]   He decides, "You know what I'm going to do?
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   I'm going to get Uriah.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   I'm going to bring him home, be like, 'Hey, I just want to celebrate you,' and get him to go home and sleep with his wife.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.500]   No one will ever know.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   No one's counting exactly how many weeks and numbers and all that, and so he'll come home.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500]   She'll get pregnant, and nobody will ever know."
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   So he brings him home, and this is what he says to David.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   "Then he told Uriah, 'Come home and relax.'
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.500]   David sent a gift to Uriah after he left the palace."
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   So Uriah shows up.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   He's like, "Hey, I just want to reward you for being such a faithful guy.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.500]   Go home and sleep with your wife."
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.500]   And Uriah walks out of the palace, and David sends a gift, and he's told he never got the gift.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.500]   Uriah slept at the gate of the king.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.500]   He basically slept outside of the city gates.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.500]   He wouldn't go home.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.500]   David calls him in, and he's like, "Uriah, why didn't you go home?"
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.500]   Uriah says this.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   "What's the matter?" David said.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   Verse 10.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.500]   "Why didn't you go home last night after being away for so long?"
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.500]   Uriah said, "The ark"--the ark of the covenant, which is basically representing the presence of God--
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.500]   "and the armies of Israel are living in tents.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.500]   Joab the commander and my master's men are camping in open fields.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   How could I go home and wine and dine and sleep with my wife?
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   I swear I would never do such a thing."
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.500]   How much did that prick David's heart?
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   As he's looking at a man who says, "I can't go live in comfort while our men are out there fighting for the Lord.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:47.500]   I appreciate you letting me have the night off, but I will not do a thing where I'm going to go home and sleep with her while my men are out in the field."
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   The integrity of Uriah.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   So David decides, "Okay, I'm going to have to bring out the big guns."
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.500]   He brings out some vintage wine, and he says, "Uriah, hang around another night."
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   And this is what it says.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.500]   "We'll stay here today," David told him, "and tomorrow you may return to the army."
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   So Uriah stayed that night with David.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.500]   Verse 13.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   "David invited him to dinner, and he got him drunk."
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   We're not told exactly how or if they're playing some sort of ancient wine pong or something,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:20.500]   but eventually Uriah is to the point where David is like, "All right, hey, I'm going to spin you around and head that way.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.500]   That's where you're going, back to the house."
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   And Uriah still stops at the gate and says, "I'm going to be a bodyguard tonight for the king.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:34.500]   I refuse to go home and live in luxury and comfort while my men are out in the field."
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:40.500]   Uriah has more integrity drunk than David does sober at this moment.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.500]   Now, if I'm God--let me hit pause.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   If this happens, and think about it.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:53.500]   Remember, David has just slept with his wife, and now he's trying to cover it up and cover his tracks,
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   and Uriah has so much integrity that he's saying, "I refuse to do such a thing."
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   If I'm God in this moment, I hit pause and I go, "Okay, Uriah, you're now king.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   David, you're now dead."
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:14.500]   Because Uriah displays the heart of a man that's much more easy to follow
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.500]   and much more resembles Christ, frankly.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.500]   But David decides, "Man, I can't even get him drunk and go home."
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   And he decides what we all have the decision to make in the midst of sin.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   "Man, I'm looking at pornography. Sure, we cross boundaries.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.500]   Man, it was just oral sex. Man, it was just a few drinks.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   Man, it was just a little bit of money.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   Am I going to keep going, or am I going to confess?
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   Am I going to come clean, or am I going to conceal?"
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   And the temptation for all of us in that moment is to think,
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.500]   "Man, if I come clean, that's going to cost me so much."
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   And David, if he was here, would say, "You not coming clean will always cost you more."
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.500]   But he decides, "Man, I can't just bring it out in the open."
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   And he takes it a step further.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   And the next morning, he hands an envelope to Uriah, and he says,
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   "I want you to take this to the general, Joab."
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   And Uriah takes the envelope, says, "Yes, sir," and he rides off.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.500]   And Uriah doesn't realize it, but David had written a note to Joab
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   that basically ensured Uriah's death.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   And Uriah shows up, and he has an envelope, and he's back to the commander,
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   and he says, "This is from the king."
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.500]   And Joab, the general of the army, pulls it out and reads it,
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   and he looks at it, and he reads this.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   "Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:42.500]   Then pull back from him so that he will be killed.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.500]   King David."
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.500]   Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.500]   where he knew the enemy's strongest men were fighting.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.500]   And when the soldiers came out, Uriah and Hittite was killed.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.500]   They put him in the very fiercest area of the battle,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.500]   and then Joab pulled the men back, and Uriah was killed.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.500]   Word is sent back to David, and we don't have time to go into all of it,
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:17.500]   but he's basically told Uriah is dead, and David thinks, "Whew, coast is clear."
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.500]   So he sends word to Bathsheba, and this is what happens next.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   "When Uriah's wife, Bathsheba, heard that her husband was dead, she mourned.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her,
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.500]   brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.500]   Then eight months later, she gave birth to a son."
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.500]   The son was related to David, not Uriah.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   "But the Lord was displeased with what David had done."
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.500]   He kills Uriah. He thinks it's over. Man, that was close.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.500]   What was the time right after that like?
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   "As he holds this baby boy that he knows was born through his sin."
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   Eventually, David may have thought he got away with it, but God saw all of it,
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   and God sends a messenger to King David.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   His name is Nathan the prophet.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   David's hanging out, and one day he gets a knock at the door.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   "Hey, Nathan the prophet has a word from God for you.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.500]   Now, if I'm David and I know I just killed a guy and had sex with his wife,
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   and then I covered up--I mean, think about that.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.500]   The standard--we think of like Bill Clinton having a scandal in the White House.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.500]   This would be synonymous with him taking Monica's husband and killing her.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   I mean, most people wouldn't let David serve in their children's ministry,
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   and yet he's the guy that's writing the Bible. It's astounding.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   And Nathan shows up, and David's got to be nervous of,
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.500]   "What is the prophet going to tell me?"
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   And he launches into a story.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.500]   And David thinks it's just a story. He's telling him something that happened,
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   and he's all leaned in, and here's what Nathan says.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.500]   I love the detail. Nathan, he's over there, he's just cuddling this little lamb.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.500]   One day, a guest arrived at the home of a rich man.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500]   You see the story? Nathan said there's two men,
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.500]   a rich man with all this cattle and sheep, and there's a poor man.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.500]   He doesn't have much. He's got one lamb, and it was like a child to him.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.500]   He loved this one lamb.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.500]   And one day, a guest shows up at the rich man's home,
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.500]   and the rich man says, "Instead of killing from my own flock or herd,
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   I'm going to take the poor man's lamb, and he killed it,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.500]   and he prepared it for his guest."
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   And David is listening to this story
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   and feels what all of us would feel of the injustice, and it says,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   "David was furious," verse 5,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:15.500]   "as the Lord lives, any man who would do such a thing deserves to die."
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:21.500]   He just went level 10 DEF CON over a lamb.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.500]   "He must replay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.500]   and for having no pity.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.500]   And Nathan said to David, looked him in the eye,
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.500]   'You are the man.'"
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   The Lord, the God of Israel, says,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.500]   "I anointed you King of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.500]   I gave your master's house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   If that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.500]   Why have you despised the word of the Lord and done this horrible deed?
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.500]   You have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.500]   and stolen his wife."
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.500]   From this time on, and then he lays into the sentence
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.500]   that that decision would carry out in David's life.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   "From this time on, your family will live by the sword
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   because you have despised God by taking Uriah's wife to be your own."
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.500]   This is what the Lord says, "Because what you have done,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.500]   I will cause your own household, your family, to rebel against you.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.500]   He will go to bed with them in public view.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:41.500]   You did it in secret, but I will make this happen openly in the sight of all of Israel."
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.500]   Then David confessed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the Lord."
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:52.500]   Nathan replied, "Yes, the Lord has forgiven you.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.500]   You won't die for this sin.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.500]   Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the Lord by doing this,
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.500]   your child will die."
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.500]   The little baby that David had been holding was struck by a disease,
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   and seven days later he was dead.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   That was just the beginning.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   David's family, like it was told,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.500]   "A consequence for your rebellion and your sin is that your family will be in turmoil."
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.500]   What happens next, we don't have time to go into all of it, but it is so crazy.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   David's example as a bad father pops everywhere.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   What do I mean by that?
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:33.500]   He has an oldest son named Amnon who has this weird obsession with his younger half-sister.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   It's creepy and weird looking back, but he's like, "Man, I'm just in love. I'm obsessed."
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   He can't have that relationship, so one day he rapes her.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.500]   He rapes his half-sister.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:53.500]   It's discovered, and King David does nothing.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   This upset him, but he doesn't do what a good father would do.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.500]   That enrages David's other son named Absalom.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.500]   Absalom says, "If my own father is not going to do something to protect my sister,
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.500]   then I'll do something."
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.500]   He comes up with a plan, and these are David's two sons
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.500]   fighting over the sister that had been raped by one of them.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.500]   Absalom, who is the most handsome and attractive of all of David's children,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:25.500]   says, "I'm going to defend my sister if my dad won't," and he kills his brother.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.500]   It only gets worse from there.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.500]   Absalom knows that, "Man, I just killed this man,"
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.500]   so he takes off like he's Simba in The Lion King
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.500]   and goes to live for three years by himself.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.500]   Eventually, David goes, "You can come back home.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.500]   You don't have to be a fugitive."
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.500]   But David still does not give us the example of a good father.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.500]   He says, "You can come back home, but I don't want to see you."
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.500]   Absalom comes back home, and Absalom continues to go,
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   "My father is a failure as a dad.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.500]   He does not deserve to be king for the actions he has taken."
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.500]   So he begins to recruit an army, and Absalom puts together this army.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.500]   This army all of a sudden becomes so powerful that Absalom goes,
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.500]   "Man, we're going to take on the city."
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   He begins to march and declare civil war against King David, his own father.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.500]   David doesn't want Jerusalem to be burned, so he goes,
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.500]   "All right, I'm going to get all my posse, and we're going to go out
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   and basically live in the wilderness until we can kind of assemble our troops
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500]   and get things ready."
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500]   David still loved Absalom.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   Absalom finds himself sitting in the palace, and he's like,
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500]   "Man, that's pretty nice. I mean, look at this chair. This is great.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   They've got these little drinks with the umbrellas in them, and I'm king."
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   He declares himself king.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.500]   Then his advisor tells him to do something that's further fulfillment of this prophecy.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.500]   He says, "You know what you should do?
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.500]   You should really show the people"--this is like my own translation--
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.500]   "But basically, you should really show the people that you're showing
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.500]   your middle finger to your dad, and you should have sex on the roof
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.500]   with his concubines."
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   So they set up a tent on the roof of the White House,
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.500]   and Absalom goes in and has sex with David's concubines
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.500]   to show them, "Hey, there is no reconciliation that is going to take place."
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.500]   I mean, think about that.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   It's hard to sit down at a Thanksgiving table after you've gone through that.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.500]   Absalom decides even this is not enough, and he marches out in the wilderness
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   to go find David and kill his father.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500]   And King David is heartbroken over this.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   He doesn't want Absalom to die, but they go to war,
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   and Absalom dies in the process.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.500]   David would lose four children as a result of his decision to sleep with Bathsheba.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   Four.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500]   David is reinstated as king, and he goes back,
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   and another son named Adonijah makes an attempt at the throne.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.500]   I mean, over and over and over.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   He does not act like a good--he was a failure as a father to his children.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.500]   Incredible hero on the war battlefield and a failure at home.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   And then on his own deathbed in 1 Kings 2, which we don't have time to go in,
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   David is dying, and he looks at Solomon, who is now the new king,
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   and he says, "I want you to do something."
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.500]   And he says, "There's two men who I don't want you to let live
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.500]   to have gray hair and go to the grave in peace."
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   He's like a mob boss dying and saying, "Hey, you know what to do. Take them out."
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.500]   That's what he does. That's literally what he does.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.500]   He doesn't even say, "Kill them." He literally says, "You know what to do."
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.500]   He's like, "You know not to let them go in peace to the grave."
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   That's my best mob boss.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   And David, over and over at every turn, he had some incredible triumphs
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   and incredible mountaintops and incredible valleys.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500]   And so what does all of this have to do with us?
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.500]   And why would Matthew go out of his way to highlight the decision
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   that had so much destruction in David's life?
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   There's two takeaways that I really want to walk through very quickly
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.500]   as we think about this text.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   There's two very simple things that are so applicable and relevant
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   to you and I's life.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   One of them is about us, in particular, sin, and the other one is about God.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:54.500]   And the first one is this, very simply, that sin always has consequences.
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   Sin always has consequences.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.500]   The temptation in that moment is you're going, "Man, it's just sex one time.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.500]   It's just not that big of a deal.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   It's just pornography one time.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.500]   It's just one last time.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.500]   It's just crossing boundaries a little bit physically.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.500]   It's just taking a little bit financially and kind of cutting the corners
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.500]   here and there."
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:17.500]   And David would say, "Sin always has consequences."
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500]   The Bible says that the wages of sin is death.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.500]   The payment you get for sin every time and I get for sin every single time
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   is death.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   How can that make sense?
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   You ever read that verse in like death, like if I steal something,
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.500]   I'm going to explode or I'm going to die?
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   How does that bring death?
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   Well, David's own story shows us sin always brings death,
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.500]   not just physically, but death in emotional ways, spiritual ways.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.500]   David's sin led to the death of his family.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.500]   Some of you this week is going to be really painful because Thanksgiving
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.500]   and Christmas and holidays, they bring up all the fracturedness
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   in your family, the brokenness because of your parents' divorce
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.500]   that was a result of sin that led to the death of their marriage,
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   that led to the death of your relationship with your dad.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:07.500]   That sin ultimately and always brings about and kills things that it touches.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   Some of your faith, you know, you went through college
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   and you used to have a faith and you were in high school
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   and you kind of like walked with God and then you went through this season
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   where you just walked away from him and it wasn't that God changed it,
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   that you just continued to go down a path with other people
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   and you went from, "Man, I'm worshiping on the weekends,"
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   "I'm a weekend warrior and I don't even know if I believe in God anymore."
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.500]   And it led to the death of your relationship with God.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.500]   And David would say sin always has consequences.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.500]   It did then, it does now, it can lead to the death of your freedom.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.500]   That's what addiction is.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.500]   I want to be free in order to do whatever I want whenever I want
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   and all of a sudden now I'm not free.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.500]   I can't go this long without drinking.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   I can't go this long without pornography.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.500]   I can't go this long without a hookup.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.500]   Because it led to the death of your freedom.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.500]   And David would say it always brings about death.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   And it doesn't come in the form of something that you can always tell.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500]   It just looks like, "Man, this isn't that big of a deal,"
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   and it's just kind of one subtle look.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:13.500]   And all of a sudden, step by step, brings destruction.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   In Alaska, there's a common way that Eskimos will kill wolves
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   and they do so in order to keep wolves away from just either camping ground
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.500]   or for whatever reason.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.500]   And the way that they do it is they take a knife and they go to the shore
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   and they find a seal and they stab the seal.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   And they get the blood of the seal on that knife.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.500]   And then they take the knife and they go over to the snow
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.500]   and they roll it in the snow and then they repeat the process
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   and repeat the process until eventually they have a huge seal blood popsicle
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   with a knife inside of it.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.500]   They take that popsicle knife and they go and they put it in the snow.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   And wolves will smell the scent of that blood.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.500]   And Eskimos will be relatively close to the popsicle,
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   but the wolves don't care because they care only about the scent of that blood.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500]   They care only about that thing.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   And then the wolves will go up to that blood popsicle with a knife on the inside of it
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   and they'll start to lick it and they'll start to lick it and they'll start to lick it.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   And eventually, all of the snow or the seal blood moves away
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.500]   and the wolf continues to lick and it's licking the knife.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.500]   And it cuts its mouth open until it bleeds out and it dies.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   And once it doesn't even realize, it's gone past the point of no return.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   And I think if David was here, he would say,
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   "The best option you have and I have is at every turn, wherever you're at,
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   you think you're too far gone, you're not too far gone,
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.500]   but the best cure that you have is doing what David did eventually,
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   coming clean and confessing."
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   James 5:16 says, "By confessing, we bring healing into our life."
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.500]   Galatians 6 says that, "Whatever a man sows, he will reap."
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.500]   That God is not mocked.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   And you cannot live a certain way, date a certain way,
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   feed your mind certain thoughts, certain images, certain things,
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   and it not impact who you are.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   I wish that as a pastor, I could say that this is something that I don't have to struggle with
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   or have to battle with anymore.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   Like, man, I'm happily married, I've moved on.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   I don't ever have lustful thoughts, I don't ever struggle with pride or anger,
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.500]   or just temptation in general, but I can't.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.500]   That I, every day, have a choice.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.500]   If I find myself still tempted with, man, there's a beautiful girl that walks by
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.500]   who bends over to pick something up, or somebody on Instagram that clicks something,
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   and I know that, man, I just want to see who they are,
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.500]   because it kind of looks like there's cleavage in their profile picture.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   In that moment, I have a choice to either say, "I need to confess this
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   and share with my own small group guys, 'Hey, does this happen?
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.500]   I'm having images that are going through my mind,'" or whatever the struggle is.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   I have a choice.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   Am I going to bring this out in the light, or am I going to try to carry it on my own?
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   And David would say, "As long as you and I try to carry it on our own,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   we live it in secrecy.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   It's not going away."
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.500]   And I have to make that choice every single day.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   I was like, "Nine years happily married, you don't struggle with that stuff anymore."
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.500]   It's just not the truth.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:13.500]   And King David, who wrote so much of the Bible, if nothing else, testifies to that.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.500]   And we heal by bringing it into the light.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   My son, we went on a camp out a few weeks ago, and he came back,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.500]   and he had all these different stickers that were in his feet,
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.500]   and he had splinters basically as a result of it,
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.500]   and they were causing little infections.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   And as a five-year-old, you don't really understand that,
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   but he said, "I need to take these tweezers and pull those out."
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.500]   Because in his mind, he's just like, "Oh, I'm okay.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   I can live the rest of my life without these things.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.500]   It'll be fine."
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.500]   But in my mind, I know it's not going to get better until you get it out.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.500]   And the same is true with sin,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.500]   that it doesn't get better in your life and in my life until it gets out.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.500]   And God's not up there being like, "Man, own up, because I just want you to be embarrassed."
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.500]   He's going, "I care about what sin does to you and to me,
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.500]   and I want you to experience healing."
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.500]   So sin always has consequences.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   And then the second thing, very simply,
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.500]   is that God always keeps his covenants.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.500]   This ultimately is a story about God.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.500]   I mean, if you're reading this story and you go,
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   "Why did God not strike him with lightning?"
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.500]   I mean, the number of things that David does that other kings didn't do that were removed for.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.500]   I mean, Saul, you know why Saul was removed as king?
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.500]   He took a census, and he didn't kill somebody.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   David kills somebody after he sleeps with his wife,
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.500]   and you would think that God would be up there and be like, "Okay, we're going to move."
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   David gives them every reason in the world to say,
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   "I'm actually not going to keep that covenant with you."
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   I remember being in seminary, and this really messing with me,
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   because you read the Old Testament, and we don't have time to go into these stories,
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   but Hezekiah, he lights basically a candle, and God removes him from authority, or brings consequences.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.500]   There's just men who do things where you're like,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:12.500]   "Why would God say, 'Deal breaker, but David does the worst of anybody in the family line of Jesus, and he's your boy?'"
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.500]   And it wasn't until recently I realized why.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.500]   Because God keeps His covenants.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   It wasn't about David.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   You know what a covenant is? It's an unconditional promise.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.500]   That regardless of what you do, I'm going to keep my promise.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.500]   Now, does that mean sin doesn't have consequences? No.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   Sin always has consequences.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.500]   You can have sex with her. That doesn't mean you're going to go to hell.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:43.500]   It may mean you get herpes, but you're not going to hell.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.500]   If you are in the covenant family of God,
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.500]   because people say, "Oh man, there's going to be consequences. Does He remove?"
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   No. You can murder someone, and it doesn't mean you're necessarily going to hell.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.500]   You're probably going to jail.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:02.500]   But if you're in Christ, which would be an unusual behavior for a follower of Jesus,
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.500]   but God always keeps His covenant, and Matthew is highlighting the point.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   The relationship you and I have been invited to with God has nothing to do with how you behave.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.500]   You can no longer approach Him based on that.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.500]   It has everything to do with the covenant God has entered into with us.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.500]   The unconditional promise. What is the unconditional promise?
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.500]   Whosoever, John 3, verse 16, the most famous verse in the room, anybody probably knows.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:35.500]   Whoever believes in Jesus will not perish but have eternal life.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:41.500]   Not whoever behaves for Jesus will not perish but have eternal life.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   The moment Jesus taught, His followers taught, the church has always taught,
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.500]   when you believe, you accept Jesus on the cross died for your sin.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:56.500]   Everything, stuff you don't even know you're going to do in March of 2023, paid for.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.500]   When you accept Jesus, you on the cross, you paid for me.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   You died in my place, and you rose again as payment for my sin.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:10.500]   Boom. You're in the covenant family of God, and our God keeps His covenant.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.500]   The covenant is an unconditional promise.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   The reason why David was not removed from the throne despite failure after failure
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.500]   is God keeps His promises.
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.500]   He has promised to you and I in Christ,
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   there is nothing you can do that would make Him remove you from the covenant of God
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   or the family of God.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   There's nothing you could not do that would keep you out of it
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:41.500]   if you receive and accept Jesus' payment on the cross for you.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   What do I mean by covenant contract?
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.500]   A contract is something where it's like, basically, if you do this, then I'll do that.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.500]   A contract is what I have with AT&T, where if I can get a better deal, better service,
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.500]   I would move very quickly to Verizon or whatever other service.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.500]   That's contract.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   A covenant is akin to marriage.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.500]   It's an unconditional promise.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.500]   Next week is my wife and I's nine-year anniversary.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.500]   Nine years ago, almost to the day.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.500]   Yeah, thank you for that.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.500]   Thank you.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.500]   Golf clap for that.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.500]   Nine years ago, almost to the day, we stood at an altar, her in a white dress,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   me in a black suit and said, "I promise unconditionally to love you until death do we part."
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   God has entered into a covenant with anyone who will simply accept Jesus
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:24.500]   and the message of David and the reason Matthew, as he's writing out,
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.500]   "And David was the father of Solomon,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.500]   whose mother had been another man's wife,"
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.500]   is to highlight our God keeps his promises
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.500]   and the behavior of the people who know him and walk with him
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   has nothing to do with the faithfulness of God.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   He is faithful when they are not.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:52.500]   He is a covenant-keeping, promise-keeping God.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   And Matthew includes to point that all of these men are sinners that led to a Savior.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.500]   Their lives point not to the heroics of themselves,
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.500]   but their desperate need for a Savior.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:09.500]   That's the point in every turn of David's story.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.500]   And if David was here, he'd say, "It's not about me. It's about Jesus."
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.500]   If Rahab was here, she would say, "It's not about me. It's about Jesus."
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   It all points and was meant to point to him.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   Finally, David models something that's really, really important.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   Some of you guys in the room, you feel like, "Man, you're in an affair.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.500]   You never told anybody that, but you've had one. You're in the middle of one.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.500]   There's an abortion that you don't even really want to have, but someone was a part of that.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.500]   They kind of make it seem like it's not that big of a deal.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.500]   It's a morning-after pill, and who cares?
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.500]   It'd be worse to bring the child into this."
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.500]   And you made a decision, and it's haunted you every day since then.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.500]   And you carry around a guilt and a shame.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   Maybe there's a current struggle that you, candidly, you think you're going to die with.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.500]   You think you're going to bring it to the grave.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.500]   You think there's no option but to bring it to the grave.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.500]   You think if I brought it into the light like David felt, there's no way.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   The confession consequences are going to be way worse than if I just keep going.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:10.500]   And David would invite you.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.500]   You can be free.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.500]   You can experience healing.
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   You can experience soul forgiveness, washed, in his words, "white as snow,"
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.500]   by bringing that to God.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:32.500]   Right after he committed adultery with Bathsheba, he says in Psalm 51,
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.500]   he writes, and I'm laying on the plane right here, he writes something incredibly beautiful.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.500]   Maybe the night after Nathan said, "You are the man."
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.500]   Psalm 51 starts like this.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   "A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him,
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   'I know my transgressions,' David said.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   'My sin is always in front of me.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   I know I am messed up.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.500]   But I will be clean.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   Wash me, God, and I will be whiter than snow.'"
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:09.500]   You do not delight in sacrifice or in good deeds or in church attendance
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   or in reading my Bible or in giving to church.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.500]   You don't delight in those things or I would give it.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.500]   Those are not the things that God wants.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:25.500]   The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.500]   God, you will not despise.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.500]   And David cries out to God, "I am broken.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.500]   Will you forgive me?"
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.500]   If there was something I could do that would earn it, I would do it, but there isn't.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   Will you forgive me?
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   And if you will follow in David's steps tonight,
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:50.500]   what you will experience rushing in is the forgiveness of God.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.500]   And your life doesn't have to be defined by those things.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   And if you've trusted in Jesus,
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.500]   no matter where you are in the spectrum for the rest of your life,
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   you could rest confidently where you're going to spend eternity with God
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   because you're part of the covenant family.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   And our God keeps his covenants, his promise,
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.500]   his unconditional promise to those who are in Jesus.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   Let me pray.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.500]   Father, I thank you for every person here.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.500]   And I pray that you would allow the story of David,
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.500]   the truth that all of us are broken and in need of a Savior
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.500]   to pierce through anyone who has never heard, believed, accepted that.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.500]   And you would welcome them into the covenant relationship
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   that you have invited everyone who's ever lived into.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   And that you would pierce through people who believe lies right now.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:48.500]   They feel like they're overwhelmed with shame and guilt.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   That your forgiveness would flood their hearts and their minds
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.500]   and bring freedom and peace.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.500]   A freedom and peace that only you can give.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.500]   We worship you in song. Amen.
