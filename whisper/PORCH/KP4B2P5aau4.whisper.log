[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.040]   - Well, what's up, Porch?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.040]   How we doing tonight?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.240]   Hey, it's good to see you.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.440]   My name is Timothy Atik.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.420]   I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.320]   on Sundays as well as Tuesday nights.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.000]   If this is your first time here ever
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.120]   or your last time here ever,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.080]   I'm so glad that you made it.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.200]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.840]   I know that we've got people watching
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080]   all over the nation right now.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.840]   So just want to say hello to Porch Life Boise,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.960]   Porch Life Indianapolis, Porch Life Cincinnati.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.640]   So glad that you guys are tracking with us tonight.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.180]   So I have a goal in life.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.400]   And my goal is to be the GOAT.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.160]   Not just of life in general.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.900]   I want to be the GOAT, the greatest of all time,
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.440]   in the 42-year-old age bracket of tennis
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.140]   in Richardson, Texas.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.880]   Like that's, I don't feel like that's too much to ask.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.360]   That's just my goal.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.680]   I love tennis.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.300]   My journey with tennis is that I played when I was a kid
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.100]   and then I stepped away from it for over three decades.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.480]   And then I read a biography by Andre Agassi,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.240]   a famous tennis player from a long time ago.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.140]   And then I decided at the age of 40,
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.580]   I'm going to become the GOAT.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.600]   It was at the 40-year-old age bracket.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.440]   And since that didn't happen at 40 or 41,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.360]   we're onto 42 now.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.580]   And the goal is to be the GOAT,
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.580]   42-year-old age bracket of tennis in Richardson, Texas.
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.860]   The only problem, thank you.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.960]   Y'all are applauding too much tonight.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.240]   It's getting to the point where it's like, let's just stop.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.420]   But anyway, the problem,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540]   the only problem with me becoming the GOAT,
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.020]   and you're like, pink grip.
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.120]   Yes, pink grip.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.220]   It's intimidation.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.220]   Anyway, the only problem,
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180]   the only roadblock to me becoming the GOAT
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.700]   is that I can't hit a forehand.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.020]   That is the only thing standing in my way.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.220]   Because when I was in sixth grade,
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.940]   I still remember where I was at PE
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.540]   when I lost all hand-eye coordination.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.200]   That's why I became a runner,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.740]   because I didn't have to use my hands.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.120]   I just had to put one foot in front of the other
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.300]   as fast as possible.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.960]   I can't, I really struggle to hit a forehand.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.780]   For some reason, when I come through,
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.300]   my right hand freaks out and literally,
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.900]   like I'll come through and it will do that.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.980]   It will literally come through
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.300]   to where when I make contact with the ball,
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.900]   it'll either hit it there,
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.940]   or somehow it'll hit it there,
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.260]   or there, if you're not into tennis,
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.140]   where your racket is facing is usually where the ball goes.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.860]   So when it's pointed that way,
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.140]   you can imagine where it goes.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.140]   It's been very problematic on my journey
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.540]   to becoming the GOAT.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.860]   That's why I began to spend time with a guy named John.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.260]   John was a professional tennis player,
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.560]   and now he teaches tennis for a living.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   He's the director of a tennis club here in Dallas.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.520]   And so I began to spend time with John,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.060]   and it was amazing because in just one time with John,
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.600]   I showed him what I was doing,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   and he was like, "Okay, here's the deal."
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.420]   Like he walked over to me, he grabbed my arm.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.860]   He was like, "Stop doing that.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.100]   "Start doing this, do this, change that."
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.380]   And in a matter of 15 minutes,
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.780]   I could hit a forehand.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.380]   And I was like, "Praise God."
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.460]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.380]   That's all I wanted to share with you guys tonight.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.380]   I'm gonna pray, and then we'll get out of here.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.080]   But here's the reality.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.740]   The reason I tell you that is because for many of us,
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.700]   that's our experience with prayer.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.420]   We're in a series right now that we're calling prayer,
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.620]   how to talk to and hear from God.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.740]   And the reality is for many of you,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.620]   your prayer life is kind of like
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.300]   my tennis life prior to John.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.700]   It just feels awkward.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.100]   You don't really know what you're doing.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.320]   You don't know how to do it.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.740]   You feel like you're doing it wrong,
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.140]   so you just don't do it.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.180]   And so what I wanna do tonight
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.500]   is I kind of wanna be John in your life,
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.840]   where I wanna just come beside you and say,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.120]   "Hey, don't do this.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.620]   "Start doing this."
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.060]   And just in no time at all,
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.260]   you can go from not doing it to doing it
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.940]   and actually enjoying it.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.780]   So if you're here tonight and you don't pray at all,
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.640]   you're not a Christian.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.020]   You got tricked into being here tonight.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.960]   Like my hope is just that you would start praying.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.100]   And if you pray occasionally,
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.420]   my hope is that you might begin to pray regularly.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.380]   And if you pray regularly,
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.080]   my hope is that you might begin to pray constantly.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.080]   That you might begin to take new ground
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.320]   and you might actually listen,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   begin to, you might begin to tap into the joy of prayer.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.240]   So question for you,
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.340]   if we were to sit down and coffee and I were to say,
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.000]   "Hey, what's one word that describes your prayer life?"
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.080]   Do you think that the one word you would choose
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.060]   of all the words in the English language,
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.440]   do you think that you would choose the word enjoyable?
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.140]   What if that could be true?
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.420]   What if you would say,
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.480]   "Prayer is actually enjoyable.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.400]   "When I pray, I connect with the living God,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.060]   "the creator of the universe."
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.480]   That is possible for you tonight.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.000]   So here's what I wanna do.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.320]   Tonight is gonna be very practical.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   I just wanna answer two questions tonight.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.580]   The first question is, why should you pray?
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.640]   Why should you pray?
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.440]   And if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.320]   I'm so glad that you made it.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.640]   And I am so excited to answer for you,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.240]   especially the question of why you should even pray.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.040]   But then I also wanna answer the question,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.000]   how should you pray?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.280]   Like I wanna just get very practical
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.920]   and I'm gonna end up giving you seven different ways
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.100]   that you can go out and pray
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.080]   and hopefully begin to gain some traction
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.340]   in enjoying praying with God.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.240]   So I wanna answer the question first,
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.220]   why should you pray?
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.260]   Why should you pray?
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.100]   Two reasons.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.100]   One, Jesus prayed.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.840]   Jesus prayed.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.220]   So if you're a follower of Jesus Christ and Jesus prayed,
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.840]   if you're gonna follow Jesus as a follower of Jesus,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.740]   that kinda makes sense.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.180]   If you're gonna call yourself a follower,
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.420]   then you should probably follow.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.760]   If Jesus prayed, we should pray.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   The second reason is that prayer is how we get more of God.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.220]   Prayer is how we get more of God.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.260]   So let's just unpack that.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.100]   Why should you pray?
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.820]   First, Jesus prayed.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.640]   And if you consider yourself a Christian,
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.460]   it's just good for us to understand
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.300]   what the goal of the Christian life is.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.860]   The goal of the Christian life
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.760]   is to look more and more like Jesus every single day.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.260]   Like a guy named Dallas Willard,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260]   he defined discipleship,
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.960]   which is just a big word for the process of following Jesus
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.380]   or being a Christian.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.980]   Here's what he said discipleship is.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.100]   He said, "Discipleship is the process
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.460]   of becoming who Jesus would be if he were you."
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.180]   That's just saying that if you consider yourself a Christian
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.540]   then the goal of your life is to become
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.620]   who Jesus would be if he were you.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.120]   Jesus prayed.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.820]   So if you're going to follow Jesus,
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.260]   then if Jesus prayed, then we should pray as well.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.160]   As I was preparing for this message,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.040]   I just walked through the book of Luke.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.480]   And I really had not grasped this
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.080]   until preparing for this message.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.000]   But as I walked through the book of Luke
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.360]   and I just began to notice all of the different times
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.440]   that Jesus prayed, you know what I was blown away by?
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.000]   And I understood this really from talking to a friend
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.160]   who had done the same kind of research.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.580]   Here's what I realized.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.520]   Jesus Christ, the God of the universe, God in the flesh,
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.760]   he prayed before, during, and after,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.760]   or after anything significant that happened in his ministry.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.040]   God in the flesh prayed before, during, or after
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.640]   anything significant that happened.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.120]   Let me just walk you through some of it.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.560]   And if you have a Bible and you want to turn
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.740]   to the book of Luke, you can track along with me.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.480]   It starts, you know, Jesus's ministry really started
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.220]   around the age of 30.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.800]   This is before his ministry even started, at his baptism.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.760]   I don't know if you know this,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.640]   but Jesus Christ got baptized.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.240]   And it says this, "Now when all the people were baptized,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   "and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.660]   "the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.640]   "descended on him in bodily form like a dove.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.100]   "And a voice came from heaven,
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.360]   "you are my beloved son, with you I am well pleased."
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.100]   So just imagine, at his baptism,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.920]   before his ministry even starts, Jesus is praying.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.680]   And what happens as he's praying?
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.600]   The Spirit of God descends on him like a dove.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.880]   And God the Father speaks audibly from heaven,
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.120]   declaring his delight and his pleasure in Jesus Christ.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.400]   And then Jesus starts his ministry,
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.200]   and Jesus gets in a rhythm.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.920]   Do you know what that rhythm is?
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.560]   He heals a bunch of people, and then he withdraws to pray.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.840]   You see this at various points in the Gospels.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.520]   He heals, spends the whole day healing,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.160]   and then he withdraws to pray.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.560]   And then I think about when he is making a big decision,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.100]   which is he is choosing his 12 disciples,
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.840]   the people he will spend every day with for three years.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.860]   And before he makes a big decision,
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.720]   listen to what it says in Luke chapter six,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.060]   verses 12 and 13.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.000]   It says, "And these days he went out
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.060]   "to the mountain to pray,
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:47.060]   "and all night he continued in prayer to God.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.220]   "And when day came, he called his disciples
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.000]   "and chose from them 12 whom he named apostles."
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.400]   What do you do when you need to make a big decision?
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   Some of you are here tonight, and you're like,
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.960]   "Yeah, I'm in the middle of needing to make a big decision."
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.440]   You're trying to figure out if the person you're dating
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.560]   is the person that you are going to marry.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.820]   And it's kind of reached that point in the relationship
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.980]   where it's either gonna end in marriage
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.280]   or it's just gonna end.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.480]   And so you're trying to figure that out right now.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.720]   Or you're trying to figure out if the job that you're in
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.080]   is the job you wanna stay in.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.680]   Some of you right now are trying to figure out
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.640]   if you're gonna move away from Dallas.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.040]   Some of you guys are dealing with debt,
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.280]   and you're trying to figure out what you need to do
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.120]   with your finances.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.140]   Others of you are trying to figure out
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.720]   if you're gonna go back to school and get your MBA.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.040]   Some of you are dealing with tough stuff in your family,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.240]   and you're just trying to navigate
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.040]   significant things in your family.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.160]   Or maybe you've been running with the wrong people,
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.280]   and you're just trying to make a hard decision.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.800]   Are these the people that I need to be spending
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.840]   my 20s with?
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.080]   So how do you navigate hard decisions?
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.440]   Maybe you make a pros and cons list.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.000]   Maybe you talk to some of your trusted friends.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.320]   Some of you are hitting up chat GPT.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.180]   You're like, I don't know, what do you think, AI?
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.360]   What did Jesus do?
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.660]   The God of the universe spent all night praying.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.120]   Have you ever considered that?
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.720]   Like you literally, you're like,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.440]   I guess I'm just gonna pray all night.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.640]   That's the best thing I could do to make a decision.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.760]   That's what Jesus did.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.480]   And he was God.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.920]   And then you keep moving in Luke,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.760]   and you get to the feeding of the 5,000,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.820]   which is a very famous story
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.080]   where Jesus takes a little kid's lunchbox
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.320]   and turns a meal for one into a meal
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.660]   for thousands of people.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.680]   It's crazy.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.840]   And what does he do right before he distributes the food?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.680]   He blesses it, he prays to God.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.760]   What does he do after the feeding of the 5,000?
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.000]   What do you see him doing?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.800]   You find him praying.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.600]   Before Jesus taught the Lord's Prayer,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.160]   which we studied last week,
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.460]   it's a very famous passage of the Bible.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.320]   A good amount of people in this room
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   have the Lord's Prayer memorized.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.600]   What does Jesus do before he teaches his disciples
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.400]   the Lord's Prayer?
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.480]   He prays.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.600]   Listen to what it says.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.160]   Luke chapter 11.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.400]   Now Jesus was praying in a certain place.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.280]   And when he finished, one of his disciples said to him,
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.960]   "Lord, teach us to pray," as John taught his disciples.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.420]   This is pretty interesting.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.200]   Here's why this is interesting, don't miss it.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.340]   That the people that are asking Jesus
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.400]   to teach them how to pray, they are Jews.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   Prayer was a major part of being a Jew.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.680]   Like, kids were raised learning and knowing how to pray.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.760]   Like, prayer was a part of different festivities.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.480]   It was a key mark in the nation of Israel.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.480]   And yet these people who had grown up saying prayers,
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.720]   they see Jesus pray and they're like,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.320]   "Yeah, I don't know how to pray like that.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.660]   "Jesus, would you teach me how to pray?
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.360]   "Would you just act like I don't know anything?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.720]   "And would you take me to school?
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.260]   "And would you teach me,
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.440]   "because if that's what real prayer is, teach me to pray."
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.100]   And Jesus says, "Okay, pray then like this,
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.500]   "our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.000]   Jesus, if you read the book of Luke,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.480]   there's this big chunk in the book of Luke
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.640]   where Jesus teaches in parables.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.960]   A parable was like a story that was hard to understand.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.560]   We're actually starting a series on parables
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.440]   this Sunday morning here at Watermark.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.880]   And I'd encourage you to come and join us on Sundays.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.880]   But Jesus devotes an entire parable to the topic of prayer.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.320]   And then you get to the night that Jesus is arrested.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.800]   Like that's the climax of his ministry
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.440]   where Jesus is arrested, he dies, he's buried,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.000]   and he rises from the dead.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.080]   Like that's why we're here.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.880]   If you're not a Christian and you're like,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.920]   "What are all these people doing here?"
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.040]   Like this is just a, like, "Do y'all just do this one time?"
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.160]   No, we do this every Tuesday night.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.800]   Why?
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.440]   Because we're not just trying to be better people.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Our story is that we were spiritually dead people
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.260]   and we've been made alive.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.360]   Like we believe that we have life with God
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.240]   because Jesus did something very significant.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.460]   He lived the life that we couldn't live.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.020]   He died the death that we all deserve to die
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:49.020]   because no one on the planet has lived a perfect life
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.460]   that God requires.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.500]   Jesus lived a perfect life in our place.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.860]   He was buried and then he rose from the dead as a display
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.940]   that his sacrifice was enough
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.140]   so that we could be made right with God.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.460]   Right before Jesus went to the cross to die,
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.080]   he was first arrested.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.720]   And right before he's arrested,
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.460]   what do we find Jesus doing?
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.300]   He's praying.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.980]   Here's what it says in Luke 22.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.080]   "When he came to the place, he said to them," his friends,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.500]   "Pray that you may not enter into temptation.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.940]   And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.800]   and he knelt down and prayed, saying,
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.820]   'Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.060]   Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done.'"
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.300]   I'm so thankful Jesus prayed that prayer
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.720]   where he just, that is such a powerful prayer
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.900]   where he just says, "Not my will, your will be done.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.060]   Father, you sent me to take away the sins of the world.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.740]   You sent me to take away the sins of the people
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.100]   that would gather at the porch on this night in May.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.240]   Your will be done."
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.180]   And then just a few verses later in verse 44, it says,
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.420]   "In being in agony, he prayed more earnestly
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.860]   and his sweat became like great drops of blood
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.740]   falling down to the ground."
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.660]   The God of the universe sweat blood as he prayed.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.940]   And if you're here and you're like,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.300]   "Jesus is so irrelevant to my life."
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.020]   I just wonder if you find yourself in a moment
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.820]   where everything is hitting the fan.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.820]   Like your parent has received a cancer diagnosis.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.740]   Maybe you've just lost your job
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.640]   or you're frustrated because you got passed over
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.200]   for a promotion.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.620]   Maybe your parents are going through a divorce.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.940]   Maybe you're going through a breakup.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.900]   And you would say that you feel like your life
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.880]   is miserable right now in agony.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.740]   Yeah, Jesus has been in that place.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.980]   You know what he did in that moment?
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.160]   He prayed, he prayed.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.700]   Jesus prayed.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.860]   And before Jesus took his last breath
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.440]   as he hung on the cross, what's the last thing he did?
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.420]   Luke 23, verse 46 says,
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.920]   "Then Jesus calling out with a loud voice says,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.940]   'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.'
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.620]   And having said this, he breathed his last."
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.860]   The last words that came out of Jesus's mouth
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:22.100]   before he gave up his life and death was a prayer.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.500]   His ministry started with prayer.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.120]   His ministry culminated in prayer.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.500]   Jesus prayed.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.380]   If you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.780]   you should pray because Jesus prayed.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.620]   Martin Luther put it this way.
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.780]   I've shared this quote every night of the series.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.100]   He said, "To be a Christian without prayer
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.100]   is no more possible than to be alive without breathing."
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.340]   Like it just doesn't, it doesn't make sense.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.200]   So why should you pray?
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.980]   If you're a Christian, one of the reasons you should pray
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.220]   is because Jesus prayed and we want to be like Jesus.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.100]   The second reason you should pray
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.680]   is because prayer is how we get more of God.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.460]   Like it's the doorway to greater intimacy with God.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.180]   If I were to sit down with you at coffee
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.220]   and I were to just say,
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.220]   "Are you content with your relationship with God?"
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.100]   Like if there was more love from God to experience,
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.460]   would you want it?
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.660]   Would you want to experience greater amounts of grace?
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.660]   Would you like to see God's power in an even clearer way?
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.500]   Would you like to experience His nearness
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.900]   in an even more personal way?
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.340]   I think a good majority of people in here would say,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:42.340]   "Of course prayer is the way to get more of God."
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:49.500]   Listen to what Jesus says
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.460]   right before he gives the Lord's prayer.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.900]   This is so important.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.240]   He says this in Matthew chapter six, verse five.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.380]   He says, "And when you pray," notice the wording.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.260]   He says, "When you pray, not if you pray."
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.420]   Jesus assumes that we will pray.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.580]   If you're a Christian,
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.660]   if you're a follower of Jesus Christ, you should pray.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.380]   He says, "When you pray,
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.460]   "you must not be like the hypocrites."
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.980]   That word in the Greek, in old Greek,
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.980]   it used to refer to an actor
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.600]   who would wear a mask while performing.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.140]   But when Jesus uses the word hypocrite,
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.480]   he's talking about people who view the world as their stage
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.440]   that they perform on to win people's approval and applause.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.700]   He says, "Don't be like those people.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.300]   "They love to stand and pray in the synagogues
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.580]   "and at the street corners,
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.720]   "which were both high traffic areas
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.760]   "where a lot of people would see them."
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.580]   And he said, "They do that," why?
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.660]   "So that they may be seen by others."
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.320]   Truly, I say to you, they've received their reward.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.480]   What's his point?
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.240]   His point is like, prayer doesn't exist
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.360]   for you to win other people's approval.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.820]   Don't let your best prayers be done in public.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.460]   Is it wrong to pray in public?
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.240]   Absolutely not.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.720]   We've prayed tonight in public.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.880]   That's not what this is about.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.840]   But Jesus goes on, he says, "When you pray,
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.060]   "go into your room and shut the door
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.200]   "and pray to your Father who is in secret."
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.040]   Jesus is basically saying, do what I did.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   Jesus would minister to the crowds
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.120]   and then what would he do?
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.000]   He would withdraw to be with his Father.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.240]   He's saying, do the same thing.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.660]   Like, be around people.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:34.220]   But then get alone with your Father who sees in secret.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.680]   You wanna be seen by God the Father.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.880]   And listen to what he says.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.600]   He says, "And your Father who sees in secret
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.160]   "will reward you."
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.200]   Did you hear that?
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.600]   There is actually a reward for praying.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.160]   God will reward people who pray.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.840]   Well, what's the reward?
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.480]   It's a good question to ask.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.140]   I'd like to know what the reward is
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.760]   to know if it's worth doing it.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.600]   What's the reward?
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.060]   God will give you more of himself.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.680]   It's the kindest thing God could do
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.560]   to any person in this room right now
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.020]   is give you more of himself.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.880]   Here's what I want you to understand
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.080]   and I hope you don't miss this.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.980]   So if you're tuned out, come back.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.820]   Come back.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.860]   God wants to give you more of himself.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.740]   He delights to give you more of himself.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.600]   But God might wait to give you more of himself
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.340]   until you are willing to withdraw to be with him.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.460]   Why?
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.420]   Because he loves you.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.620]   Some of us are frustrated and we feel spiritually dry.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.780]   We feel disconnected with God.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.860]   We feel bored with God.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.700]   Why?
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.060]   Because we want to connect.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.740]   We try and connect with God
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.060]   while we're connecting with the rest of the world.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.100]   So we're driving to work and while we're driving,
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.900]   we're also texting or checking Instagram.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.080]   It's like, okay, well, God,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.620]   I'm going to listen to the Bible app
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.400]   and I trust that you're going to speak to me
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.940]   while all these other people are also speaking to me
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.300]   and I'm also driving
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.580]   and I've got these two to three minutes,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.380]   but God didn't show up.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.100]   So I don't know why God's not showing up
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.700]   because I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.940]   I listen to the Bible app while I'm driving
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.460]   and checking Instagram and texting
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.100]   and I don't know what God's problem is,
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.860]   but I just feel dry and disconnected.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.460]   And I wonder if God's like, I love you too much
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.920]   to give you all of myself when you're not ready to listen.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:39.380]   And so God in his kindness might wait
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.680]   for you to withdraw,
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.140]   for him to give you more of himself.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.140]   Prayer is how we get more of God.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.580]   That's why you should pray.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.420]   Why should you pray?
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.860]   Because Jesus prayed and because prayer
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.220]   is how you get more of God.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.120]   So let's answer the second question.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.100]   How should I pray?
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.220]   How should I pray?
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.340]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:09.180]   I want to just walk you through
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.340]   seven different ways that you can pray.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.820]   I'm gonna get very practical.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.500]   I don't want anyone leaving here tonight saying,
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.020]   that's great that I should pray,
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.300]   but I have no clue how to pray.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.300]   Okay, this is me being John saying,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.960]   okay, you're gonna hold the racket.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.020]   You're gonna do this.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.540]   You're gonna do this.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.220]   This is what you do.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.220]   Let me just walk you through seven different practices.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.760]   And the reason I call them practices
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.580]   is because they take practice.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.420]   And I'm not inviting you to do all seven,
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.760]   just inviting you to take a step, like to try one.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.900]   So here they are.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.540]   Number one, one way that you can pray
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.320]   is by using the Lord's Prayer as a framework.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.900]   Many of you already have it memorized.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.020]   I'm not just talking about repeating the Lord's Prayer.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.460]   I'm talking about using it as a framework.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.380]   So I wrote a prayer.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.700]   I'll put it on the screen.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.320]   It could look like this.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.100]   Our Father in heaven, God, thank you
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.540]   that you are my Father, which makes me your child.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.780]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died for my sins
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.380]   and rose from the dead to bring me into the family of God.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.460]   And you are my Father in heaven,
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.120]   meaning you're a perfect Father.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.380]   Hallowed be your name.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.300]   God, you are holy, holy, holy.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.380]   There's no one like you.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.380]   Your kingdom come, your will be done.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.940]   God, would you rule and reign in my life today?
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.180]   You're in charge.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.780]   Your way is the best way.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.260]   You lead and I will follow,
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.280]   and you can just work your way through the Lord's Prayer.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.620]   Use it as a framework.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:51.940]   Second prayer practice is to just use the AX acronym.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:56.220]   AX.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.980]   The A stands for adoration.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.960]   It's just the idea of praising God for who he is.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.940]   God praise you that you are good.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.180]   God praise you that you are sovereign.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.780]   You are in control today and every day.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.520]   The C stands for confession.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.860]   Confession is just you acknowledging before God
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.720]   the ways that you have resisted his ways.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.460]   God, I just wanna confess, I wanna ask your forgiveness
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.740]   that I continually escape to fantasy worlds,
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.800]   which I know is not honoring and pleasing to you.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.600]   Would you forgive me for that?
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.140]   God, I just wanna confess
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.520]   that I've been leading different girls on.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.200]   I've been leading different guys on.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.760]   Why, to deal with some of the insecurities in my heart
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.260]   that only you can deal with.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.680]   Would you forgive me for that, Lord God?
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.160]   God, I just wanna ask your forgiveness.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.280]   I've just been cashing it in at work.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.480]   I have been barely working.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.160]   I've just been doing enough to get by
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.760]   instead of working in a way
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.220]   that would be honoring and pleasing to you.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.500]   Would you forgive me for that?
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.100]   That's the C, confession.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.860]   The T stands for thanksgiving.
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.600]   God, thank you for a great workout this morning.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.280]   God, thank you that I had a great lunch
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.520]   with that person that I ate with.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.440]   God, thank you for your grace in my life,
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.620]   that your mercies are new every morning,
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.560]   that you still haven't given up on me.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.040]   The S stands for supplication.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.880]   It is just the idea of asking God to move.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.080]   God, would you give me an opportunity today
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.520]   to share the gospel with a coworker?
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.280]   God, give me the courage to invite someone to the porch.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.920]   God, I pray that today you would bring healing
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.360]   in my parents' marriage.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.920]   I just wanna believe, God, that even when it's over,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.480]   it's not over, and you can heal and restore.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.280]   Would you move, God?
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.020]   And you don't have to pray 'em all in order,
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.800]   and you don't have to pray all four all at once.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.760]   You can just pray.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.520]   You can just have a time of adoration
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.020]   when you're driving to work in the morning,
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.560]   or time of confession,
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.560]   but use the acronym to kind of direct you on the right path.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.720]   The third practice is to pray scripture.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.940]   This is the most common thing that I do
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.160]   on most days of the week,
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.760]   is that when I talk about praying scripture,
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.360]   all I'm talking about doing is reading scripture
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.600]   and turning it into prayers.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.840]   Let's do it together right now.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.140]   If you have a Bible, open up to Psalm 34.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.200]   So this is what I do most days of the week,
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.980]   is I will read something, I will see what sticks out to me,
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.560]   and then I will take those verses
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.880]   and I will turn 'em into prayers.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.720]   Psalm 34 is a passage that I spend almost a month in.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.400]   I just read the same chapter every day,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.840]   and then I would journal and pray through one verse,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.880]   but it could look like this.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.320]   Psalm 34, verse one says,
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.240]   "I will bless the Lord at all times.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.760]   "His praise shall continually be in my mouth."
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.200]   God, today has been a very tough day,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.860]   and yet I will choose to bless you at all times.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.120]   Your praise, I want your praise to be on my mouth today.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.920]   Even on the toughest days, you are still good,
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.380]   you are still worthy of praise.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.640]   So I just say, bless you, God.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.880]   Bless your holy name.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.680]   My soul makes its boast in the Lord.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.760]   That's verse two.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.240]   God, I don't want my hope in life to be in my abilities.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.720]   I don't want it to be in my circumstances.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.760]   God, I boast in you that you are sovereign,
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   that you are in control, that your ways are good,
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.800]   that you have my best in mind,
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.460]   that your will for my life is good, pleasing, and perfect,
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.680]   so I make you my boast.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.040]   Skip down to verse four.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.700]   David says, "I sought the Lord, and he answered me
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.360]   "and delivered me from all my fears."
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.300]   God, today I'm dealing with fear.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.760]   Like, I don't know what's going on with my son today.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.040]   I don't know how things are gonna go there.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.760]   God, I'm dealing with some fear about some various things
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.240]   that are happening at work, but you hear me,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.360]   and I'm gonna seek you,
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.840]   and I'm gonna trust that you hear me,
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.040]   and you are going to respond in your timing
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.920]   and in your own perfect way.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.560]   Verse five.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   Those who look to him, to God, are radiant.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.720]   God, I feel down today.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.900]   I feel down.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.320]   I feel like I'm trending towards anxiety and depression,
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.960]   and yet your word says that when I look to you,
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.880]   you can make me radiant.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.000]   I can tell that my countenance shows the world
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.560]   that I am weighed down, that my life feels heavy.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.620]   People are even asking me, "Hey, dude, are you okay?"
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.020]   So God, I look to you.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.360]   I put my trust in you.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.120]   You are my hope today.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.760]   Would you transform my countenance?
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.360]   May I be radiant.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.260]   To the world.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.620]   May my, would you relieve me from the weight that I bear?
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.860]   I trust you.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.940]   See, that's what it looks like.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.900]   You just, you pray the scripture.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.220]   You take scripture and you turn it into prayers.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.940]   This is one of the best ways to live in God's will.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.460]   So many young adults are like,
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.260]   I don't know, what's God's will for my life?
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.460]   Well, this'll tell you 98% of God's will for your life.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.300]   Just read it and pray it, and you will be in God's will.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.780]   Like, if you wanna pray God's will,
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.920]   read this and turn it into prayers.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.460]   If you wanna see God answer prayers, pray the scriptures.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.740]   Why can I say that with confidence?
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.860]   Well, Jesus says, "If you abide in me,
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.180]   "and my words abide in you,
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.320]   "ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.500]   Notice Jesus didn't just say,
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.580]   "Ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.240]   That's a genie.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.180]   That's not Jesus, that's a genie.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.320]   Jesus says, "If you abide in me,
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.480]   "and my words abide in you,
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.260]   "ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.440]   'Cause when you pray these words,
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.280]   you know what you're doing?
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.360]   You are praying God's heart.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.260]   He loves to answer prayers that are aligned with his heart.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:17.020]   The fourth practice is, some of y'all are familiar with,
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:22.020]   it's called Lectio Divina, which means divine reading.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.100]   So if the third prayer practice,
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.000]   which was praying scripture,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.800]   the difference between the third practice
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.480]   and the fourth practice is this.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   The third practice is about talking to God about scripture,
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.100]   and the fourth practice is about
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.300]   God talking to you about scripture.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.440]   Do you see the difference?
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.680]   One is about you talking to God about scripture,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.500]   and the other is God talking to you about scripture.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.280]   And I love this practice,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.840]   and it looks different for different people,
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.240]   but here's what I'm really talking about.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.300]   I'm talking about reading a passage of scripture,
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.300]   and then just choosing one verse, or less than one verse.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.920]   Like you take one verse, and what you do
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.720]   is you just set a timer for maybe two minutes,
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.780]   and just sit quietly.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.840]   You're not praying, you are just sitting quietly,
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.720]   focusing on the presence of God, that God is with you,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.220]   and he wants to speak to you.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.440]   And then after that timer goes off,
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.440]   what you do is you take that verse,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.800]   and you read that one verse a few times.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.840]   And then after you read that verse a few times,
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   maybe you write down what is kind of hitting your heart,
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.780]   what's speaking to you,
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.520]   what it seems like God is speaking to you,
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.180]   just as you read it, and you write stuff down.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.940]   And then what you do is you can set another timer
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.700]   for two, three, four, five minutes,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.660]   and you just sit, and you ask God to speak to you,
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.300]   and just say, "God, what do you want to tell me
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.460]   "about this verse?"
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.960]   And just let him speak to you.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.060]   We did this as a family.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.140]   Like my wife and I hopped on Zoom
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.900]   with all of my wife's family.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.700]   Like she's got three other siblings,
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.660]   and their spouses, my in-laws.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.500]   Like we all got on Zoom together,
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.300]   and we did this practice together.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.020]   So we took Proverbs 3, 5, and 6,
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.720]   which says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.920]   "Do not lean on your own understanding,
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.640]   "and all of your ways acknowledge him,
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.020]   "and he will make your paths straight."
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.640]   So here's what we did together.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.100]   You can do this with your roommates.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.900]   You can do this with people in other states.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.880]   We set a timer for two minutes,
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.560]   and we just said, "We're just gonna sit quietly,
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.640]   "and just focus on God's presence."
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.240]   We want our worlds, everything we're stressed about,
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.400]   to kind of fade away.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.080]   We're just gonna focus on God being here with us.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.520]   After that timer went off, we said,
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.520]   "Okay, we're gonna take the first phrase,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.360]   "trust in the Lord with all your heart."
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.080]   Okay, two minutes.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.400]   Just sit with the Lord.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.960]   Ask him, "God, what do you wanna say to me
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.760]   "about trusting in you with all of my heart?"
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.400]   We did that for two minutes.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.120]   If something came to mind, we'd write it down.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:12.960]   Timer went off.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.160]   We set another timer.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.200]   Do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.800]   Okay, God, what do you wanna say to me
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.940]   about not leaning on my own understanding?
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.040]   So we'd just sit quietly for two minutes.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.880]   Timer went off.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.360]   Okay, God, speak to me.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.240]   What do you want me to know
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.600]   about acknowledging you in all my ways?
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.720]   Timer went off.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.880]   Two more minutes.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.220]   And he will make your path straight.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.060]   God, speak to me.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.300]   And so we did that through Proverbs 3, 5, and 6,
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.520]   and then we just opened it up,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.360]   and we just began to share
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.960]   what the Lord spoke to us through his word.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.000]   And it was really powerful,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.320]   and it was really encouraging.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.760]   Okay, the fifth prayer practice,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.960]   it's a great one to do on your drive home from work,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.360]   or when you get into bed at night,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.400]   and just you're kinda powering down for the day.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.040]   It's called the examine prayer.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.680]   And there's different ways to do this,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.360]   but the way that I really like it has a few steps,
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.720]   and here are the steps.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.880]   Okay, the first step is that you just sit.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.580]   You just sit for two, three minutes.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.400]   You set a timer.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.320]   For two to three minutes, you just sit quietly.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.140]   You're not praying.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.220]   You're just focusing on the presence of God.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.840]   And then what you do is you walk through your day with God,
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.840]   and you just ask God to reveal to you
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.460]   all the things that you should be thankful for.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.860]   So anything that God deserves credit for,
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.960]   you should thank him for it.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.760]   So God, thank you that it was 75 degrees
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.120]   this morning on my run.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.820]   It will not be that way, like, tomorrow.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.660]   God, thank you that I had a great breakfast meeting today.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.600]   Thank you that this meeting at work went a lot better
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.780]   than I thought it was gonna go.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.900]   You walk through your day, and you just express gratitude
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.300]   for all the things that God deserves credit for.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.060]   Then, this is key.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:07.460]   You ask God to reveal to you key moments from your day.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.660]   I heard another pastor describe it
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.360]   as kind of like the light bulb moments,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.720]   like if there was a power surge to a light bulb,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.760]   kind of that, you know, where it just kind of lights up.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   Like, what is the one or two moments of the day?
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.760]   Maybe it was just, maybe it was a moment
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.800]   where you experienced this sudden blast of joy or happiness.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   Maybe it was an overwhelming sense of temptation or lust,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.780]   or where you gave in to sin.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.560]   You ask God to reveal whatever those light bulb moments
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.680]   are to you, and then this is the secret sauce.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.640]   You ask Jesus, did you ever experience this?
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.020]   Or Jesus, what do you want to say to me about this?
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.720]   Let me give you an example from my own life
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.560]   of how this worked.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.760]   This is my favorite experience I've had
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.160]   with the exam and prayer, okay?
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.920]   I've got three boys, I've talked about them a lot,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.840]   and when we lived in College Station,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.240]   my oldest son went through this season
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   where he tried to scare me every single day without fail.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   Like, truly, every night he would go lurking somewhere
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.800]   and he would jump out and try and scare me.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   So I was home alone one day and I heard the garage door open
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.760]   which meant that Kat and my three boys were coming home.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.160]   I was like, okay, well this is my chance
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.640]   to scare my oldest child.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.680]   And so I'm a really great dad.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.680]   Anyway, I went, if you are in the place
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.440]   where the door to the garage is,
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   if you were to walk forward 10 feet, there was a wall.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.000]   And so I hid right behind the wall.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.060]   And unfortunately, my oldest came in and went left.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.160]   But I was still committed.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.000]   So my middle child, he came in right as he walked past me.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.840]   I was like, ah!
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.360]   And it was amazing.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.240]   Because instead of getting freaked out,
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   my 11-year-old just like melted on the ground laughing.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:12.680]   Like he literally, he fell over laughing.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.360]   And here's why that was so important.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.360]   It's because this child has an uphill battle in life
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.560]   and he takes different medication
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.320]   which can sometimes not make him feel good.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.160]   His life can feel really heavy.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.120]   It can be sedating even.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.240]   And when he was collapsing on the ground
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.480]   with his face just lit up,
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.840]   it's not something that I see from him very often.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.200]   And I saw just this lightness
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.520]   and this freedom in his countenance.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.160]   And I couldn't get over it because I saw joy in him.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.880]   So I went to Jesus and I said,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.800]   Jesus, have you ever experienced this?
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.160]   And I felt like Jesus was saying,
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.240]   that's what I experience anytime I healed someone.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.880]   Like when I made the paralyzed walk
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.360]   or the blind man see or the deaf hear,
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.480]   the joy that they experienced,
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.360]   the freedom that they experienced,
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.240]   Jesus, I felt like my heart was connecting to Jesus
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.080]   in that moment.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.440]   It was like, yes, he gets me.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.320]   And the experience he gave me with my son in that moment,
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.720]   it was Jesus drawing me in to greater intimacy with him.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.840]   So try it out.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.800]   And I promise you there will be some sweetness to it.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   The sixth prayer practice
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:36.080]   is what I would just call ask and listen prayer.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.200]   Just ask and listen.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.000]   Good friend and mentor of mine,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.200]   it's a man named, he's a man named Doug Sherman.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.520]   And his whole life has been devoted
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.720]   to helping people around the world
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.120]   experience a conversational relationship with God.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.000]   Where you just converse with God throughout the day.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.600]   Like he takes 1 Thessalonians chapter five,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.040]   verse 16 very seriously.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.480]   When Paul says, "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing."
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.560]   Like pray always.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.400]   And so Doug has been so great about just saying,
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.240]   what would it look like all throughout the day
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.520]   to just ask God questions and then listen for his response
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.400]   in the form of him bringing a verse to mind
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.680]   or maybe giving you an impression on your heart
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.520]   or your mind.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.840]   So just imagine going through your day
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.440]   and asking questions like this.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.040]   Like even just asking one of these questions
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.120]   would take your prayer life to a whole new level.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.080]   Like before you start your car,
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.040]   this is something that Doug said.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.920]   Like before you push the start engine button
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.080]   or you turn the key,
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.400]   what if you just paused and asked God,
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.080]   "Who do you want me to pray for right now?"
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.600]   And just see who he brings to mind.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.960]   And if he brings someone to mind, pray for them.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.640]   Then text them, shoot them a text saying,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.640]   "Hey, I just prayed for you, God brought you to mind."
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   They will be encouraged and you will be encouraged.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.480]   Or what about this?
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.440]   Imagine this on your way home tonight
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.320]   when you were driving home,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.200]   talk to God and say,
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.200]   "God, what are you trying to show me right now?"
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.080]   What if we began to believe that God
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.920]   is always putting his goodness and greatness on display?
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.480]   It's just a question of if we have eyes to see it.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.040]   So just ask him as you're driving,
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.120]   "God, what are you wanting me to see right now?"
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.780]   And just see what he shows you.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.920]   If you wanna transform your meetings during the day,
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.440]   then before you go into any meeting,
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.200]   set a timer to go off five minutes before that meeting
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.340]   where you ask God this question,
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.940]   "God, what attitude do you want me to have right now?"
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:46.080]   Or this, "How do you want me to respond in this situation?"
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   Or, "God, is there anything I need to confess right now?"
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.400]   I used this last week.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.660]   One of my, my oldest son Noah came home
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.800]   and just told me that a kid was bullying him.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.840]   And I talked about it last week when he was younger,
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.160]   but this is now, he's 13, this guy was bullying him.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.120]   And if you wanna see me kind of gear up about something,
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.680]   just come after my kids, all right?
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.840]   And so here's the deal, what I've learned about myself
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:18.080]   is I can snap into like junior high mode
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.600]   when if my son is getting bullied,
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.840]   my automatic reflex is to just come up with comebacks.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.200]   So before my son got braces, this was not last week,
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.080]   but before Noah got braces, he was worried
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.480]   that a kid at school with braces
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.980]   was gonna come after him and be like,
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.560]   "Hey, you don't look good in braces."
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.720]   And so my mind was like, "Here's your comeback.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.200]   If a kid with braces looks at you and says,
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.520]   "You don't look good with braces,"
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.260]   say, "Yeah, we're just two ugly dudes with braces."
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.840]   Like, that's what you tell that guy.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.680]   That'll shut him up.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.280]   Like, that's how my mind works.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.320]   So last week, this kid was bullying my son.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.720]   And so I just started coming up with these comebacks.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.920]   And then I went for a run.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.820]   And as I'm running, I'm like,
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.900]   "God, how would you have me encourage Noah?"
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.960]   And I think the Lord was like, "Not that way."
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.080]   And the Lord in that moment,
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.160]   he just reminded me of what Jesus did
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.320]   when he was being ridiculed.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.440]   And when he was being harassed and mocked,
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.380]   Matthew 26, 63 says, "But Jesus remained silent."
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.420]   And so I went home and I said,
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.040]   "Noah, I gave you really bad advice."
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.400]   And as I was on my run and talking to God about it,
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.800]   I just felt like he wanted me to show you what Jesus did.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.040]   Jesus remained silent.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.800]   That doesn't mean that Noah should remain silent
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.680]   in every situation, but in this particular situation,
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.640]   the best thing to do was to suck the oxygen out of the room
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.440]   for the guy who was bullying him.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.120]   Just remain silent.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.800]   And it was God's kindness that he spoke to me
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.080]   through that kind of ask and listen prayer method.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.800]   And then the final, the final prayer practice
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.480]   is what's called chair time, which is a book that I read.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.680]   I'm not necessarily encouraging you to go to read it.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.960]   It's 35 pages long,
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.200]   so I'm just gonna summarize it for you in 15 seconds.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.520]   Chair time is just the idea of, you just find a chair
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.580]   and you sit in that chair every day for 30 days,
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:25.520]   for 15 minutes, and you just listen.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.920]   You're not praying, you're just sitting
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.800]   and giving God the space to speak.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.960]   And so I did that.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.960]   Summer of 21, just decided for 30 days,
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.280]   I'm gonna sit for 15 minutes and just listen.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.760]   And in a lot of ways, it transformed my life
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.640]   because God began to speak
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.720]   and he would bring his word to mind.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.080]   He would bring people to mind
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.240]   that he wanted me to pray for.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.720]   He would show me what he wanted me to do in ministry.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.280]   But one of the most powerful things
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.660]   that I learned during that time
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.160]   is one day I was sitting for 15 minutes
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.520]   and when I got to about the 14 minute and 30 second mark,
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.600]   I hadn't gotten anything from the Lord.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.480]   And then it was like the Lord chimed in and was like,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.520]   "Hey, why do you need me to say anything?
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.680]   "Why can't we just sit here and enjoy one another?"
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.600]   And what God was doing is he was reminding me
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.040]   that I have this insecurity
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   about being with someone and no one talking.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.320]   Like I get super awkward.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.100]   That's why I don't like to ride in the car
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.360]   with people to lunch because I'm like,
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.980]   "What if we don't have anything to talk about?
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.320]   "So I'll just meet you there."
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.020]   Like my wife, when we go on a date night,
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.320]   I bring conversation cards that I bought online
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.680]   because I'm like, "We're not gonna run out of conversation."
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.780]   And you're like, "Man, you sound like a lot of fun
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.000]   "to be married to."
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.560]   And I think God was like, "Why do you need that?"
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.340]   Like the people that you love the most,
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.100]   you should just be able to enjoy them.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.280]   Just enjoy being with them.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   And he brought to mind Psalm 1611,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.220]   which says, "In your presence, there's fullness of joy."
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.840]   It doesn't say, "In my presence when I'm talking to you."
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.520]   It just says, "In my presence, there's fullness of joy."
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.840]   So I would just say this.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.400]   If at any time you're praying and there's no joy in it,
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.480]   I don't know that God's in it
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.000]   because in his presence, there's fullness of joy.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.200]   There's seven prayer practices.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.160]   And you might be like, "Man, that's overwhelming."
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.520]   I'm not telling you to go do all seven.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.360]   I'm just saying, just take a step.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.480]   And then let me just give you a few things
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.140]   to experiment with.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.720]   I'm just gonna throw some things out to you.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.400]   Again, I want you to leave knowing exactly what you can do.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.240]   Like try this.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.360]   I remember one time I was driving
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.680]   from Wichita Falls to Dallas.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.920]   It's about two hours.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.080]   And I just said, "I'm gonna try and pray the whole time."
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.520]   That was a big lift for me to try and do that.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.440]   But I was so surprised at how God just continued
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.320]   to give me fuel for the fire of prayer.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.120]   It was really encouraging and enjoyable.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.720]   If you've been praying a lot in life,
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.160]   then try and pray for a whole half day.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.240]   Just spend the whole morning in prayer with God.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.920]   Try going for prayer walks.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.720]   Like this is something that has brought me a lot of joy,
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.280]   to just go for walks, long walks,
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.600]   and just walk and talk with God.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.440]   Try praying on your knees.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.620]   Try praying out loud.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.120]   Try journaling your prayers.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.120]   Let me just show you something real quick.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.480]   I've been experimenting with journaling.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.240]   And so something recently I did was I downloaded
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.920]   an app called Day One.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:33.280]   And so what I have on the side
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   is I have all these different categories of people
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   that I wanna pray for.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.300]   So there's my kids, there's my wife,
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.040]   there's praying for the porch,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.520]   praying for watermark, personal prayer.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.260]   Clearly I pray for myself a lot more than anyone else.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.860]   So that's problematic and needs to be addressed.
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.000]   I got my listening prayer,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.440]   when I just sit and listen to God,
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.080]   things I'm grateful for.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.720]   But like one of my sons,
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.360]   he just needs a lot of prayer right now.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.400]   So I'll just show you this.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.720]   Like I will sit in his room at night
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.700]   and I'll journal prayers.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.600]   And then the cool thing is I can take a picture
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.540]   of me praying.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.920]   That isn't creepy.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.960]   At all.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:24.640]   But the reason that I love that app,
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:35.800]   the reason I love that app is that like next year,
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.700]   and I'm just a couple months into using this app,
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.740]   but next year, like it will show me
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.000]   what I was praying on this day last year.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.240]   So I can just see like,
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.120]   what was I praying for a year ago?
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.520]   And in two years, I'll be able to say,
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.760]   what was I praying for two years ago?
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.220]   And it'll just be fun to see.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.160]   Pray for different things on different days.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.040]   You don't have to pray for everything on every day.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.600]   So just know all those categories.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.320]   I don't pray for all of them every day.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.340]   Sometimes I don't pray for any of them on a day.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.140]   Sometimes I pray for one of them.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.380]   Sometimes I pray for four of them.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.600]   Just depends.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.720]   Fast and pray.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.920]   Fast from food and pray.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.160]   That might bring urgency to your prayers.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.960]   Fast from social media and pray.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.520]   If you're like, I don't have any time to pray,
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.520]   do you have time to look at social media?
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.480]   Too convicting, let's go.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.400]   One thing I've done is I've set an alarm
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.600]   to remind me to pray.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   So set an alarm on your watch to go off every 30 minutes.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.740]   When it goes off, just stop.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.920]   If you're able to, get on your knees and say a quick prayer.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.040]   Get a prayer board.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.440]   Like we got a dry erase board
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.900]   when we were in College Station.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.620]   Everyone in our family wanted to use the same shower,
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.560]   not at the same time,
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.120]   but we all used the same shower at different times.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.120]   I don't know why I said that, but anyway.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.600]   The shower had a glass wall to it,
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.920]   and so I put a dry erase board
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.600]   just right outside that glass wall
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.920]   'cause the shower's a good time to pray,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.140]   and people in the family could look at
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.640]   what they can be praying for.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.960]   And then a friend of mine, Greg Mott,
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.640]   he put a sleeping bag in front of his closet
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.800]   when he was in college,
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.200]   and I know you're not in college,
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.000]   but one thing you could do is put a sleeping bag
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.640]   in front of your closet because what Greg said is,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.440]   I'm either gonna step over God to start my day,
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.480]   or I'm gonna kneel down with God to start my day.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.720]   And so before he would get dressed,
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.400]   he would just kneel down to be with the Lord.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.520]   And he made a rule, before I eat physically,
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.460]   I'm gonna eat spiritually.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.360]   So it just might be something to try.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.320]   All I'm encouraging you to do is to take a step.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.360]   I'll just finish by saying this.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   There's an invitation on the table
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.800]   for everyone in the room tonight.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.560]   It's an invitation to intimacy.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.080]   It's an invitation to intimacy.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.680]   So if you're here tonight,
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.840]   and you don't have a relationship with God,
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.500]   you need to understand that the reason
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.200]   that Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth,
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.720]   the reason that he went to a cross,
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.920]   was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead,
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.360]   the reason he did that was to bring us
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.480]   into a right, real, enjoyable,
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.800]   and intimate relationship with God.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.520]   That's on the table for you tonight.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.400]   If you don't know Jesus,
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.520]   if you want a real relationship with God,
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.640]   if you want an enjoyable and intimate relationship with God,
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   it only comes through knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.520]   Maybe your first prayer tonight is,
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.660]   Jesus, I believe in you.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.380]   I give my life to you.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.420]   And then if you already know Jesus,
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.040]   would you just believe that it's not about
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.140]   God wanting something from you,
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.020]   it's really about God wanting something with you.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.780]   He doesn't want more from you
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.020]   as much as he wants more with you.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:52.660]   And prayer is how we get more of God.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.540]   Let's pray together.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:00.880]   Lord Jesus, I pray,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.060]   and I thank you that you have come,
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.180]   that you have died, that you have risen,
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.220]   and you did all of that to bring us
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:14.100]   into relationship with God so that we can pray,
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.980]   so we can talk to you, and you'll hear us,
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:20.960]   and we can hear from you as we study your word,
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.820]   and we pray.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.340]   Lord, my hope and prayer for every young adult
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.760]   in the room tonight is that they would just take a step,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.000]   that they wouldn't leave here feeling overwhelmed.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.220]   But even if it's just leaving
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:37.460]   just with one thing that they might try,
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.700]   I pray that there would be more joy
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.780]   that is experienced by the people in this room this week
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.740]   because of what you're doing in our hearts tonight.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.820]   We need you, and we love you.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:50.260]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:54:00.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
