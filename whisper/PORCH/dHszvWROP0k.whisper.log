[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:20.640]   - Good evening, Dallas.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.560]   Hello, everyone.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.400]   My name is Garrett.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.220]   If we've never met before,
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.520]   if we've never spent time together before,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.080]   I wanna welcome everybody who's tuning in,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.100]   not in this exact room,
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.880]   whether you're in Fort Worth or Houston
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.400]   or somewhere else in all the creation.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.440]   So glad you guys are gonna be a part of this tonight.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.980]   Hey, I wanna start by asking you this question.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.120]   Have you ever had a moment in life
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.480]   that seemed to throw you into a little bit of a pit?
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.160]   I'm not talking about a mere problem.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.280]   I'm talking about a problem that you get stuck in
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.960]   and you can't seem to climb your way out of.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.840]   Like it graduates from a problem to an all out pit.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.720]   You ever had that moment?
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.800]   Let me tell you about the first one I had
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.060]   when I came on staff.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.640]   So I became a resident here in the fall of 2013.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.960]   So almost five years ago.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.720]   And as soon as I became a resident,
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.200]   just a few weeks later was the biggest
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.280]   porch event of the year.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.160]   It's called Launch-A-Treat.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.280]   I'm not sure if any of you have heard of it
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.000]   or enjoyed a good time out there.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.720]   But the first event of me being a resident
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960]   was that we were gonna go have a Launch-A-Treat.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   Now keep in mind, think like first day on the job,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.000]   first few weeks on the job,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   you really wanna do right.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.160]   You don't wanna mess anything up.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.000]   You know, you don't want anybody
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520]   to think you're not pulling your weight.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.460]   That's kind of the mentality.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.000]   Make a good first impression.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.940]   That's kind of the mentality
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.960]   that I'm coming into this event with.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.940]   And David approached me
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.800]   and we did not know each other well at this point.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.920]   And he just said, "Hey, you have one job.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.120]   "In this opening session, you are the balloon drop guy."
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.800]   And I like looked up in the room.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.280]   And in this room,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.360]   where there were gonna be 1,000 young adults,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.660]   many of you seated right there in that room,
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.120]   there's this huge net of balloons,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.120]   a tube of balloons going across the room from left to right.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.320]   And he says, "Hey, at the end of the national anthem,"
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.520]   'cause there's like a game day theme,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.100]   and so there's gonna be a national anthem go off
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.360]   and confetti and all this stuff.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720]   He said, "At the end of the national anthem, okay,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.920]   "like somewhere around, you know,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.560]   "or the land of the brave, you know, or land of the free."
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.200]   Sorry, I'm an American, I love this country.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.120]   But anyway, so anyway, he's like,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.880]   "Hey, at that part, I want you to start pulling."
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.280]   You can see why he wasn't confident.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.720]   So anyway, he starts, he tells me,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.160]   "Hey, you just start pulling that rope."
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.180]   Because what happened was the tube was held together
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.780]   by a rope that went over the sidewall
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.920]   and then back in the back corner.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.720]   So I'm in like the back left corner of the room
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   and I'm just waiting.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.640]   And there are people that are screaming
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.920]   and hollering, "Launch your treats here.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.740]   "It's Labor Day weekend, three-day weekend,
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.000]   "about to have a great time."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.480]   And everything has gone off perfectly, it's amazing.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.100]   And then it is time for the balloon drop.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.260]   So I start to pull right at the ending moment.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.440]   I mean, everybody's standing up.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   I mean, it's just an epic start to the weekend.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.560]   And I start to pull and all of a sudden,
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.400]   instead of the rope kind of like loosening out
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.320]   from under the net, and in theory, that's what would happen.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   And then the balloons would fall
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.600]   and the people would cheer and I would feel good inside.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.360]   In theory, that's what was gonna happen.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   But instead of the rope kind of unwinding,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.840]   as I could see it from the back corner of the room,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.440]   all of a sudden on the far right side
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.000]   of this big, huge balloon tube,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.380]   it's like kind of bunching up
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.280]   and kind of contorting a little bit.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.840]   I'm like, "I don't think it's supposed to be like that."
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.680]   And I start to pull and it gets a little harder
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.880]   and it starts to kind of contort more.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.920]   And all of a sudden there's more tension in the rope.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.240]   And I'm like, "I don't think this is right."
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.040]   And at this point, it's decision time.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.200]   'Cause I'm thinking, "Okay, what if the balloons don't fall
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.480]   "because the new guy didn't pull hard enough?"
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.640]   That is not going to happen.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.840]   So I pulled a little more and there was this loud pop
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.960]   and the entire tube of balloons,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.000]   it was held to the ceiling
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.760]   and the entire right half of the tube of balloons
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.080]   starts to fall toward the ground.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.760]   People literally scream like a building's falling down.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.640]   And so people look up and they're terrified.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   And this balloon tube, it's like, it's just balloons,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.480]   it's not gonna hurt you people.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   But I mean, people yell audibly,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.420]   it's a room and a crowd,
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.280]   people don't know what that pop sound is.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.640]   And so they look up and this balloon thing
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.260]   is kind of floating down.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260]   And then it stops in a very unfortunate position.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.040]   Some would say an anatomical position.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:05.280]   I wish I could tell you that man you see in that photograph.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.480]   Oh, let's let it have its moment.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.920]   Go ahead and put it back up there.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.560]   I wish that I could say that man's back
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.360]   that you see with someone else, but that is yours truly.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.960]   And that's after it all calmed down, okay?
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.360]   And by the way, just so you know,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.080]   it wasn't like three or four people
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.080]   in the corner of the room were like,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.760]   you know, if you tilt your head just right,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.040]   it kind of looks phallic.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.560]   It was like 1000 people looked up and were like,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.260]   oh, it's a balloon penis, clearly.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   Obviously.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.240]   It was one of the worst moments of my life.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.320]   Some of you, it's your first time,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.200]   and you're like, this is what happened to church
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.840]   while I was gone.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.480]   Crazy.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   So, oh, wait, let me do my David laugh.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.720]   (laughing)
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.760]   So I had this moment.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.240]   I heard David picked on me a few weeks ago.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.480]   I had to come back and get him.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.240]   So I had this moment and all of a sudden,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.840]   so first off, that moment itself is a pit, okay?
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.800]   So that moment itself is like, everybody knows.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   I mean, all you have to do is look back.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.840]   There's a guy in the back left corner.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   He's clear with the balloon drop problem.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.440]   And so, but then after that,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.120]   I stayed in a pit of embarrassment for a long time.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.680]   The entire retreat, I was walking around
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   just with embarrassment, just like covering me.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.760]   I mean, can you imagine?
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.400]   Every time I ran into somebody, I was like,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.640]   I'm trying to meet new people.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.920]   You know, like I'm new here.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.760]   I'm new to town.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.640]   I'm new to the team.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.800]   And I'm trying to meet people.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.120]   And I'm just completely just underwater
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.760]   with this idea that I am the problem here.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.800]   And it was just so embarrassing.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.400]   So the embarrassment was like a pit to me.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.680]   I mean, I was stuck in it.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.600]   I couldn't climb my way out.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.480]   I tried to tell myself like, oh, you know,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.320]   mistakes happen.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.640]   And you know, if the apostle Paul himself
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.880]   had been pulling the rope, that would have happened.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.120]   I mean, it's clearly a predestined problem.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.440]   So I'm trying to make myself feel better,
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.320]   but I'm stuck in this pit of embarrassment.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.280]   And I can't get out.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.880]   At first it was a problem,
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.840]   but then it graduated to an all out pit.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.800]   I mean, I was embarrassed for weeks.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.440]   When I was meeting new people on staff,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.040]   I was afraid it would become staff legend.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.200]   And those fears have come true, by the way.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.760]   But it just, it stuck with me.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.680]   And I couldn't figure out the mental game of like,
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.080]   how do I not be ashamed of this?
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.960]   And that sounds really silly, but I know this.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   Life can throw you into a pit
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.920]   a lot more violently than that, can it?
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.520]   Only this time, there's no funny story.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.360]   It's just hard.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.680]   And when I say the word pit tonight,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.680]   I want you to know exactly what I mean by that.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.280]   When I say that word, what I'm talking about
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.200]   is I'm talking about something
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.840]   that could be emotional or actual.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.480]   By an emotional pit, what I mean is,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.200]   I mean an emotional problem
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.600]   that you can't exactly solve yourself,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.160]   like depression or anxiety or sadness.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.200]   When I say an actual pit, what I'm talking about is,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.440]   I'm talking about a situation that's really real
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.480]   and it's really wrong,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.040]   and you really can't get out of it, like probation.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.320]   Like you just got broken up with.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.000]   Like there was a divorce and it continues to affect you.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.560]   Like there was a DUI back there,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.440]   and yeah, that moment itself was a pit,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.320]   and that was an actual physical situation you were in,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.160]   but on top of that,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.960]   you've got the emotional after effects of that situation.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.480]   Sometimes we can dig a pit for ourselves.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.880]   Like if you lie and cheat and get caught,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.800]   and then you're in a drama-filled relationship,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   you dug that pit, that's one you dug for yourself.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.000]   Sometimes other people can dig one for you
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.080]   and just throw you in.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.120]   That's like when you walk into work one day
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.600]   and somebody says, "You don't work here anymore."
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.880]   Life just throws you in it.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.680]   And then sometimes pits can just happen
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.920]   because we live on earth,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.200]   and that is to say a pit-filled world.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.240]   And you didn't do anything,
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.080]   but you just kind of, nobody else did anything either,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.360]   but you just kind of inherited.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.840]   Like you don't love being single,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.080]   and the Bible says it's a gift,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.360]   but you just can't really get there,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.440]   and it feels like time's ticking away,
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.720]   and family just seems like less and less
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.000]   of a possibility for you.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.840]   A pit is a problem that has graduated
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.040]   into something that you are all out stuck in
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.280]   that you do not wanna be in.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.800]   It's a situation you want out of,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.360]   but do not have the power to get out of.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.200]   And what I wanna talk about tonight
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   is what you need to know when you're stuck in a pit,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.320]   because we've all been in them.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.360]   The balloon drop story, that's fun and games,
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.240]   but that was not my worst pit, not by a long shot.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.640]   I've been in the pit of a pornography addiction,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.600]   partying, thinking that's better than God,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.120]   and then not being able to stop
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.480]   once I figured out God was better,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.640]   still not being able to stop.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.760]   Being ashamed of myself, ashamed of the story.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.800]   There was a time when I couldn't say that to anybody,
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.880]   let alone myself, the way I just said it to you.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.400]   The pit of shame and guilt from the life that I'd lived
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.000]   before I was walking with Jesus.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.040]   The pit of family death, lost a mom, lost a brother.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.000]   I'm gonna tell you a little more about that tonight.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.360]   Life can go really low.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.480]   And we're gonna see tonight a man in the Scriptures
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.240]   whose life has gone very, very low,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.800]   and that is of course the man Jonah.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.240]   And he prays a prayer in Jonah chapter two
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.000]   that we're gonna see tonight,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.840]   that offers some insight that is transferable
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.400]   from his pit to mine and to yours.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.720]   And if we look closely at that prayer,
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.240]   I am confident that his is a prayer worth praying for you,
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   for me, no matter what your pit is right now,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.840]   no matter what you're stuck in, no matter whether it is.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.320]   Any of the things I just named
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.960]   are something that I'm not creative enough
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.640]   to even think about ahead of time.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.280]   Jonah chapter two.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.160]   Now, as David taught last week,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.360]   Jonah was more of a warning to avoid, right?
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.600]   So Jonah, in chapter one, we find him on the run from God,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.760]   he's running from God, he wants nothing to do
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.360]   with God's assignment for his life.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.400]   And so he runs and he lands himself in a pit,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.760]   a literal one, the belly of a fish.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.600]   But in chapter two,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.680]   something about him has dramatically changed.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.840]   And there's something about him
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.520]   that he is inside the belly of a literal fish, okay?
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.000]   Talk about a pit, he is below sea level, okay?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   In an animal, okay?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.520]   That's where he is at, in the stomach of an animal,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.040]   moving around, and he prays a prayer out of that pit
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.200]   that gives him insight about how we can relate to ours.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.560]   Now, I wanna pause right here, just before we dive in,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.800]   I understand that many of you have an intellectual problem
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.680]   with picturing a man in the belly of a fish, okay?
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.080]   Like, you just can't get there, it seems weird,
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.200]   it's too miraculous for you, it's a whale of a tale,
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.120]   it's just too much, okay?
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.640]   So however you would say it,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.320]   there's just no way that you can possibly picture
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.560]   a man inside the belly of a fish.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.400]   And I just wanna tell you,
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.360]   I wanna be an intellectually honest person too.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.480]   So I wanna tell you how I think about that.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.600]   Jesus believed in the literal story of Jonah.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.480]   And Jesus rose again from the grave, all right?
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.080]   So listen, if you ever predict your own death
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.720]   and rise again from the grave,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.920]   whatever you say about Jonah will be good enough for me.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.880]   I will just believe everything you believe,
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.560]   we will do everything you say,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.720]   and you can have Easter, you can be the boss, okay?
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.160]   But until then, because Jesus actually predicted
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   his own death and rose again from the grave,
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.440]   we're gonna go with whatever he believes.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.520]   And he believed that this was an actual literal story.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.120]   So here comes Jonah, prayers from the pit, chapter two.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.160]   From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God,
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.760]   from inside the fish, that is a very low, low in life,
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.280]   that is a very low valley,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.520]   that is what you'd be tempted to call rock bottom.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.120]   Let's just affirm this is really, really, really bad.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.640]   And he said in this bad moment, in my distress,
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.720]   how interesting is this?
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.840]   In my distress, I called to the Lord
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.680]   and he answered me, past tense.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.000]   For from deep in the realm of the dead,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I called for help and you listened to my cry, past tense.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.040]   Now, let me tell you why that's crazy to me.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.120]   If it was me, I would not be in the belly of a fish going,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.360]   God, I called and you answered.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.440]   I would say, please answer.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.600]   Current, like I'm in this problem right now,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.640]   I'm calling, will you please answer?
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.440]   From deep, from the realm of the dead,
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.000]   I am calling for help, please listen to my cry.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.160]   But he's praying past tense as if it's already done.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.560]   Where's that confidence come from?
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.600]   How's that possible?
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.920]   How can you pray like that in the middle of that situation?
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.520]   I'm more tempted to pray like, hello, hello, hello.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.680]   God, are you there?
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.040]   Are you there, right there?
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.000]   And he is saying, God, just calmly, like God's right there.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.960]   I called to you, you answered me.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.000]   From deep in the realm of the dead,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.720]   I called for help and you listened to my cry.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.480]   How can you pray with confidence like that in your pit?
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.760]   The answer is not because you know
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.000]   you're gonna get out of there,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.800]   but because you know God is with you there.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.880]   Jonah knows God is right there.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.800]   He's not distant, he's not far away.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.720]   He's not just pushing Jonah off.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.320]   He is close by.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.120]   So one thing you might wanna know about your pit
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.160]   is that God hears your prayers from the pit.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.840]   God, the God, the creator God,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.560]   hears your prayers from the pit.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.520]   However low it is, no matter what your pit is called,
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.440]   no matter what you've done,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.960]   no matter what you did to get yourself into it,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.040]   no matter what somebody else did to get you into it,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.160]   wherever you are in life,
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.000]   however low rock bottom is for you,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.720]   God hears your prayers from that very moment.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.160]   And you never know when you are gonna need that.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.040]   I mentioned to you that I lost my brother.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.520]   I've shared that story here at the porch
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.400]   before a few months ago,
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.000]   but it was three years ago and it was during church
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.040]   over at the Fort Worth campus.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   And I got a phone call and it was his girlfriend
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   who said, "Hey, he didn't make it."
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.880]   It's the kind of thing
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.680]   that doesn't really need any explanation.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.120]   I had been there before
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.000]   when my mom had passed away a few years prior.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And when that happened, I walked outside,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.640]   I hung up the phone, walked outside,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.400]   and I got in my car door and it was the instant pit.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.920]   Okay, some of you had a moment like this,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.200]   some of you maybe not,
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.360]   but that is a moment where the loss of life
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.880]   of someone who is close to you
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.000]   is just the most close reality.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.120]   There's nowhere to run from it.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.160]   You're just in it.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.000]   You're just there.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.840]   There's nothing you can say.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.160]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.400]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.040]   You can't hug your way out of it.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.480]   You can't pray your way out of it.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.440]   Nobody, I mean, there's nothing you can do.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.320]   You are in a pit.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.840]   You can't encourage your way out of it.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.200]   There's nothing you can do for that,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.160]   at least immediate moment, you are stuck.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.800]   And what I did was I hung up the phone,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.400]   I hopped in my car,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.280]   got ready to get on the highway.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.120]   But before I put the car in reverse,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.800]   I just shut the door and I looked out the windshield,
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.960]   put my hands around the steering wheel.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.600]   And I said one sentence out loud,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.360]   God, I can't see you, but I know you're there.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.240]   That was it.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.080]   And I walked through the hardest week of my entire life,
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.800]   not alone.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.880]   It was a pit.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.920]   No little, there was nothing anybody can say.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.120]   No pastor's trick, no preacher's trick.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.240]   There was no little saying.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.200]   There's no little Christian proverb out there
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.160]   that can take away all the pain of that exact situation.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.080]   But I wasn't alone.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.440]   As soon as I was there, I knew God was with me.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.200]   It made a difference, big time.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.120]   And you never know, some of you are there right now
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.720]   and you just need to know God is with you.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.960]   He is aware.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.760]   You might not be experiencing his best right now.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.200]   And that might mean that you have gotten
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.720]   a little frustrated towards him,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.800]   or maybe not even spoke to him or thought about him
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.200]   in a long, long, long, long time.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.040]   But guess what?
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.960]   He is right there.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.800]   It says in the scripture,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.120]   God is near to the broken heart.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.760]   And that includes you even if you broke your own heart.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.120]   As we saw last week, you can run from God,
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.400]   but you can't outrun him.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   There is no way you could ever end up alone, truly alone,
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.160]   because God can hear your prayers from the pit.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.240]   You need to know that if you're in a hard spot.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.520]   Verse three, back to Jonah's prayer.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.400]   You, God, hurled me into the depths,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.480]   into the very heart of the seas.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.160]   And the current swirled about me.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   So that's his physical situation right there.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.320]   Literal, the current swirled about me.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.560]   That's not spiritual language.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.080]   It's not one of those, you know, you read the prayer
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.440]   and you're like, the current swirled about you.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.280]   What does that even mean?
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.600]   It literally means the currents swirled about him
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.520]   while he was in the water.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.800]   All your waves and breakers, you're like, what are those?
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.160]   Literal waves, they swept over me.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.680]   I said, I've been banished from your sight.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.720]   Surely you can't see this, God.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.920]   That's how he used to feel.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.000]   Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.160]   The engulfing waters, not a metaphor, real deal.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.440]   The engulfing waters threatened me.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.860]   The deep surrounded me.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.080]   Seaweed was wrapped around my head.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.840]   I don't know how bad it's going for you,
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.520]   but you do not have seaweed on your face right now.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.420]   I'm looking out at you, no seaweed.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.640]   To the roots of the mountains, I sank down.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.880]   The earth beneath barred me in forever.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.680]   Some of you know what that feels like,
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.920]   sands, seaweed, all right, without the seaweed.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.800]   They just feel like you're locked in it forever.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.480]   Like you can't get out.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.720]   You've been sad for what feels like a decade.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.580]   You've been upset since somebody broke up with you.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.340]   You haven't been yourself since you lost your job.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.500]   Some of you know what that feels like.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.220]   Listen to what Jonah says.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.420]   Listen to what he knows that you might need to know
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.980]   and I might need to know.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.520]   But you, Lord, my God brought my life up from the pit.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.660]   Now that's another one of those interesting things to say.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.220]   How exactly can you pray,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.660]   he brought my life up from the pit while you are still there?
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.420]   How can that be?
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.820]   Now he moves to confidence that his situation is changing.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.940]   How does he know his situation is changing
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.540]   in the moment while he's in it?
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.060]   Does he know God's plan for the situation
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.900]   before it happens?
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.940]   Nope.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.580]   Can his prayers make God change the situation?
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.360]   You know, kind of name and claim your outcome
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.060]   and you know, kind of pray God into doing what you want?
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.900]   Nope.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.460]   So how, how can you know your situation is changing
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.380]   while you're still in it?
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.100]   Here's how Jonah knew.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.100]   Jonah knew the pit itself was God changing the situation.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.500]   That very moment, that very situation,
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.780]   that very place he felt stuck was actually moving him
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.780]   back into the plan of God.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.900]   Think about it.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.900]   He was in a fish.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.500]   Fish move.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.940]   They swim places.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.020]   And right at that very moment,
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.140]   Jonah is being transported back
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.900]   to the original purpose of God for his life.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.060]   Jonah is actually being taken back to the thing
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.920]   God told him to do in chapter one.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.540]   That very moment was not,
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.260]   and it feels so bad when you're in a pit,
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.020]   it feels like God is punishing you, not pursuing you.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.540]   But what Jonah realized was this is not this moment,
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.380]   this dark, dark moment is not God pushing me away
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.860]   and putting me in timeout.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.540]   This is God helping me make up for lost time.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.900]   This is him acting in my life.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.340]   The punishment is the pursuit of God.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.060]   There are so many moments in life
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.180]   when we feel like God's judging us
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.540]   when judgment is not anywhere on his mind.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.680]   And when the circumstance feels bad,
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.140]   we just assume there's no way it could be constructive,
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.820]   no way it could be helpful, no way it could be useful,
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.820]   no way it could be doing anything to you
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.580]   or through you or for you.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.180]   And God is so much bigger than you, man.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.240]   I have no idea what you're up against right now.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.080]   And I don't wanna get up here
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.660]   and give you simple answers and pretend I do.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.920]   I know better, life's hard, it's complicated.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.020]   But I know this, what God has done for Jonah
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.940]   and what God has done all throughout the scripture
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.100]   from start to finish is take something
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.040]   that feels impossible and random and meaningless,
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.460]   like it's just pain that nobody else maybe even knows about,
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.540]   and he uses that very stuck situation
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.500]   that you can't get out of to get you into the situation
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.600]   that you should be in.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.500]   Does it all over the scripture.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.000]   Jonah realized the pit is the plan of God.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.920]   I feel loved right now.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.200]   You Lord are bringing my life up from the pit
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.400]   at this very moment.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.540]   So I just wanna tell you simply,
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.160]   God has a plan for your pit.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.060]   God has a plan for your pit.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.320]   And look, I was scared to write that down
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.680]   because I thought some of you would think,
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.400]   oh, the preacher always says there's a plan.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.300]   Of course, the guy with the microphone said there's a plan.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.660]   Is that just what they teach you to say?
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.380]   When do they pull you guys aside and teach you to say that?
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.300]   Listen, the Bible teaches all over the place.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.700]   Jonah is just one example.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.340]   That God has a plan for every pit
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.720]   that you could possibly ever endure or ever see.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.500]   And I am not telling you,
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.820]   I am not telling you that whatever you're facing is easy.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.140]   I know better, I've seen pain, I've seen hardship.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.580]   I know it's not easy.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.980]   I'm also not telling you that you can know
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.220]   every single detail and explanation
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.220]   for why hardship in your life exists.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.540]   I know better than that too.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.400]   I'm not saying we can know all the reasons
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.640]   for why hardship is in your life.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.440]   I'm saying we can know at least one.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.340]   Because God is after you.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.980]   He wants to connect with you.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.840]   And he wants you to connect you
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.020]   for his purpose for you from here on out.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.820]   That's at least one thing he's doing, at the minimum.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.580]   I've seen God do it in my life over and over.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.700]   Another example from kind of some family hardship,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.260]   well, not kind of family hardship, absolute family tragedy.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.260]   When I was 18 years old, I got a phone call,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.460]   another pit, I gotta stop answering my phone.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.420]   But I got a phone call and it was,
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.020]   this time it was, this was before the previous story.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.260]   So this was when I was 18 and I got a phone call
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.820]   and they just said, hey, your mom is sick.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.820]   And they're pretty sure that it's cancer.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.700]   And a few phone calls later and I found out
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.140]   over the next few weeks, it was cancer.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.680]   It's a very serious form of ovarian cancer.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.780]   And which is very lethal and very scary.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.180]   And my mom and I, from that point,
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.740]   got to share two more years of life together on this earth.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.580]   Two more years.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.140]   And you need to understand something.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.500]   Before that two years, the previous 18 years
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.940]   were marked by pretty much spiritual shallowness.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.740]   We never really talked about God.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.140]   We go to church on Christmas and Easter,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.260]   poke our heads in, I assumed we were Christians
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.600]   'cause after all, we were Texans.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.800]   And so I just assumed that we're Christians
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.620]   and she's a Christian and I'm a Christian
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.600]   and that's how it is.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   But that's what you think about at weddings and funerals
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.080]   and stuff like that.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.360]   And it was just complete shallowness.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.080]   Never really, I don't think I have a single memory
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.360]   of her talking about God before the diagnosis.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.680]   And over the next two years,
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.900]   God didn't just revitalize our relationship with each other,
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.680]   but God actually brought us
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.880]   into real relationship with him.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.560]   We talked about Christ
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   in ways we never would have been willing before.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.880]   We talked about prayer, we talked about faith,
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.600]   we talked how to deal with the cancerous pit
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.440]   that we were all in
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.640]   and our whole family didn't ask to be thrown into.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.120]   We had conversations like the one
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.280]   we're having right here tonight,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.880]   wrestling with the mysteries and the hurt
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.520]   and the tension of the unknowns.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.960]   We had all those conversations.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.560]   And yeah, it was a pit.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.040]   And yeah, it didn't end the way we wanted.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.360]   And yeah, it was a long two years
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.920]   to see your mom struggle like that.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.520]   And I don't pretend to know,
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.920]   I would not insult my mom's memory
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.720]   by even suggesting that it was easy
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   or that I'm satisfied
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.960]   'cause I know everything I wanna know.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.240]   I don't know everything about that situation I wanna know.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.960]   I know one thing about that situation I need to know.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.200]   God's plan was to come for both of us
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.240]   and he got us both.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.800]   He got both of us.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.040]   I turned my life over to him right in that very season.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.280]   I knew when that introduced itself into my life,
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.320]   I knew I was either gonna be all in with God
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.400]   or I was gonna be all out with God.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.920]   That was a fork in the road for me.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.480]   A pit will do that to you, by the way, with God.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.560]   And I realized I'm either gonna be all in with you, God,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.760]   or I'm gonna be all out with you
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.600]   and I'm just gonna rage against this situation
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.120]   because I don't understand it, it's wrong,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.360]   how could a loving God do this?
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.400]   And I'm out and those are my two options.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.960]   And I'm literally praying between those two options
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.880]   as an 18 year old thinking about them.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.960]   And God used that very situation
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.360]   to soften my heart towards him
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.000]   because I saw the way he had softened
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.040]   my mom's heart towards him.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.080]   It changed everything.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.000]   I don't know why all the pain was necessary to do that.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.640]   I don't pretend to know.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.160]   I know that the pit itself created space
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.640]   for the plan of God, which is always kind.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.680]   I don't know how he's gonna do that in your life.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.000]   I have no idea.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.760]   God's way too creative to do the same thing
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.600]   in the same way to you.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.280]   God's way too creative to do the same thing
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.840]   in the same way twice, all right?
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.760]   So I have no idea exactly how he's gonna show up for you.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.600]   I don't know what the specific purposes are,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.200]   but I know that there's purpose.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.440]   Nothing is random, nothing is meaningless.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.280]   And even when you think you're stuck,
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.880]   you have the opportunity if you trust him
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.720]   to actually be moving back into the plan of God.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.600]   He's that good.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:54.800]   Back to Jonah one more time, verse seven.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   "When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.240]   "and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple."
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.960]   And then this is his finest moment, last two verses.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.360]   "Those who cling," listen to this, this is so big.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.840]   "Those who cling to worthless idols
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.000]   "turn away from God's love for them,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.600]   "but I, with shouts of grateful praise,
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.400]   "will sacrifice to you what I have vowed I will make good.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.640]   "I will say salvation comes from the Lord."
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.600]   End of prayer.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.480]   Now look, I don't know how you would end this prayer,
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.640]   but I would pray by saying,
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.840]   God, now that we've gotten all that sorted out,
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.400]   get me the heck out of here.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.960]   That's how I would have ended the prayer.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.720]   But he doesn't even pray anything about his situation.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.920]   Nothing about the situation does he even mention.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.360]   It's almost like he forgot about it.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.080]   And he's just saying, salvation is from God.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.440]   My devotion is going to God.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.920]   Worthless idols, ha, I've done that, I'm out.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.320]   I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.400]   That's what I was doing
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.160]   when I was chasing the idol of comfort
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.680]   that led me out of the plan of God
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.320]   and into a pit in the first place.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.840]   I am done with clinging to worthless idols
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.320]   because that's just turning away from God's love for me,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.560]   he says right there in verse eight.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.000]   Those who cling to worthless idols
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.080]   turn away from God's love.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.200]   And I'm done doing that.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.520]   God, you have all my devotion.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.360]   End of prayer.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.440]   He gives his devotion first,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.600]   regardless of whether his situation gets better.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.360]   Can we just admit we don't do that?
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.040]   You know what we do with our devotion to God
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.480]   while we're in a pit?
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   We like to bargain with God.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.160]   Here's what that sounds like.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.800]   God, if you get me out of this DUI,
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.440]   I will never get drunk again.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.640]   I'm done, I'll be your man.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.000]   If you will let me not be pregnant,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.080]   I will never sleep with him again, I promise.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.360]   Or anyone else, won't even think about it.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.680]   Sex will be out of my vocabulary,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.760]   won't even talk about it.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.680]   Just get me out of this situation
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.120]   and I will devote myself to you.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.920]   God, if you can get us back together after the breakup,
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.280]   we will honor you, we will honor you, we will honor you.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.680]   And I'm telling you, that's so backward.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.400]   Jonah doesn't even wait for that.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.080]   He doesn't hold back his devotion.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.120]   He just gives it to God.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.080]   And he says, God, he doesn't say,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.480]   God, if you change this, I'll go with you.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.240]   He says, I'll go with you whether you change this or not.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.040]   Because you're where life is found.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.320]   Some of you, your biggest problem,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.720]   it's not that you're in a pit.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.280]   It's that you don't have anything worth chasing
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.160]   if you got out.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.280]   You got worthless idols everywhere.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.200]   Wasn't idol, anything but God.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.720]   Anything, anything but God.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.920]   Money, success, sex, companionship, marriage,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.400]   respect, your resume, anything other than God.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.000]   And if you chase those,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.240]   you turn away from God's love for you.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.680]   That's why Jonah says, hey, let's just settle this deal now.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.520]   While I'm in this pit,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.480]   I'm gonna take advantage of the opportunity
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.440]   to decide what kind of man I'm gonna be from here
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.640]   because I am done being the man
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.720]   who chases worthless idols.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.560]   I'm going with God no matter what happens,
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.520]   if he ever lets me out of here or not.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.880]   The last thing you'd wanna know about being in your pit
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.520]   is turning to God right now is your best option.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.280]   That's the best thing you can do.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.840]   No matter how complicated it is,
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.720]   even though God might not be a quick fix
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.280]   for your situation right now,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.800]   even if that doesn't answer all your questions
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.920]   or solve all your problems,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.160]   the best thing you can do at this very moment
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.480]   is you can turn to God.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.720]   It is your best option.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.080]   I can remember being a Christian years ago.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.600]   And as a Christian years ago,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.360]   I was so far in the pit of pornography and partying,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.880]   I thought maybe it's not even worth it to turn around.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.240]   I bet God's so mad at me.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.200]   I'm mad at me.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.920]   It might be better just to keep going, man, and give up.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.000]   Not true.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.600]   Your best option is to turn to God right now.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.120]   When we get in a hard situation, we all weigh our options.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.840]   That's what we all have in common.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.720]   And God is always the best one.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.240]   It might not get better fast.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.520]   It might not be a quick fix,
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.840]   but it is always the very best choice
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.520]   you can make for yourself and those around you.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.280]   It might not uncomplicate things by tomorrow.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.320]   It only takes one decision to complicate things
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.820]   and to uncomplicate them, it can take a long time.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.840]   But turning yourself into God, surrendering to Him,
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.040]   deciding your devotion will go to Him right now
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.400]   is your very best option.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.840]   Some of you, I know, it's like,
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   hey, you end up hugging a toilet every weekend.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.400]   You're like, yeah, the headaches are bad.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.380]   And yeah, my friends are not,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.480]   my real friends are disappearing.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.500]   All I got are bar buddies,
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.020]   but I mean, I've kind of already gone this far.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:18.920]   Maybe I should keep going.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.600]   No, that's crazy.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.560]   You should turn yourself back to God now.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.200]   That's the best thing you can do.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.000]   I just got out of a relationship.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.280]   I thought it was going to the altar.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.100]   What should I do?
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.520]   You should turn to God now.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.820]   It is your best option.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.100]   I lost my job.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.940]   What do I do?
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.120]   Turn to God right now.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:40.960]   Start walking with Him.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.800]   Don't wait for some magical, miraculous interruption.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.280]   Don't wait for God to snap His fingers
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.800]   and make everything simple again.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.040]   Turn to God now and start walking with Him.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.120]   We'll close with this story.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.240]   When I was 14 years old,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.720]   we got into a crazy situation, life-threatening situation.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.520]   My mother was driving our car.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.840]   It was a minivan to be exact.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.280]   She was in a minivan phase.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.080]   And so she had a minivan and there was me,
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.720]   my best friend was 14 years old,
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   best friends in the car, little sister,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.520]   and then little stepbrother and little stepsister
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   who were very young.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.120]   And we lived out in the woods in East Texas.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.800]   And if you're not from East Texas,
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.200]   then you're picturing, oh, out in the woods.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.020]   What does that mean?
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.860]   You know, a few trees?
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.420]   No, way woods, like dirt road.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.280]   We lived way out there.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.880]   And there was this little wooden bridge with no rails on it.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.840]   There was a creek below it.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.900]   And there was this little wooden bridge
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.260]   that we had to cross anytime we wanted to get in and out
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.100]   of the place we were living.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.400]   We were 15 minutes from being in a small town.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.000]   So you go to the small town and then you go out a long way.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.440]   And then you go down the dirt road
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.940]   that they write horror stories about.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.400]   And that is where we lived.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.240]   And so you go down there
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.840]   and across this rickety wooden bridge every time.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.260]   Well, it was a few days after Christmas
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.280]   when I was in eighth grade
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.840]   and it was obviously December and freezing
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.920]   and it was raining and we needed to get out
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.000]   to take my friend home.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.340]   And we loaded up everybody into the car.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.500]   And as we were going,
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.080]   we saw that the bridge was a little bit underwater,
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.720]   which is like, that's a little bit of a concern typically,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.920]   but when you cross it every day,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.940]   it kind of fills you with some confidence.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.880]   And so we started to kind of cruise down towards it.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.200]   And all of a sudden we went down towards it even farther
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.120]   and the headlights kind of flashed up
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.200]   where we could see that it was about a hundred yards
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.520]   or more that was underwater.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.680]   And so it wasn't just the bridge right there.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.760]   It was like the roads coming down to the bridge
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.040]   where all the creek had overflowed that far.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.620]   And it was up, the water was up to the door handle.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.660]   Okay, almost to the window where the window of the car is.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.780]   And so that's where it was.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.340]   So we noticed that all at the same time
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.740]   and mom immediately puts it into reverse
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.580]   and tries to get back.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.340]   Well, we can't back up.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.140]   It literally, you literally couldn't move.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.780]   We got minivan tires on a mud, on a red mud road.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.060]   It's not gonna work.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.060]   And so she puts it in reverse, no can do.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.340]   Puts it back into park, hoping it would at least stop.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.940]   The mud is making a slide down towards the bridge.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.700]   Okay, we need to get out of a window quickly.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.140]   Just abandon the car.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.760]   The electricity immediately goes out
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.180]   and the headlights are off, the doors are locked
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.080]   and the windows will not come down.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.520]   That's where we all are.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.260]   My mom starts shrieking.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.440]   We're all terrified.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.600]   I'm like, this is crazy right now.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.840]   I don't know what to do.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.040]   My friend is freaking out.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.240]   He's kind of staring off into space
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.480]   and then water starts coming in the vehicle, freezing.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.360]   All right, freezing cold.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.300]   We all pick our feet up and we are stuck.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.560]   And now listen, remember this.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.600]   It's not like we're gonna float onto the bridge
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.000]   and the guardrails will keep us up.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.100]   It's like, if we go off the bridge,
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.420]   we're gonna sink in that vehicle
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.820]   and that's gonna be the end of the end.
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.820]   And that's the situation we're in.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.660]   And at that point, we start looking around for our options.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.940]   Like, what are we gonna do?
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.140]   We got water coming in.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.060]   If we open a door, it's just gonna all come in.
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.020]   So we can't do that.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.900]   Can't open a window.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.980]   We could try 911, no service.
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.060]   Should I just swing around
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.700]   and kick the window open with my legs?
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.140]   I mean, like, what do we do?
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.780]   And I don't know how other than the grace of God
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.940]   because there was no electricity in the vehicle whatsoever.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.600]   But my mom's window, the driver window rolled down
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.400]   and the water was just at the level
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.720]   where when the window went down, water didn't come in.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.800]   And she got out, hung on the door to find her footing,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.560]   made sure there was ground underneath her.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.400]   And we all went out.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.840]   She squeezed in a call to 911.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.980]   She got one bar of service to call 911.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.240]   We got out, put the kids in our arms
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.400]   and we walked out slowly to higher ground.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.240]   Slow, slow, slow.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.760]   It was freezing.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.720]   If you've ever seen the movie "Titanic,"
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.720]   you'll see it in a whole new light
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.080]   after you experience this one.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.000]   It was completely freezing.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.840]   And so when we just slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.680]   started walking.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:47.000]   And I have no idea what that situation is for you
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.200]   where you're like, hey, I'm out of good options.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.320]   Okay, I got water outside.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.760]   If I open the door, something bad happens.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.120]   If I open the window, something bad happens.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.480]   If I pick my feet up, something bad happens.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.160]   If I leave, something bad happens.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   The water's freezing and we might drown anyway.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.160]   I got nowhere to go.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.280]   The water is rushing in, figuratively speaking,
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.120]   in my life.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.420]   Like, what do I do, man?
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.240]   The answer is the window of opportunity
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.160]   for you to walk with God is still open.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.960]   There might, I'm not saying there's no consequences
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.620]   for whatever has been going on in your life.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.560]   I'm not saying it's gonna uncomplicate itself immediately.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.760]   Whatever it is you're up against,
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.280]   I'm saying God's window of opportunity for you is open now
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.040]   and you can slowly start to put one foot in front of you
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.920]   of the other to walk with him.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.080]   He will help you do it.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.000]   Whatever you're stuck in,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.660]   whatever your life was supposed to be about,
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.360]   but then now it's not and you're just stuck right there
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.020]   and then just, it feels like the situation's temperature
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.760]   is kind of rising and there's pressure
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.120]   and you don't know what to do with yourself,
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.220]   the answer is open your Bible
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.440]   and realize there is a good God behind it
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.240]   who's after you.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.380]   He's opened a window for you to walk with him.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.200]   It might not be fast.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.160]   You might come out and show some marks,
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.080]   but it is better than staying where you are.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.400]   And I don't know what you're up against.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.160]   I'm telling you though, if you don't walk with God,
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   it's gonna get worse.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.920]   Some of you I know are in a situation where you're going,
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.320]   I'm pregnant and I don't wanna be a mom.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.400]   I'm not ready.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.220]   I can't pay.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.060]   I can't provide.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.000]   Why would I bring a kid into this situation?
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.880]   95% of the world says I should
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.840]   and so maybe I should just sit here and terminate.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.720]   Walk with God one step at a time.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.360]   No people will help you do that.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.800]   There is always a window to get to him.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.700]   He's present with you.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.140]   I don't know what water's rushing in,
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.960]   creating pressure in your life right now.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.520]   I know that there's a good God who's with you.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.820]   He's got a plan for it.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.480]   And there is a possibility right now
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.480]   that you could walk with him.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.880]   And I promise you this, it is your best option.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.260]   No matter how low it goes,
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.240]   no matter what the threats are against you,
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.320]   no matter what the consequences are for your own actions
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.360]   or the actions of others,
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   your very best option is to get to higher ground
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.680]   one step at a time.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.760]   Let's pray together.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:17.960]   God, there's so much complexity in our lives
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.240]   that we have invited in or others have put in
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.440]   or just the broken world surprised us with.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.920]   We have landed ourselves in more pits than we can count.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.720]   We don't know what to do.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.020]   We don't know our way out.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:37.640]   Thank you, God, that you saw fit to provide a way out.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.540]   That if we walk with you, we don't have to ignore wisdom
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.680]   and eat the fruit of our ways anymore, as Proverbs 2 says.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.300]   We can walk with you and keep our way pure.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.780]   We can experience something better.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.080]   God, there is something better.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.680]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   You said you came to give us life and life abundant.
