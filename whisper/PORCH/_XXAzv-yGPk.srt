1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,260
 - All right, what's up guys?

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,720
 Welcome everybody that is tuning in online

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,080
 or wherever you are joining us from,

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,920
 and we are excited to continue this series, Therapy.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,560
 We kicked it off last week

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,200
 and we began to explore a crucial topic,

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,400
 especially right now, and that's mental health.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,720
 And how the church and really the Bible

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,260
 speaks to these issues,

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,560
 because it does over and over and over.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,160
 This is an issue that we had planned before, you know,

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,360
 COVID and Corona had even happened,

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,900
 doing a series called Therapy,

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,760
 addressing mental health,

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,140
 specifically these first few weeks

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,600
 we're camping out on anxiety

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,680
 'cause it's too big of an issue to hit in one night.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,360
 But furthermore, we had planned this

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,380
 even before COVID happened.

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,220
 And then it was like,

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,240
 if our nation ever needed to go through therapy,

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,420
 it is now, this is a time where we all need to do some work.

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,520
 And specifically as it relates to anxiety and depression

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,480
 and having mental health.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
 God cares about you.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,760
 He wants you to experience that.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,440
 And so we're gonna look for the next few weeks at his word.

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,840
 There was a study that was done,

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,360
 I referenced last week of just how important this is

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,960
 is anxiety is not going away.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,400
 If anything, it's getting worse.

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,080
 And it referenced that the average psychiatric patient

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,840
 in 1950 had the same levels of anxiety

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,260
 as a young person today.

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,100
 Think about that.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,320
 And yet for Christians,

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,080
 God over and over talks about this subject

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,500
 where he says, I want you to experience a life

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,160
 that is not ruled and owned by fear or anxiety.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,140
 We start by telling a kind of funny thing

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,240
 that's relevant to our team.

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,000
 I know y'all have all heard it, but the term dog mom.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
 I don't know how long, how long has dog mom been around?

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,120
 Like a while?

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,920
 Maybe years.

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,680
 It feels like this thing just came onto the scene

48
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,020
 and people went from like, oh, I just really love dogs

49
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,680
 to no, this is my fur baby.

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,320
 I see them not as my pet, but as my child.

51
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,240
 There's this phenomenon of dog moms.

52
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,600
 How do you know if somebody is a dog mom

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,440
 or what does this look like?

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,640
 It looks like what it sounds like.

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
 It's somebody who sees their pet as like, this is my baby.

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,980
 They set up other play dates with other dog moms

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,800
 for them and their fur babies to go play together.

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,320
 They're thinking about Christmas presents for their dog.

59
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,180
 They're thinking about Halloween costumes,

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,620
 months in advance, gourmet food.

61
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,080
 They go to the nines 'cause they see this dog,

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
 not as a dog, but as their own pet.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,080
 The most extreme example of this in my life,

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,300
 I've joked about before,

65
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,720
 is a girl that was on our team named Emily.

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,880
 Emily was extra as it related to her dog.

67
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
 She had picked out her Halloween costume

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,360
 for her dog months in advance.

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,720
 Every time she went to Target, she said, and I quote,

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,220
 "It's like a chance for me to go get a little toy

71
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,720
 "for my little baby."

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,280
 If that wasn't enough, she gave her dog,

73
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,500
 she's got two middle names.

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,960
 In other words, yeah, I said last week

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,440
 that counseling should not be the first line of defense

76
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,320
 for anybody, but if you're giving your dogs middle names,

77
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,840
 it may be something you consider.

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,160
 But she gives her dogs like double names.

79
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,060
 Like if you're from the South,

80
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,840
 you probably have heard of people that go by two names.

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
 They're like, "Hey, my name's Mary Claire,"

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
 or "I'm Sarah Beth," and you're like, "Oh, hey, Sarah."

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,560
 And they're like, "Actually, it's Sarah Beth."

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,480
 This is what Emily does with her dogs.

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,920
 So if you're around her dog, Cooper James,

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,120
 can't even believe that I'm acknowledging that,

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,320
 and you're like, "Oh, hey, Cooper,"

88
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,040
 she's like, "It's actually Cooper James."

89
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,240
 She's just so extreme.

90
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,040
 She's the most extreme version of a dog mom I've ever seen.

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,280
 She loves her dogs incredibly.

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,160
 Now with that in mind, let me ask you

93
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,400
 kind of a funny question.

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 Do you think that she loves her dogs

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
 more than God loves you?

96
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,680
 Do you think she thinks about her dogs?

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,920
 Like that's pretty extreme.

98
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,120
 If you're thinking about, "I'm going to Target.

99
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,880
 "I can't wait to go get him a toy."

100
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,440
 You're thinking about that dog.

101
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,800
 Do you think she thinks about her dogs

102
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,480
 more than God thinks about you?

103
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,520
 She really values them.

104
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,720
 Like she's like, "Hey, you can burn the house down.

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,160
 "Do not take the dogs."

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,800
 Do you think that she values, truly?

107
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,880
 Do you think she values her dogs more than God

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,760
 values you and your life?

109
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,560
 I think most of us would say, "No, no, no, no, it's crazy."

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,960
 But functionally, a lot of us live that way.

111
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,840
 We don't walk around with the mentality of like,

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
 "Hey, God loves me.

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,280
 "He's in control of everything.

114
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
 "He's for me.

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
 "He's going to provide for me.

116
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,160
 "I'm good."

117
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,800
 Most of us walk around like,

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,840
 "Hey, and if I don't do enough, it's not going to happen.

119
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,520
 "And I'm so concerned and my life's going to fall apart.

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
 "What if I lose my job?"

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,400
 And we don't have the mentality of like,

122
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,600
 "Man, I have a providing father who loves me."

123
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,880
 What's funny is when Jesus started his sermon on the Mount,

124
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,640
 he started with a question that's almost as abrupt

125
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,880
 as what I just asked you.

126
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,840
 If like, "Hey, do you think that she loves her dogs

127
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
 "more than God loves you?"

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,720
 He asked a strikingly similar question.

129
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 That's why I asked this one to his audience.

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,200
 Now to recap, last week we opened up

131
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,400
 and we covered first couple of verses

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,760
 of what Jesus taught on anxiety.

133
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,320
 Sermon on the Mount, Jesus's most famous sermon,

134
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,680
 taught it from a mountainside.

135
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,320
 It's covered a lot of topics.

136
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,720
 One of them was anxiety.

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
 People have been anxious for a long time.

138
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
 And in the middle of his conversation about anxiety,

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,040
 he asks a question related to the value of an animal

140
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,720
 and God and his value of you.

141
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
 Here's what he says.

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
 This comes from Matthew chapter six, starting in verse 24.

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
 After saying, "I tell you,

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
 "do not worry about your life,

145
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
 "but what are you gonna eat, what are you gonna drink,

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
 "what you're gonna wear," all that stuff,

147
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
 we covered last week, he says,

148
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,320
 "Look at the birds of the air."

149
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 So remember, they're outside.

150
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,960
 My guess is he sees some birds overhead and he's like,

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,400
 "Man, let me try to explain to this audience what I mean."

152
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,880
 They don't sow or reap or gather in barns.

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,120
 Now we don't use sow and reap

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,200
 'cause most of us live in the city,

155
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,320
 but that's basically like, hey, they don't plant crops

156
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,720
 and then harvest and pull up those crops

157
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,600
 and then store 'em up and calculate

158
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,840
 how much food do we have for the next winter.

159
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,040
 All of which Jesus' audience would have done.

160
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,520
 And yet your heavenly father feeds them.

161
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,480
 Are you, here's the question,

162
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,000
 are you not much more valuable to God than a bird?

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
 Jesus asks.

164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,320
 It's like he says, "Hey, look at those birds.

165
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,560
 "See them flying up there?

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,640
 "They don't do any of the responsible things that you do

167
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,960
 "in terms of food, providing, but God provides for them."

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,600
 Are you not more valuable to God than they are?

169
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,280
 Won't he provide for you?

170
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
 Hey, tell us, he wouldn't say food

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,120
 'cause most of us, we don't wake up worrying about food,

172
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,200
 but he'd say, "The birds, they don't store away

173
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,760
 "for a 401k in retirement someday.

174
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,040
 "They're not on Bumble and Hinge

175
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,720
 "and trying to put themselves in feelers out there

176
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
 "to make sure that anybody who's available,

177
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,200
 "they know that you're available and get a mate.

178
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,280
 "They're not saving up and following a budget

179
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,360
 "to get out of debt.

180
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,480
 "They're not filling out applications

181
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
 "and trying to get a job.

182
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,720
 "They're not doing any of the responsible things

183
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,720
 "that you do and God provides for them."

184
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,280
 It's like Jesus saying, "The birds, they don't even really try.

185
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,480
 "They don't even try and God provides for them.

186
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,720
 "They just fly around and they're like,

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 "'Oh, look, there's a worm and I'll eat the worm.'

188
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,440
 "And then they find a spouse, not through match.com,

189
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,480
 "but through like, 'Oh, look, she looks kind of hot.

190
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,520
 "'I'm gonna mate with her.'

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,360
 "And then got little baby birds and then it gets cold."

192
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,720
 And they're like, "I think we should go south."

193
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,600
 And yet God provides for them.

194
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,480
 Do you not think you're more valuable to God

195
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,000
 than those birds he provides for?

196
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,280
 Most of us probably again would say,

197
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,600
 "No, no, no, I think I am."

198
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,800
 But Jesus would say, "When you're worried,

199
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,520
 "you don't really believe that.

200
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,760
 "You don't really think God has promised to meet your needs."

201
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400
 What we're gonna look at for the next handful of minutes

202
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
 is one idea.

203
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
 Normally I do three points

204
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,240
 and here's the things I wanna break down.

205
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
 I wanna hammer home one of the most significant truths

206
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,480
 you can believe in this entire series.

207
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,440
 God, if you're a Christian,

208
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,360
 remember your heavenly father

209
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,800
 has promised to provide for your needs.

210
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,160
 You've gotta remember as you go through life,

211
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
 when you turn this off tonight,

212
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,880
 you could take a deep breath

213
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,520
 and I wonder how your life would change

214
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,440
 if you really went,

215
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,120
 he's gonna provide for everything I need.

216
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,800
 My heavenly father will provide for everything that I need.

217
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,160
 Not everything that I want,

218
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 not everything's always gonna go the way that I want it to,

219
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,680
 but if I need it, I'll get it.

220
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,560
 'Cause my heavenly father controls everything

221
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,640
 and he has promised to provide for everything that I need.

222
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,560
 Jesus is not saying, "Hey, don't try at life.

223
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,960
 "Don't work hard, don't stay on a budget."

224
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,160
 It's not some weird life coach being like,

225
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,120
 "Oh yeah, just sit on your hands,

226
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,600
 "everything will go fine, you'll get everything you want."

227
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
 No, it's not.

228
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,600
 If I wouldn't teach that, it says, "Be responsible,

229
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
 "fill out applications, get on a hinge."

230
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,880
 I probably shouldn't even speak about a hinge

231
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,800
 'cause I don't know anything about it.

232
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,320
 But do all of the things that you're gonna do responsibly.

233
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
 But at the end of the day, God has promised,

234
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
 he's gonna meet your needs.

235
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,040
 He will provide for what you need.

236
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,960
 And you can trust him.

237
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,320
 You are more valuable to God than a bird

238
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,560
 and he provides for them.

239
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,840
 When God looks at you,

240
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,180
 he looks at someone that was made in his own image,

241
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,680
 someone distinct from all of creation.

242
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
 Do you know how valuable you are to God?

243
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,400
 When people see the Grand Canyon, they're like,

244
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,200
 "Oh my gosh, this is amazing, it's incredible."

245
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,480
 See the Rocky Mountains, like, "Oh wow, that's astounding."

246
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,020
 When God sees those things, he's like,

247
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,160
 "Ah, Jan, they pale in comparison to you.

248
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,240
 "You were made in his image.

249
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,400
 "You were the one that he died for.

250
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,080
 "That's how valuable you are."

251
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,040
 And he's promised, "I will meet your needs.

252
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,120
 "You're more valuable to me than a bird."

253
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,000
 What I love about that question is,

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,560
 did you know that Jesus,

255
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,060
 and I know I talked with some of y'all before this,

256
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,840
 Jesus actually talks about the value of a bird,

257
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,680
 like the specific monetary amount of a bird

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
 in the book of Matthew.

259
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
 It's one of the few times in the Bible

260
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,020
 where something's monetary value is actually said.

261
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,180
 And like most of the time, we're not told like,

262
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,340
 "Oh, you know that oranges go for like a baker's dozen

263
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,880
 "to get to $2."

264
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,480
 It's one of the few times we're told,

265
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,440
 "How much do birds cost?"

266
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,400
 In Matthew chapter 10, in case you're wondering, like,

267
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,140
 "Oh, well, hey, am I more valuable to God than a bird?

268
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,000
 "Well, how valuable is a bird?"

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,500
 Jesus says four chapters later,

270
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,280
 "Two sparrows are sold for a penny,

271
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,280
 "yet not one of them will fall to the ground

272
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,140
 "outside of your father's care.

273
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,340
 "Even the very hairs on your head are numbered.

274
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,760
 "So don't be afraid.

275
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,560
 "You're worth far more than many sparrows."

276
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,860
 Jesus says, "You guys are worth,

277
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,200
 "you know how much a bird is worth.

278
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,720
 "Two for a penny, I'm not the best at math,

279
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
 "still count my fingers sometimes,

280
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,620
 "but even I know, oh, it's half a penny.

281
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,260
 "How much is a bird worth?

282
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,660
 "Are you more valuable to God than half a penny?"

283
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,460
 He gave the life of his son.

284
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,280
 There's nothing more valuable in life,

285
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,780
 in the world, in creation.

286
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,960
 It's how valuable you are to God.

287
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,280
 And he's promised, "I will provide for your needs.

288
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,120
 "I got you.

289
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,940
 "You're worth more than many birds,

290
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,720
 "and I will provide for everything you need.

291
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,720
 "You can trust me and rest and remember."

292
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,840
 This is the whole point, if you take notes, just one.

293
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,320
 "Your heavenly father will provide for your needs."

294
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,280
 He drives home the same point when he goes into clothes,

295
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,240
 talking about, they're worried about food,

296
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,840
 worried about clothes, covers both of them.

297
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,760
 He says, "Why do you worry about clothes?

298
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
 "See how the flowers in the field grow?

299
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,240
 "They don't labor and spin,

300
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,540
 "which is like they're not over there knitting

301
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,760
 "and putting things together,"

302
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,920
 which his audience would have done.

303
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,220
 "Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all of his splendor

304
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,680
 "was dressed like one of these."

305
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,580
 So Jesus points and he's like, "You're worried about clothes.

306
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,580
 "Look how fine-looking those flowers are over there."

307
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,260
 And he says, "Not even Solomon

308
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,960
 "looked as good as these guys."

309
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,120
 Now, you may not know who Solomon was.

310
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
 Solomon lived 1,000 years before Jesus.

311
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,360
 He was a king in Israel,

312
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,080
 and he was known for being the guy who had,

313
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,660
 he was the richest of the rich,

314
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,600
 arguably one of the richest people, say, in history, period,

315
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,960
 but certainly the richest in all of society

316
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
 and ancient Jewish history

317
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,680
 and the richest person in the Bible.

318
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,000
 And he says, "Not even Solomon was dressed that way."

319
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
 In other words, Solomon was the guy on MTV Cribs,

320
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,840
 if you showed up and they did pan in at his house,

321
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,120
 Solomon would be sitting out front in front of his Lambos

322
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,720
 and his posh crib and be like, "Welcome to my place,"

323
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,160
 just decked out in the finest clothes, Gucci everywhere.

324
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,120
 You know what I'm talking about.

325
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,880
 And just the finest clothes you could have.

326
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,560
 And Jesus says, "Not even the guy

327
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,320
 "who would have won best dressed in high school

328
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
 "or in the Old Testament compared anything

329
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,680
 "to these flowers over here."

330
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,480
 God's gonna dress the flowers of the field.

331
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,160
 He's thinking he doesn't care about you.

332
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,440
 He's promised he'll meet your needs.

333
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
 You could trust him.

334
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,120
 The fire, he says, let me read it.

335
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,840
 "If that's how God clothes the grass of the field,

336
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,680
 "which is here today and tomorrow's thrown into the fire,

337
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,280
 "will he not much more clothe you?"

338
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,800
 And just a side note, in case you're reading this

339
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,640
 and you're like, "Wait,

340
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,520
 "why are they throwing flowers into the fire?

341
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,840
 "That is weird."

342
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,400
 And that would be an appropriate question.

343
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,620
 Oftentimes we read the Bible so much, like Christians,

344
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,760
 that we're so desensitized to things like this.

345
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,280
 Like, yes, oh yeah, it is.

346
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,680
 That's exactly what I do with flowers.

347
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,000
 I throw them in the fire.

348
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,180
 Why would you throw flowers in the fire, Jesus?

349
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,480
 Well, the word fire is a Greek word for oven.

350
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,040
 And the way that you would cook back then

351
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,160
 is every home had a little oven inside of it.

352
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,920
 And the way that you would get the fire started

353
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,880
 is you'd put kindling underneath,

354
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,480
 and that kindling would have been made of wild flowers.

355
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,040
 You take those wild flowers, you put them underneath,

356
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,360
 and that would be how you start a fire and begin to cook.

357
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,760
 Jesus is basically saying,

358
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,080
 you know, the flowers that you guys bring home,

359
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,040
 like back then, if you brought home roses,

360
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,680
 a bouquet of roses, it wasn't like,

361
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,800
 "Oh, honey, I love you so much."

362
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
 It was like, "Hey, I brought home cooking supplies."

363
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,440
 And Jesus says, "You know, you guys,

364
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,160
 "these cooking supplies,

365
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,660
 "here and then they're gone, we burn 'em.

366
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,520
 "You're way more valuable to God."

367
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,480
 Something that just disappears.

368
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,280
 You're so valuable, He died for you.

369
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,800
 And you don't think He's gonna provide for you.

370
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:46,320
 He then says this, "Oh, you of little faith."

371
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,360
 This is a really interesting term.

372
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,840
 The word, "Oh, you of little faith," it's only two words.

373
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,400
 In English, we translated it to five,

374
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,040
 but in the original Greek, it's only two.

375
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,920
 And did you guys watch "Seinfeld" in here?

376
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,080
 Were you alive when "Seinfeld" was on?

377
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,960
 Did you watch "Seinfeld"?

378
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,400
 Ah, this is not an endorsement of "Seinfeld,"

379
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,000
 but I have seen every episode of "Seinfeld,"

380
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,160
 whether or not I would endorse or encourage that,

381
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,000
 but it's probably the only show

382
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,960
 that I've seen every episode at least one time.

383
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
 I think it's the funniest comedic show of all time.

384
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,600
 It destroys friends in "Gilmore Girls."

385
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,400
 Let me get that out of the way for everybody,

386
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,700
 talking to you, and yeah, so savage.

387
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,160
 But inside of the show, there were just like

388
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,520
 all these comedic, hilarious things.

389
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,080
 There's Jerry, Kramer, Elaine, George.

390
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,360
 In one of the shows, there was this moment where,

391
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,080
 part of the, man, I'm just talking with friends,

392
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,080
 my favorite show, in one of the episodes,

393
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,480
 Elaine is dating a guy, you guys following me?

394
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,160
 And every time you date somebody, you're kind of like,

395
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,280
 is this relationship gonna work out?

396
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,800
 And in "Seinfeld," there were always these

397
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
 hilarious quirks that would end the relationship.

398
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,400
 Like one girl had man hands, or Jerry was dating her,

399
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,880
 and he was like, "Her hands are just too big,

400
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,720
 "I just can't get over it."

401
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,460
 And another person was like, they,

402
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,200
 I can't even remember some of the different reasons

403
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,080
 why they ended up breaking up.

404
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,320
 But this one was one where Elaine, the girl,

405
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,560
 was starting to date this new guy, he's introduced,

406
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,360
 comes over, and we're introduced to him,

407
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,340
 and all of a sudden, everyone sees he's a close talker.

408
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,600
 Like they begin to pan through, like he's meeting everybody,

409
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,680
 and every time he would talk, he'd be uncomfortably close

410
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,000
 to that person and talking.

411
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
 And the joke was, he's a close talker.

412
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,260
 And the guy ends up leaving, and Elaine is sitting there

413
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,480
 with the guys, and everyone basically is like,

414
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
 you need to break up with him, he's a close talker.

415
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,880
 He's one of those guys that all of us have

416
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,120
 this person in our life where they have no sense

417
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,240
 of like personal space.

418
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,520
 They get so close that you end up having to back up

419
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,640
 a little bit, and you can feel their breath breathing on you

420
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,920
 'cause they're a close talker.

421
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,880
 And it's hilarious.

422
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,360
 Well, why is it hilarious?

423
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,480
 Well, close talker is not a term in the dictionary.

424
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,160
 It's a made up term.

425
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,760
 But my guess is everybody here, even when I said that,

426
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,260
 you knew exactly what I meant.

427
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,160
 Right?

428
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,920
 That's essentially what Jesus does with this word

429
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
 of you of little faith.

430
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
 Now, here's why I say that.

431
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
 Just like close talker is not in the dictionary,

432
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,680
 it's just two words that you hyphenate,

433
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,360
 and you're like close talker.

434
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,840
 That's what you are.

435
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,880
 Jesus, and the term for OU of little faith,

436
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,880
 involves the word for little and faith or faither.

437
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,000
 It's a word that only Jesus in the entire Bible used,

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,040
 and nowhere else in any Greek literature

439
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,400
 do we have the word that he just said there,

440
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,320
 that OU of little faith.

441
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,240
 They're like, oh, that's normal.

442
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,400
 Nope, Jesus made this word up,

443
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,840
 and it was a combination of two words, little and faither.

444
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,960
 And just like close talker, or just like,

445
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,520
 oh, you're a Debbie Downer, where it's like,

446
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
 oh, I know what you mean when you say that.

447
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,800
 His audience knew what he mean, where Jesus says,

448
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,840
 you believe God provides for all of these things,

449
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,240
 but he won't provide for you.

450
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,400
 You're a little faither.

451
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,560
 In a comedic way, he's pointing out like, man,

452
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,160
 you think God holds the moon, sun, stars, all of gravity,

453
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,360
 like he created it all, everything incredible

454
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,160
 that you've ever seen, the majesty of just the stars

455
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,800
 at night, the intricacy of the human body,

456
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,720
 and the fact that reproduction or birth,

457
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,880
 I don't know if you've ever thought about that,

458
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,780
 but all the things that are amazing,

459
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,960
 and you don't think that he will provide for you,

460
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,160
 you're a little faither.

461
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,880
 And he points out there's a relationship

462
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,720
 between the size of our faith and the size of our worry.

463
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,320
 And he says, you can trust me.

464
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
 I got you.

465
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,120
 I will provide for your needs.

466
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,320
 Your heavenly father is in control.

467
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,760
 Listen to me.

468
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,000
 He will provide for everything that you need.

469
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,760
 If you need it, he will provide it.

470
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,860
 He showed how clearly that is true

471
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,920
 when he died on the cross for your greatest need.

472
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,300
 The greatest need you will ever have in life

473
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,960
 is the fact that every action, every sinful decision

474
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,880
 that I've made and that you have made

475
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,880
 have put us in debt to God or deserving of punishment.

476
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,100
 Just like anytime you were a kid

477
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,800
 and you acted up against your parents,

478
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,720
 there would be consequences or deserving of punishment.

479
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,560
 Just like anytime you break the law,

480
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,960
 there's punishments, consequences, fines, jail time,

481
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,620
 things like that.

482
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,840
 All of us through our own decisions have broken God's law

483
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,040
 and deserve to be punished.

484
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,060
 And God has said, I will allow you to not have the punishment

485
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,960
 because I'll give my son to take

486
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,100
 and pay for your punishment, pay for your sins,

487
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,300
 pay for your crimes.

488
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,360
 That's how far I'll go to provide for your needs,

489
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,520
 your greatest need.

490
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,620
 You don't think I can help you

491
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
 with the presentation you got this week?

492
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,320
 You're a little faither.

493
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,700
 You don't think I can get you a job?

494
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,540
 You don't think I can provide for your needs?

495
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,620
 You don't think I'm big enough to handle

496
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,180
 whatever you're walking through?

497
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,840
 You're a little faither.

498
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,060
 And in a comedic, brilliant, clear way,

499
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,280
 Jesus says, you can trust your heavenly father.

500
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,700
 He's got you, controls everything.

501
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,100
 He will provide for your needs.

502
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,060
 Even by saying the idea of don't worry,

503
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,860
 which he says four times in this passage,

504
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,020
 four different times, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

505
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,960
 He's implying, I got you.

506
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,200
 Why do I say that?

507
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,960
 You cannot be a good God and say, I got you,

508
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,660
 but I'm not gonna provide for you.

509
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,640
 Why do I say that, or why do I say that?

510
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,820
 You can't be a good friend and say that.

511
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,160
 Like, here's what I mean.

512
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,400
 If we were leaving tonight, and we were all going to eat,

513
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,360
 and we were getting ready to drive together,

514
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
 and I was like, dude, you can ride with me.

515
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,860
 And as we're walking out to the parking lot,

516
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,680
 you begin to realize, oh man, I forgot my wallet.

517
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,080
 And I looked at you and I said, don't worry about it.

518
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,880
 Get in the car, drive to the restaurant,

519
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,320
 get to the restaurant, sit down, eat.

520
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,080
 At the end of the meal, waitress comes up,

521
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,680
 hey, you guys want one check or two checks?

522
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,760
 If I look at her and say, we'll take two checks,

523
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 you would look at me and go, what do you mean two checks?

524
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,480
 I told you I didn't have my wallet,

525
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,960
 and you said, don't worry about it.

526
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,080
 And if I responded with,

527
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
 (laughs)

528
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,920
 you thought I was gonna pay for you?

529
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,600
 No, I'm not gonna pay for you,

530
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,680
 I just didn't want you to worry.

531
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,840
 Worry's never a healthy, productive use of time.

532
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,680
 It doesn't make you feel good,

533
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,560
 it's bad for your blood pressure.

534
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,240
 You would look at me like, you're a bad friend,

535
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,880
 and a little crazy, and you would be right.

536
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,360
 'Cause you can't be a good friend and say,

537
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,820
 don't worry about it, but I don't got you.

538
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,160
 You can't be a good, perfect, heavenly father

539
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,060
 and say, don't worry about it, but I don't got you.

540
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,320
 He's telling you, I will provide for your needs.

541
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,960
 You can trust me.

542
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,760
 He hammers this home in the final verses

543
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,600
 of the passage where he says,

544
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,680
 therefore, do not be anxious about anything.

545
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,160
 Or do not be anxious saying, what should we eat,

546
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
 and what should we drink?

547
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,280
 What should we wear?

548
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
 Where am I gonna work, where am I gonna live?

549
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
 Who am I gonna marry?

550
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,000
 Will I be able to have kids?

551
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,880
 Don't be anxious about those things.

552
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
 For the Gentiles, that's a word for people

553
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,480
 who don't have a relationship with God.

554
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,760
 Christians, we would use the word non-believers.

555
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,040
 Non-believers run after all of those things.

556
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,440
 And your heavenly father knows that you need them all.

557
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,760
 He will provide for you.

558
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,120
 You can trust him.

559
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,760
 He's invited all of us.

560
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,400
 Work hard, be responsible.

561
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,080
 Fill out the job application.

562
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,640
 Get ready for the presentation.

563
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,240
 Do everything you can to prepare for interviewing.

564
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,320
 But at the end of the day, you don't have to worry.

565
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,840
 He's promised he will provide for your needs.

566
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,920
 He's the one who says, get in the car.

567
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
 You don't need your wallet.

568
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,040
 You can ride with me, I'll drive, and I got you.

569
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,880
 You can trust me.

570
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,440
 You know what the second most repeated command is?

571
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,200
 You guys know this 'cause, Alison, do you know?

572
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,520
 What's the second most repeated command in the Bible?

573
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,520
 I wouldn't have known it had I not been preparing for this.

574
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,560
 The most repeated command in the Bible

575
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,520
 we've talked about is do not fear.

576
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,280
 There's an Olympic ceremony.

577
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,120
 Number one, who would get the gold medal in the Bible

578
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,040
 for most repeated command?

579
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,680
 Do not fear.

580
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,320
 The second most repeated command in the Bible,

581
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,040
 who'd get silver?

582
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,840
 Remember, remember, remember.

583
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,920
 This whole message.

584
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,120
 Remember who your heavenly father is.

585
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
 Remember God will provide for your needs.

586
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,920
 Over and over and over, he says, remember.

587
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,040
 Remember what he has done.

588
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,920
 Remember who your God is.

589
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,480
 Remember what he can do, what he will do.

590
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,280
 Remember his promises to you.

591
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,480
 Over and over, he says, remember,

592
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,840
 and he probably does because he knows

593
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,240
 we are people with very short attention spans.

594
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,280
 Even before this, we were joking

595
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,320
 that the iPhone has not helped.

596
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,520
 It's made our attention span like that of a goldfish,

597
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,120
 or even shorter than a goldfish.

598
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,000
 We're so quick to forget and to move on.

599
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,480
 It's hard to remember what I had for breakfast,

600
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,160
 let alone God's provision, his promise, who he is.

601
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,760
 He says, remember, I've got you.

602
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,720
 When you're feeling anxious, when you're feeling concerned,

603
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,800
 let the promise that I've given you,

604
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,600
 I will provide for your needs, wash over you.

605
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,240
 Not all of your wants, we're gonna talk about that

606
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,200
 in weeks ahead, everything you need, I got you.

607
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,720
 You can trust me.

608
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:35,680
 A promise that he most clearly kept on the cross.

609
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,520
 You know, the idea of a dog mom,

610
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,440
 and I'll close the plane or land here.

611
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,200
 The idea that Emily loves her dog,

612
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,440
 or the fact that God loves us more

613
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,080
 than Emily loves her dog,

614
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,680
 it's not really hard for me to believe that.

615
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,640
 I think that's true.

616
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
 It's pretty easy for me to be like,

617
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,160
 yeah, God clearly loves us more than she loves her dog,

618
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,200
 if she won't admit it.

619
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,720
 But the idea that God loves us more

620
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,800
 than any parent loves their child,

621
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,720
 that stretches my faith.

622
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,400
 I've got two kids.

623
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,080
 I can't even put into words how much I love my kids.

624
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,880
 The fact that God loves me more than I love my kids,

625
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,160
 like I wake up in the middle of the night,

626
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,880
 and I get sad thinking about how my,

627
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,600
 I got a four-year-old son, a two-year-old daughter,

628
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,280
 and they're at that stage in life,

629
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,840
 you don't even probably know what I'm talking about,

630
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,560
 their baby fat is just like disappearing.

631
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,080
 You're like, oh no, God, please don't let it go too fast.

632
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,880
 And I wake up thinking of just heartbroken over,

633
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,480
 there's gonna come a day I'm gonna be separated from them.

634
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,160
 If Jesus doesn't come back, one of us will die soon,

635
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,520
 or one of us will die before the other.

636
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,520
 All of which is for the point of, I love my kids so much,

637
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,120
 it's hard for me to imagine that God could love me, you,

638
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,800
 more, like it makes me irrational

639
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,120
 how much I love my kids sometimes.

640
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,240
 Like my wife came home recently from swim lessons

641
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,480
 for my son, who's four, who was going through it,

642
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,080
 and she began to explain as I asked her,

643
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,200
 like how did swim lessons go?

644
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
 He's trying to learn to swim.

645
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,720
 She was like, oh, it kind of went okay, didn't do great,

646
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
 like he didn't really like the drills,

647
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,320
 he didn't do great at 'em,

648
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,940
 wasn't as good as the other kids,

649
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,840
 and I just feel like he had a bad attitude

650
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,480
 because of that the whole time.

651
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,080
 I hear that, and a normal person would be like,

652
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,040
 oh, well, I'm sure I'll get 'em next time.

653
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,480
 As his father, because I so love him,

654
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,000
 like an irrational protectiveness snaps in on my head

655
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,200
 where I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, really?

656
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,280
 Really, swim lessons?

657
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,160
 That, hey, you're gonna do me like that, huh?

658
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,280
 Who do you think you are, swim lessons?

659
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,440
 We don't need you.

660
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,360
 We don't need to swim.

661
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,400
 We ain't living in an island somewhere.

662
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,620
 Why are we even doing swim lessons?

663
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,360
 If anybody's gonna mess with my, who,

664
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,820
 I'm gonna go find swim lessons right now.

665
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,200
 Right now I'm gonna find it.

666
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,280
 As though swim lessons is something like bully from school,

667
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,320
 but as his dad, it's hard not to.

668
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,100
 I love him so much.

669
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,480
 Snap into a protective mode that doesn't even make sense

670
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,880
 'cause I love him.

671
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,400
 And the Bible says there's no parent on the planet

672
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,780
 who loves their son or daughter more than God loves you.

673
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,400
 There's no husband who loves their wife

674
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
 more than God loves you.

675
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,680
 There's no wife who loves her husband

676
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,080
 more than God loves you.

677
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,600
 There's no person who loves their family member

678
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,360
 more than God loves you.

679
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,200
 He proved it.

680
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
 He's promised, I will provide for your needs.

681
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,560
 We're gonna talk in this series

682
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,400
 about a lot of different things related to anxiety,

683
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,860
 but you have to know if you're a believer, you can rest.

684
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
 God has promised you, listen to me.

685
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,760
 I got you.

686
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,440
 I will provide.

687
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,760
 I love you.

688
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,560
 I provided by giving my life for you

689
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,920
 and I will provide for your needs.

690
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,320
 Trust me.

691
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,180
 Remember.

692
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,160
 Let me pray.

693
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,120
 Father, I pray for anyone right now.

694
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,760
 And there are thousands

695
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,140
 who are hearing this and will hear this message

696
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,360
 who are anxious.

697
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,400
 They're afraid.

698
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,380
 Feels like they can't conquer it

699
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,820
 and they run back to it every single day.

700
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,380
 They're flooded with emotions and fear and their heart races.

701
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,340
 You would help them remember in those moments

702
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,580
 who their father is, your promise, your provision.

703
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,720
 You're in control.

704
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,740
 They can trust you.

705
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,460
 And that they would rest in that and they would trust you.

706
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,560
 I pray that you throughout this series

707
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,800
 would become bigger and more real

708
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,720
 than any fear or anything in their life.

709
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,960
 And you'd have all of us to trust you.

710
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,640
 The father who loves us, who made us,

711
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,560
 who wants more for us and more peace in our life

712
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,260
 than we even want for ourself.

713
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,440
 Help us to experience that.

714
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,440
 Pray for anyone who's never trusted in Jesus.

715
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,540
 This would be their night

716
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,680
 and they wouldn't just experience earthly peace,

717
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,160
 but eternal peace through being forgiven,

718
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,200
 which they can accept when they accept

719
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,240
 the work that you did on the cross in their place.

720
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,280
 We love you, in Christ's name, amen.

721
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:25,280
