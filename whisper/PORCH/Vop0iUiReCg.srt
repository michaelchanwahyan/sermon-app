1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 James is made up of 108 verses. 54 of them are imperatives. An imperative is a command.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:25,760
 That Jesus was not just his half-brother, he was his Lord. Let's go! Come on!

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,920
 Man, it is so fun to be back. It's been like a great restful season, but I have missed you guys

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,400
 and I'm so pumped to be back and I appreciate that. We are kicking off this series tonight

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:51,120
 and uh thanks mom and uh we're gonna start the book of James and if you're joining us in El Paso

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,400
 or Scottsdale for the first time, Indianapolis is kicking off. We've got several different

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,160
 Portslive locations, Austin, wherever you're joining from or if you're just tuning in online

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,640
 or everybody in the room, we are kicking off this series. We are so stinking pumped for what God is

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,800
 going to do both tonight and in this series. Let me start off by inviting you into my world a little

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,600
 bit. When I was growing up, I'm one of four kids. So I've got three siblings. I've got an older

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,080
 brother, older sister, younger brother. If you have siblings in the room, you know that whoever

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,560
 your sibling is has a direct impact on your growing up. You know they're kind of, especially

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,640
 if you're the younger or you're younger than one of them, the way that they blaze the trail through

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,520
 high school or the just you know bridges that they burn all the way through high school directly

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
 impacts, oh you're so-and-so's little brother, you're so-and-so's little brother. And because

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
 I was third, I had an older brother and an older sister. And a lot of people have an older brother

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,440
 where they're like man I just lived in his shadow, star quarterback. That was not my older brother.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,000
 My older brother was like I hit puberty at 20 and he was in the choir. So I didn't have that.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,280
 But I had an older sister who cast a shadow so big it would be hard to even describe,

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,440
 specifically as it related to sports. By far the most athletic person in our family was no one with

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,080
 a Y chromosome, it was her. She was a phenom at track and field. She ended up, oh they're already

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,840
 throwing a picture up there, there you go, all right let's do it. And she at 16 years old, I mean

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
 she was like a phenom, she won state, she had full-ride scholarships to almost every school in

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,720
 the country. She broke records, she in a huge high school, she broke records. So everywhere that I

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,720
 went it was, oh you're Angela Marvin's little brother, you guys can throw that down, you can

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,880
 keep it up. At 16 years old, like the entire town or at least that's kind of how I remember it in my

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,120
 mind, on a Friday night came out and there were so many people that were there to see her break

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,560
 the five-minute mile and run it in four minutes and change at a 16 year old. I mean she was just

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,120
 a phenom, she won state multiple times, she went on to Baylor, still holds lots of Baylor's records,

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,400
 won the Pan American Games in high school, she won the national championship her freshman year.

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
 I mean she's just like a huge shadow. So literally growing up in high school, everywhere that I went

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
 it was, oh you're Angela Marvin's little brother, oh this is Angela Marvin's little brother. Coaches

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,320
 would show up from all every major STC school, every school in the country show up and oh

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,680
 you're Angela's little brother. And this huge shadow was cast of being in the shadow of this

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,600
 sibling that everybody in town knew. Now what does that have to do with James? Well James, if you're

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,640
 not familiar with it, he lived and grew up in an environment where he also experienced an enormous

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,680
 shadow that would have been cast because of one of his siblings. His sibling was not just famous,

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,600
 you know, in the town that they grew up in, his sibling was the most famous person who's ever

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,040
 lived because his sibling was Jesus. Now Jesus had half brothers, one of them was a guy by the name

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,880
 of James who didn't always believe in Jesus but he eventually did and he wrote the book of James.

41
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,000
 But what we're going to do as we journey through the book James is hear from someone who spent

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,520
 time with you. I mean think about it, if you could spend time with with Michael Jordan's best friend

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,320
 or his brother growing up what that would have been like. We're about to hear from the half brother

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,680
 because they didn't share the same dad, had the same mom, the half brother of the most influential

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,880
 person of all time. The guy who grew up when they went on like, you know, we're going on vacation,

46
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,400
 we're taking the camels, going to see the cousins. There's James, there's Jesus. The guy who shared a,

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,160
 likely shared a room with Jesus because houses back then was like one room so everybody shared

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
 a room. The guy who would have, you know, he's at Jesus's bat mitzvah whenever they're like, oh yeah,

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,720
 party, yeah let's do this. James is there for all of that, every interaction, every scenario.

50
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
 I mean think about even the pressure that would have come. I don't know, you know, what your

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
 siblings are like but maybe you have like somebody who was like, dude, this, they're just, they never

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,680
 do anything wrong. How much pressure would James have felt when he's like stealing cookies from the

53
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,440
 cookie jar and he's like, I didn't do it, somebody else did it and Jesus is like, I know all things,

54
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,040
 James. I know that you stole the cookie. Or he's out there like macking on some girl at school

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
 and like, what's up shorty, how you doing? And Jesus is like, James, I thought we talked about this.

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:59,040
 I mean how much pressure would it be to grow up in that type of shadow? And James, like I said,

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,920
 although he didn't always believe and I'll cover that here in a second, he eventually came to

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:09,280
 believe. He's not just my brother, he's the Messiah and he writes the earliest piece of the

59
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,600
 New Testament. The letter that we're about to jump into, a little context, is written by James,

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,280
 I already covered that. He wrote to Christian spread all throughout the Roman Empire, basically

61
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 all throughout the world and he wrote the earliest letter in about 45 AD, which is about 15 years

62
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,280
 or 10 years after Jesus was resurrected and went back to heaven. And James writes this letter and

63
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,800
 he writes to Christians who are trying to figure out how do I live out my faith and I'm walking

64
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
 through and people are attacking me for my faith and the world around me just doesn't really like

65
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,800
 Christians. How do I live this out? And James writes and he covers the topic we're going to

66
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
 dive in tonight. That's the first of really 14 different topics. We won't cover, you know,

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,360
 all of them every single night, but he launches in and he begins to cover this topic. We need to

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
 know about James as you track through and I really want to encourage you, if you're new to reading

69
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,640
 the Bible or you've been reading it for a long time, to journey with us through this book. We're

70
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,760
 going to go through every single verse. We're going to try to unpack and help as we do explain how to

71
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,200
 study the Bible. It's one of the most common questions we get. Man, how do I study? Come to

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,040
 the ports. I feel like I can understand it there, but I'm by myself. We're going to walk through and

73
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,560
 just explain and hopefully give handholds on how to practically and personally you to journey with

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,160
 us. We're even going to have some resources in a couple weeks that we'll be releasing, but we're

75
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,840
 going to journey through and listen to the whole truth from the half-brother of the Son of God.

76
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,480
 Tonight we're going to cover a topic that is as relevant as it's ever been, and it's the topic

77
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,160
 that James starts with, which is trials. When life throws something at you that you didn't ask for,

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,200
 that you didn't invite, that you don't even necessarily want there. Whether it's sickness

79
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,720
 of someone in your life, could be a breakup, big and small. Your latte wasn't the right

80
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,360
 temperature when it came out, or you found out someone in your family is sick, like really sick.

81
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
 You lost the job that you would just banked everything. You thought this for sure is going

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,560
 to be good, and it didn't happen. You got let go for reasons you don't even fully understand.

83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,400
 The relationship that you thought, "Oh, this was, they were the one."

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:10,720
 Now there's just someone, and it broke off, and it broke part of you. What do you do in those trials?

85
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,000
 So tonight we're going to journey as James launches in, because trials and pain,

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
 difficult things have been around for a long time, and God wants to use those things. So tonight

87
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,640
 we're going to talk about what is the point of trials? What is God doing in the midst of them?

88
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,200
 And three things really just to know about in the midst of this. So we're going to start in verse 1,

89
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,520
 chapter 1 of James. If you have a Bible, you can flip over there. If not, it'll be up on the screen.

90
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,960
 If you don't have a Bible, you can get one at the Welcome Center. If you're here in Dallas,

91
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,680
 and you have a free gift, we've got some available there for you. But we're going to start in verse 1,

92
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
 chapter 1.

93
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:51,360
 He introduced himself.

94
00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:02,320
 So Jewish Christians spread all across the nations.

95
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,320
 Greetings. James, unlike other writers in the New Testament, Paul gives a long intro.

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,080
 "Hey, this is me. This is all. I'm excited. This is going to be so great." Lots of intro.

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,040
 James doesn't do that. No fluff kind of guy. Dives right in. Says this.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,760
 "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,

99
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:32,560
 because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance, or the ability to continue

100
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:41,200
 going, or enduring faith. And let perseverance finish its work, so that you may be complete,

101
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,040
 or mature and complete, not lacking anything." Immediately he starts with something that's very

102
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,680
 counterintuitive and very not natural for us. He says, "Hey, I want you, whenever you face trials,

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,600
 to consider it joy." Why would you say consider it joy, James? Whenever things are falling apart

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,640
 and life's not going on, who in the world considers that joy? That's not normal. Like,

105
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
 how could he say such a thing? Is it because he's just, you know, glutton for punishment? Hit me

106
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:15,280
 again. No. Because in the verse he tells us, there's a reason why in the midst of difficulty,

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,160
 hardship, things that for the rest of your life are going to come at you. Unlike most people,

108
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
 or many people, or some people, in the midst of the trial, the cancer comes back, something just

109
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,440
 never thought could happen to you happens. And they begin to walk away and they step away.

110
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
 James says, "No, no, no, no, no. In the midst of every trial, you can have joy, because there is

111
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,160
 a potential in the midst of that trial for God to use it to bring about good." Specifically,

112
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,880
 he says, "It can produce something in your life." Every hardship, every breakup, every painful season

113
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,680
 of singleness, every disappointment is an opportunity where God wants to use that to

114
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,280
 produce something. What does it produce? He says, "A persevering faith, an enduring faith." And that

115
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,200
 is the thing that brings about a maturity inside of your life. That God uses that to mature you

116
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,360
 and I in the midst of difficult things. The first idea is the potential of trials, which is it has

117
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,480
 the potential in every trial that you face. It can either be one, you hold on, you don't lose your

118
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,920
 faith. You say, "God, I'm going to trust you. I'm going to walk through this. I'm going to cling to

119
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,600
 you imperfectly." And when you do that, James said, "God begins to develop an enduring faith that

120
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:28,320
 doesn't stop. It keeps going." And that is how someone matures, grows. One of the ways that God

121
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,680
 uses trials is just like at a gym when you put strain on your muscle. The only way for you to get

122
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,920
 stronger, more in shape, is to go through pain. But it's a pain that has a potential to take you

123
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,960
 somewhere. And James says, "Distinct from many other things." If you want to be someone who's

124
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,960
 mature in their faith, who's steadfast, who doesn't walk away, who doesn't fall away, it's going to

125
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,000
 involve trials. Sometimes trials that you cause, others cause. No one wanted, God allowed,

126
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
 and he's saying if you will hold on to your faith in the midst of that,

127
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,280
 God will use that to bring and mature you and mature me. Unlike other things, what do I mean by

128
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,400
 that? You can read a bunch of Bible verses this week. You read the whole New Testament. Is that

129
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,360
 going to make you mature? No. That's going to make you smarter. You could obey every verse in the New

130
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,920
 Testament this week. Is that going to make you more mature? Nope. That'll make you obedient,

131
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,680
 distinct from many other things. What is the path towards being mature, growing up in your faith?

132
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,040
 It involves trials and walking through them. And James says, "When they come," and this is so

133
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,960
 relevant because I've just heard it story after story after story for the last 12 years of doing

134
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,800
 this, where people, and you've heard it, you've heard people in the midst of, they walked away

135
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,840
 from their faith and now they're trying to come back to it, but at some point in their age their

136
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:57,520
 parents divorced. Their mom got sick and she never came back. Things seemed to just spiral out of

137
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,240
 control and they found themselves going, "I don't even know if I believe this anymore." For one

138
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:09,200
 reason or another, they just walked away. And you know what I've never heard to the person who says,

139
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,720
 "You know, I'm just walking away because it's trial, so I'm stepping away from my faith." I've

140
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,080
 never heard the person who does that, years down the road or even months down the road, say, "You

141
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,560
 know what? I was following God and then I got news that I just couldn't handle. Things just didn't

142
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,360
 seem to be going the way that I wanted, so I was like, 'You know what? I'm out on this. I'm not

143
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
 doing this anymore.'" And they walked away. And you know what happened? Everything in my life got

144
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,080
 better. I walked away from God. My relationships got better. My self-control got better. My

145
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:45,280
 happiness got better. Anxiety went away. Never heard it. I've heard hundreds, if not thousands,

146
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,600
 who said, "Man, I let that trial push me away from God. And it also pushed me away when that

147
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:01,920
 happened, from peace, from joy, into addiction, into depression." And James says, "Trials are

148
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,560
 going to come." Notice he doesn't say if they come. He says when they come. But there's potential

149
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,320
 because God wants to use it to grow and mature your character. There's a famous story about

150
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,840
 Michelangelo. Michelangelo was an artist in the 1500s. He created many famous works. One of the

151
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,840
 most famous ones was a statue called the Statue of David. He took this single block of marble,

152
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,960
 huge block of marble, and out of it, at a time where there was no machinery, there's no electricity,

153
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,720
 there's nothing fancy, he took it in a single hammer and a chisel and he chiseled away and he

154
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,440
 created the Statue of David. It was a marvel. He had an interview or a conversation with somebody

155
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 where they asked him, "How were you able to make such an incredible thing?" I mean, today we could

156
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,640
 do this because we have, you know, all types of machinery that could do it. But just with a hammer

157
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,280
 and a chisel, he was able to produce that. His answer to, "How was I able to do that?" is just,

158
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,560
 it was simple. I chipped away everything that didn't look like David.

159
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,600
 In the same way, trials is one of the hammer and chisels that God will take in our life

160
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,800
 and he'll allow to chip away and conform everything in your life and in my life that doesn't look like

161
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,440
 Jesus. That's what the Bible calls sanctification. What's sanctification? It's what trials do. It's

162
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,560
 what the Christian life is. It's a word that means becoming more like Jesus. One of the ways that

163
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,760
 that happens is through the hammer and chisel of trials in our life where God will chip away. How

164
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,240
 does he chip away? I mean, you think about it. You know what happens in trial? A lot of the ways that

165
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,960
 I'm finding my identity and how much I make and the job that I have, I lose that job, I'm confronted

166
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,800
 with the fact that I don't even know who I am because I don't have that anymore. I find my

167
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,880
 identity or I find myself and I find my confidence in how I look and all of a sudden, man, I got hit

168
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,960
 with an autoimmune disease. I can't, I'm not going to look the way that I wanted to look and I'm

169
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,360
 confronted with the fact that, man, I put too much stake in what other people think about how I look.

170
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,600
 Trials come and people will turn and discover like, oh man, I'm really coping with something

171
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,600
 in an unhealthy way, whether it's marijuana, whether it's a bottle, maybe it's just dysfunctional

172
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:12,480
 relationships. And God in the midst of those trials said, don't let go, don't abandon, hold on.

173
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,640
 And in doing so, he's going to chip away at everything that doesn't look

174
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,600
 like Jesus in your life and in my life.

175
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:31,200
 It's through pain that we often grow healthier. In other words, some of the most painful times

176
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,360
 are the things that bring about health. My son on a Tuesday night, a couple years ago at this point,

177
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,560
 my wife called me and it was a Tuesday. I wasn't teaching, but I was in the green room. I was

178
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,680
 hanging out. I've got a three-year-old son. And at that point, like a one-year-old daughter,

179
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,880
 she calls me and says, hey, our son's finger just got slammed in the car door and his nail is

180
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,880
 completely off and his finger is messed up. I've got to take him to the emergency room.

181
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,320
 So it wasn't one of those situations that I could be like, all right, go get him, champ. I was like,

182
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,000
 all right, tell me where to go. I'll see, I'll meet you there. I'm not teaching, so I'll join

183
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,280
 him. We go to the hospital and in my mind, I'm already here, I'm going. In my mind, I was like,

184
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,520
 his finger is falling off. Okay. All right, drama mama, let's go. And just not knowing what to

185
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,680
 expect. And then I get to the hospital and I see, and it was like his entire nail, his thumbnail

186
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,160
 was like totally off of it. And as a three-year-old, you're like freaking out and just,

187
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
 you're already, as I've said before, tears are already on standby. So it's just like

188
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,880
 constantly. Doctor comes in, he evaluates it, says, Hey, can I talk to you for a second? And he

189
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,560
 says, we're going to have to stitch that entire thing up. And in order for us to fix, you know,

190
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,960
 and put back together his thumb, I'm going to have to stick a needle into a thumb, which is

191
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,920
 not pleasant for anybody, let alone somebody who's, you know, 36 months old. And if I'm going

192
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,520
 to do that, I need you to hold him down. And so I had to sit there and hold a three-year-old who

193
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,840
 couldn't understand anything, who is negotiating like, I don't even need the thumb. I don't even

194
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,160
 want the thumb. I'm really fine. Please stop the needle, please. And I'm having to hold down his

195
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,360
 arm. It's so heartbreaking and hold down his arm and allow some pain to take place so that his

196
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:18,240
 thumb could heal. And in the same way, it's often through painful moments that healing, growth,

197
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:25,600
 and maturing happen distinct from all other categories. And God wants to bring that about

198
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,720
 to refine you and I's faith. I love, again, like he said, it's not if you face trials,

199
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,200
 it is when they are coming. Jesus said in John chapter 16, verse 33, in this world, you will

200
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,400
 have trouble, but take heart. I've overcome the world. There's going to come a day. I'm going to

201
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,640
 make everything new, but from now till then, there's going to be pandemics. There's going

202
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,480
 to be breakups. There's going to be divorce. There's going to be tremendous pain. It's not if,

203
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,160
 it's when. This is why the prosperity gospel is so crazy to me. The prosperity gospel,

204
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,240
 if you're not familiar, is this teaching that, you know, millions of people buy into that pastors

205
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,240
 in positions like this say things that are not biblical where they're like, if you follow God,

206
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,080
 this year, everything that you need in life is going to go well. You're going to be wealthier.

207
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,880
 You're going to be healthier. You're going to be speltier. It's going to be great.

208
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,760
 And people buy into it by the millions. Some of the most significant influential pastors in America

209
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,280
 preach this nonsense. That's a not biblical idea of what Jesus said. It's going to be rough.

210
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,760
 You're going to walk through the valley of the shadow of death over and over and over. Everybody's

211
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,880
 going to die. Everyone, the death toll still at a hundred percent. No one's escaped it other than

212
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,680
 Jesus. And that man said, you are going to face trouble. You won't always get the job. You won't

213
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,280
 always be healthy. Your spouse is going to die. Think about even the pain represented in the

214
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,520
 futures of this room. Like if we could look down in a moment and go through everything that's in

215
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,040
 front of you, hundreds, if not thousands of you will die of cancer or your wife will, or your

216
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,200
 husband will. Some of you will never be able to have children because infertility is a thing.

217
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,040
 Some of you are going to bury your child. There is tremendous pain that's represented even in the

218
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,960
 future and certainly in the past here. And anyone who promises, if you just read enough Bible,

219
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,640
 that's not going to happen, is a liar. And they don't teach the Bible. The Bible says pain is

220
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,800
 coming. And James says, not if it comes, when it comes, you need to be ready. And my heart tonight

221
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,440
 is to say, you need to be, and I need to be ready. It's going to come. Don't let go. Don't walk away.

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,120
 Lean in. There's a difference. If I was to come up to you, and if you know that something is coming,

223
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,280
 it makes it a lot easier to be able to handle it and take it than if you don't. In other words,

224
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,200
 if I was to take one of these guys that looks pretty bowed up up here, and I was like, all right,

225
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,560
 hey, come up and say, let me pump you, punch you in the stomach. You'd probably be like, all right,

226
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,720
 dude, you look like you're not going to throw in that hard. I'll take it. And I punch you in the

227
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,320
 stomach and you're ready for it. All right. Thank you, sir. May I have another? If I was to walk up

228
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,280
 when you're talking to your girl outside, I was like, boom, as I walk by, you're not going to be

229
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,200
 able to breathe because you weren't bracing yourself because you didn't know what's coming.

230
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:19,680
 James is saying, it's coming. You need to know that and be ready. And if that makes you anxious,

231
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:26,960
 you're on planet earth. So I'm just telling you reality. But in the midst of that storm,

232
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,360
 you and I have a hope as followers of Jesus, we get to hold onto knowing there's a heavenly father

233
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,400
 who's going to allow that to be a potential to use even the most painful moments to work for

234
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:44,320
 good in our life. Some of you, the pain in your past and the stories, it may be even the opposite.

235
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,440
 You just, you've walked through pain. And one of the ways God used it and grew you and matured you

236
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,880
 was he gave you a great example of what not to do. You were raised in an abusive home.

237
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,680
 Your parents had a terrible marriage. And even that can be a thing that he uses to say, man,

238
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,000
 I'm going to show you by seeing the example of what not to do, what you're going to do.

239
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,520
 That's the story that I have. I grew up in a broken home, parents divorced, didn't ever see

240
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,440
 godly marriage modeled out and learned a lot of what it looks like to be a dad, but even what not

241
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,480
 to do. I don't know your exact story in the specifics, but I do know that in every trial

242
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,360
 and every pain, there's potential that God wants to use to mature and to bring about good in your

243
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:28,960
 life and my life. And James says, not only in every trial can there be potential to produce enduring

244
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,600
 faith and maturity, but he then goes on to what to do in the midst of a trial. You just,

245
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,360
 you can't connect the dots on what God's doing. He says this, if any of you lacks wisdom,

246
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,560
 let me stop right there. Think about that sentence.

247
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,240
 If any of you lacks wisdom, it's like saying, if anyone needs oxygen, it's like, wait,

248
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,240
 if any of you likes, if anybody, does anybody not lack wisdom in this room? And if you raise

249
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,880
 your hand, you are the person who for sure lacks wisdom because you're so not wise. You don't even

250
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,200
 know that you don't lack wisdom. I mean, that applies to everybody. He says in the midst,

251
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,160
 he's going somewhere, he's connecting it to this idea of trial. He says, if you lack wisdom,

252
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,160
 you should ask God who gives, I love this, who gives generously to all.

253
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:24,320
 He gives generously to all of his children. Without finding fault, he doesn't hold to the

254
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,880
 person who's walking through a trial and in pain, and they don't know what to do. They can't connect

255
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,320
 the dots on what God is doing in the world. And they're just having a tough time. And they go to

256
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,560
 God and they ask him and they haven't had their quiet time. They messed up with their boyfriend.

257
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,680
 To that person, does God hold it against him? Nope. He gives generously. Like when I was reading

258
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,080
 this text, I just got this image. This is probably weird and TMI, but of like a grandpa that's

259
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,240
 handing out ice cream that just goes on and on. It just gives generously two scoops, seven scoops,

260
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,080
 or Oprah, you get a car and you get a car and you get a car. And James says, that's what your

261
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,280
 heavenly father's like. Gives generously to all without finding fault who ask him. But when you

262
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,040
 ask, you must believe, believe that God is good, that he loves you. He's at work and not doubt.

263
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:13,840
 Because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea. He's blown and tossed by the wind.

264
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,320
 That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. The person is double-minded and

265
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,640
 unstable in all that they do. He incorporates an analogy that really fits where he brings up

266
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,560
 the topic of a storm. And so you have a storm and the wind and the wave and things blowing back

267
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,720
 and forth. And in the midst of the storm, James says, as you walk through trials, you need to know

268
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,680
 there's going to come times where you cannot connect the dots. That's what wisdom is. Wisdom,

269
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,480
 biblically, the definition of wisdom is the ability to see things from a bigger perspective,

270
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,240
 from a heavenly perspective. That's what wisdom is in general. I mean, when we talk about, you know,

271
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,080
 the reason we associate older people with wise people is because we assume, "You've lived a lot

272
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,600
 of years. You probably have been through something like this before. You have a bigger vantage point

273
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,000
 than I am." The reason you're wiser than a 12-year-old is because you've been down the road

274
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,760
 and you're like, "Yeah, man, I know how this ends." Junior high, those zits are going away.

275
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,800
 It's going to be okay. You have a higher perspective. Wisdom in general, and biblical

276
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,760
 understanding of wisdom, is the ability to see life through a heavenly perspective. To see the

277
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,960
 trials, to see singleness, to see breakups, to see disappointments through a heavenly perspective,

278
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,240
 higher perspective, and in light of that, live life. And James says, if you're in the moment

279
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,960
 where you can't connect the dots, then how could God be using this? In the midst of those storms,

280
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,000
 we begin to ask questions. "Where are you, God? Why would you allow this? How are you doing this?

281
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,280
 What am I supposed to do now?" And he says, "When you're in those places, you should go to your

282
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,040
 heavenly Father, who gives generously, providing wisdom to those who ask." The second idea from

283
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,560
 the text is the prescription for trials. The prescription, James says, in the midst of the

284
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,400
 trials, is to go to God in prayer and ask for wisdom, for help. Talk to God. Don't turn to

285
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,360
 self-help, turn to God-help. The self-help industry is insane. You can't help yourself,

286
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,640
 but God can. In other words, if you could help yourself, you already would have helped yourself.

287
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,040
 That's why there's an endless list of on and on and on self-help books that are top sellers every

288
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,680
 single year, because people keep putting out like, "Oh, you can, you can, you can." And yet there's

289
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,160
 no like one fix, like, "Oh, this one actually worked." Because you and I can't help ourself.

290
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,120
 You may be able to like moderate changes and get on a keto diet, but in terms of actual

291
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:33,600
 peace and walking through trials, walking through life, you don't need self-help. You and I need

292
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,360
 God-help. And James, I love this, he says, "You have a heavenly Father who gives generously. He

293
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,360
 loves you." He said, "Call out to Him. Talk to Him." He wants to generously give in response to that.

294
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,920
 One of the things that having kids has like grown in me or really showed me is how God's love for me

295
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,320
 and for those of us who are followers of Christ, who are called adopted, like sons and daughters,

296
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,920
 His love for me is something I don't know that I even have begun to understand.

297
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,800
 Why do I say that? Because as someone who has kids, like the amount that I love my children,

298
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,480
 I don't even know how to describe it in words. And like the things that I would do and the things

299
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,640
 that I would do and just the ways that I just care about them and I'm concerned about them,

300
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,520
 I would do anything. What they care about, I care about. I can't even describe it. Like I have a

301
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,680
 two-year-old daughter whose name is Monroe, and she is just like the best. We call her the joker

302
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,680
 because she's constantly laughing and making jokes, and she's just like out of control and

303
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,320
 probably going to be really concerning someday with boys. But she got this game recently for

304
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 dropping her pacifier, and it's called Pretty Pretty Princess. I've never heard of this game

305
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
 before. Who's heard of this game before? Anybody? Girls? Pretty Pretty Princess? Or as she would

306
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,280
 call, because she can't do her R's, you want to play Pretty Pretty Princess? And it's just like

307
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,360
 the best, man. I'm like, please, please do this for the rest of your life. And I'll give you the

308
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,160
 game, guys, because I didn't know what the game was until we got the game. And it's a game where

309
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,160
 it's like this board, and you spin it, and you get a piece, and there's all these jewelry pieces,

310
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,600
 and each person has a color. So you've got blue and pink and green. This is going somewhere,

311
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,880
 too, by the way. And you spin it, and if you land on the earring, you get the earring. If you land

312
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,960
 on the necklace, you get the necklace. So by the end of the game, you're like, you're decked out

313
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,480
 like plastic jewelry. And I'm just glad there's no pictures out there or anything. But I'll sit

314
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,480
 there, and she constantly wants to play. And I would say this, you know, very, very confidently.

315
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,480
 Prior to having kids, I can say going 30 years of my life, there was never a moment where I was

316
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,320
 like, you know what I could really go for right now? Some pretty, pretty princess. And that just

317
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,200
 never crossed my mind, never had a thought. It's not really the most exciting game. But I could

318
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,320
 sit there and play with her for hours on it because of how much she loves it. In the same way,

319
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,360
 the picture the Bible gives of your heavenly Father, because I know there's a lot of people

320
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,440
 who didn't have a good father around, maybe in one of them. It's a father who loves you so much.

321
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,880
 He doesn't just want to play a board game with you. He wants to spend time with you. He wants

322
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,560
 to call, or he wants you to call out to him and help. He wants you to know how much he loves you.

323
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,280
 And he said, no matter what you're walking through, you can turn to me. You can invite me for help.

324
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,080
 And I give generously to my kids. You need to know that. And James would say, call out to your father

325
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,680
 as you're walking through a trial. Ask him for help. Ask him for wisdom. As I said, wisdom is

326
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,360
 the ability to see things from a higher, more eternal perspective. Because a lot of times,

327
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,240
 we just can't connect the dots between, man, what are you doing, God? How does this fit into your

328
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,200
 plan? He promised in Romans chapter 8 and Ephesians, or Ecclesiastes chapter 3,

329
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,560
 verse 11, he's working all things together for good, and he will make everything beautiful in

330
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:09,120
 its time. That verse is shocking to me. I will make everything beautiful in its time.

331
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,640
 Someone dying from a drunk driving accident, beautiful.

332
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:23,760
 Someone you know experiencing sexual abuse, beautiful. Someone dying of cancer in their 20s,

333
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,160
 beautiful. There's a lot of things that I look at, I'm like, I don't know how you're going to do that.

334
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:38,720
 My wife, we, another thing that happens when you get married, you get rugs.

335
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:47,280
 And, man, you just, you probably should know this, like, there's something about women and rugs.

336
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,680
 I didn't know. And like every three months, I'll come home and my wife will have like a new rug

337
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,280
 out. She's like, it was on Facebook Marketplace. I sold the other one and I got this one. It looks

338
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,040
 so great. Just feels so fresh. Just feels so clean. And I'm like, man, huh, never would have gotten

339
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,720
 that. So I feel like I have boughten so many rugs in my life. And, man, you should just know,

340
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,840
 when you get married, you are going to be investing in some rugs.

341
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:22,160
 You know what's interesting about a rug? There's one side where everything is vibrant and beautiful

342
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:32,400
 and purposeful, like the work of someone who's making a beautiful tapestry.

343
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,840
 And then if you flip open the rug, especially depending on the rug that you have,

344
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,800
 you see another side where there's frayed edges and things sticking out and it's dull colors,

345
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,040
 and it just doesn't look like anything beautiful.

346
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,160
 I think a lot of times in life, the reason why it looks that way for us is because it is that way.

347
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,320
 And we can't always connect that out. So we can't always see it until you see it from the other side.

348
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,720
 And there will come a day when God says, man, I promise I'm making everything beautiful on this

349
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,720
 time. And one day you're going to see, and I know it looks like frayed edges. I know it looks dull.

350
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,920
 I know it looks like, how could this possibly be used for good? But even more incredible at making,

351
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,200
 or incredible in someone who makes rugs, I am weaving together a tapestry

352
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,800
 and using even the broken things for good. And I'm inviting you to ask me for wisdom,

353
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,960
 to see it from the other side, to see it from a heavenly perspective.

354
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,680
 When you're walking through those moments and trials, to not let them push you away from me,

355
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:42,880
 push you towards me, and ask me for help. And James says, when you walk through, you need to know

356
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,000
 God has invited you and he gives generously to those who ask him.

357
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,440
 If you're walking through your trials and I just want to encourage you,

358
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,240
 before you leave, just to invite God, maybe you're in the last song, God, will you help me?

359
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,720
 I'm struggling. How can this make sense? Maybe it's a breakup. Breakups are freaking horrible.

360
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:11,520
 Maybe it's somebody who's really sick in the hospital from COVID. Maybe it's something

361
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,040
 much smaller, something far greater. I don't know what it is, but to just say, God,

362
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,240
 will you help me connect the dots? I'm inviting you. Would you give me wisdom to handle this

363
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,320
 situation? Would you help me right now? Would you take away the cancer? And if you don't,

364
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,920
 would you help me to connect the dots? Because I feel like this is a frayed edge and I don't

365
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:33,840
 want this to drive me from you. Will you help me? And that's a prayer. James says,

366
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,880
 "Man, I know my big brother." That's a prayer his father loves to answer.

367
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,680
 Finally, I'm just saying, hey, every trial there's potential. In every trial, here's a

368
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,360
 prescription. It's called prayer. He then goes into and finishes a promise about trials. It's

369
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,480
 the third idea. Believers in humble circumstances, that's poor. Your translation may have poor.

370
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,120
 They ought to take pride in their high position. But if you're poor, then you have a high position.

371
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,760
 But the rich should take pride in their humiliation or their low position.

372
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,480
 Since they will pass away like a wildflower. He's talking about both of them.

373
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,080
 The sun rises in the scorching heat and withers the plant and its blossom fails or falls and its

374
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,320
 beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their

375
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,720
 business. Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because having stood the test of time,

376
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,160
 that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.

377
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,480
 James, what are you saying? He just laid out, hey, every person who's poor should take pride

378
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,400
 in their high position. That God has allowed them to live this life struggling and walking

379
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,560
 through the trial of being poor. Every person who's rich should take pride in their low position

380
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,360
 because God hasn't given them the gift of walking through these challenging times. What are you

381
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,960
 trying to say, James? He's saying poverty is going away, riches are going away, trials are going away.

382
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,480
 And the person who thinks that in that day and age that would have that wealth would have meant

383
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,720
 that God is blessing me and that I'm, you know, forever I'm protected from those things. And James

384
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,120
 is going, you're not protected from anything. Riches are going away. This life is a vapor. James

385
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,880
 is going to say later in the same book, the Psalms call, again, life being a vapor. What's a vapor?

386
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,120
 A few weeks ago, snowmageddon, you go outside, you breathe out, and you could see your breath

387
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,360
 forming right there. Instantly it's gone away. That's what the Bible says your life is. You're

388
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,880
 going to spend millions and billions and billions of years in eternity. This life is a vapor compared

389
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,880
 to that. And James says, dude, the minute you die, if you're a follower of Jesus, if you're poor,

390
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,320
 you're richer than you will ever be. If you're rich in this life, you're infinitely richer than

391
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,960
 you've ever been. And this life is going to fade away. It's temporary. Keep going. Don't let go.

392
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,200
 Blessed is the one who holds fast in the midst of the trial. The one who will receive the crown

393
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,080
 of life. Don't let go. And the promise of trials is that they are temporary. They're going away

394
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:08,800
 and they will not remain forever. Don't lose heart. Don't let go. Suffering won't last. And one day,

395
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,840
 everything broken in our world, Revelation chapter 22 said, will be made right. And if you're a

396
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,000
 Christian, the good news is this is as bad as we'll ever get. I don't know if your life right

397
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
 now, you're like, dude, everything's great. Kind of like hurting my vibes right now, or everything

398
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,440
 in your world is terrible. The good news is if you're a follower of Jesus, this is your hell.

399
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:37,280
 It will never get any worse. Only up from here. If you're not a follower of Jesus, this is your heaven.

400
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,000
 It's only going to get worse.

401
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,960
 And it won't get worse because God doesn't love you. He loved you so much,

402
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,880
 he died on the cross for you. You. Whatever you think you've done, whatever like you're like,

403
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,560
 oh man, this is kind of good. I kind of like this. I need to really get right with God some more.

404
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,440
 But I don't think I could go to heaven. You can because God on the cross paid for your sins.

405
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,760
 The message of Christianity is not good people go to heaven. You really need to try harder. Why

406
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,000
 didn't you read your Bible yesterday? I don't think, God knows about the fact that you smoke

407
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,240
 outside of the school that one day with Beverly. That stuff doesn't matter. He knows all that.

408
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,640
 He knows everything that you think would keep you out of having a relationship with God. And he died

409
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,880
 for all of it in your life and in my life and in every life that's in this room. He's a God who

410
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,120
 said every sin you've ever committed. I died for sins you don't even know you're going to commit

411
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,880
 this Thursday. Paid for. Not because of how good you are or how much you've done or you trying to

412
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,280
 follow him or do good things. That will never earn you a relationship with God. Accepting the free

413
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:49,760
 gift of Jesus on the cross dying for you. Jesus I receive. I believe. The Bible says whosoever

414
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,560
 believes will not perish but have eternal life. Whoever believes in Jesus you paid for me. Not

415
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,200
 whoever behaves for Jesus. Whoever believes. And if you've never had a moment where you've said

416
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:08,720
 I don't think I'm good enough to earn God's love. I'll never get there. You won't. You'll never get

417
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:17,200
 there. But you can accept what he did for you and for me on the cross dying. God I accept that. I'm

418
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,040
 not I don't know fully how to do that but I'm going to trust in what you did for me on the cross.

419
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,560
 You'll have eternal life and this world is your hell but if you don't this world is your heaven.

420
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,880
 And James says to those who are believers hold on. If you're rich you're poor the trial's going to

421
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,120
 weigh whatever you're walking through right now it's on a shot clock. Whatever hardship you're

422
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,960
 facing whatever pain you're feeling whatever sadness you're holding it's not going to last.

423
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:55,840
 Don't let go. It's coming to an end. And while it's here God will use them in your life and in

424
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:03,440
 my life. There's a famous woman who's an evangelist or she just has a large ministry named Joni

425
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,720
 Erickson-Totta. Joni when she was 17 years old was swimming at the friends with some lake or swimming

426
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:15,920
 at the lake with some friends. And while she's there you know they're all diving in the lake

427
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,120
 and she did what all of many of us probably have done hundreds of times which she ran and she

428
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:26,880
 jumped in the lake headfirst. Only the spot that she dove into there was a cement pillar and she

429
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:39,760
 broke her neck and she was paralyzed from that day to now in the 1970s. And that terrible trial

430
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,600
 pushed her into the arms of Jesus and she's traveled all over the world and she's just

431
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,680
 spoken about how despite the fact that I'm in this and I'm a quadriplegic I can't move my arms

432
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,320
 can't move my feet I can't move anything but above my neck God is good and he's used it and I trust

433
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,280
 him. So powerful. Larry King who passed away in January had a show for years and years and on

434
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,280
 there one time he interviewed Joni Erickson-Totta and he was just kind of amazed with her and

435
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,640
 fascinated by how someone could be so professing and yet not profess like hey if you believe Jesus

436
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,800
 enough he'll let you get up and walk but I believe Jesus so much and whether I walk or not and he was

437
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,600
 just kind of perplexed by that and he had her on and he interviewed her and at one point he asked

438
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,200
 her are you excited to get to heaven and one day be able to walk and here's what she responded with

439
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,000
 if I could take this wheelchair to heaven with me standing next to my savior Jesus Christ

440
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,160
 I would say Lord do you see this wheelchair?

441
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,800
 You were right when you said that in this world we would have trouble and there's a lot of trouble

442
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:53,600
 being a quadriplegic but you know what the weaker I was in that thing the harder I leaned on you

443
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:04,640
 and the harder I leaned on you the stronger I discovered you to be. Thank you for the bruising

444
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:15,760
 blessing it was for this severe mercy. Thank you. I think a lot of us would say I want to feel closer

445
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:25,040
 to God. I know I would and I want to be more like Jesus but if someone asked do you want to suffer

446
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:35,120
 more? I think I'd say not if I can avoid it and they would say those are the same questions.

447
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:43,920
 It's one of the routes that God grows us. We find him most near. He's in the midst of trial and

448
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,360
 suffering and James is saying don't lose heart it's gonna be worth it. We close with this and

449
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,320
 then wrap up about James. One thing that's like fascinating to me is the fact that women have

450
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:05,760
 more than one child and as curveball as that sounds like that's so painful and the fact that

451
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,080
 they go all the way through that like I you know my wife clearly has carried the heavy lifting as

452
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,960
 it relates to birthing and I still I'm like oh man oh there's a friend of mine who's an elder

453
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,520
 on staff named Mickey who says that women are men are stronger but women are tougher. I think that's

454
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:27,440
 so true. Men may be physically stronger in general and somebody's that's gonna be the one comment

455
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,720
 somebody comes up with like look I've gone bodybuilding four different times and women are

456
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,440
 tougher and I think that's so true as childbirth that there's something about just an amazing gift

457
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,680
 of moms where they're like man even though I went through all that pain it's worth it. It's worth it

458
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,280
 because now I have this child on the other side and the same thing I'm like I would do it again

459
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,000
 and again because despite the pain it's it's worth it and James is saying despite the pain it's worth

460
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,160
 it. The Bible says, "I consider this present suffering not worth even comparing to what awaits us."

461
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,400
 Think about that. It's not even worth talking about. That's what he's saying. The worst thing you could

462
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,920
 walk through it's not even worth talking about. It's not even worth comparing. It's not even worth

463
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,000
 mentioning. Do you know what is ahead? And that's hard to reconcile for me at times.

464
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,760
 But that's what James who spent time walking eyeball to eyeball with the savior of the world,

465
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,520
 his half-brother, said it's not even worth comparing. Don't lose heart. Don't let go.

466
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,360
 He's at work and you can trust him. I mentioned and I'll close here with I think the thing

467
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,560
 that ministered to me honestly the most this week preparing this message. I mentioned that James had

468
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,040
 not always believed in Jesus. We're told if you read the gospels there's so many different occasions

469
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,040
 where his family thinks he's crazy. In other words, growing up when you know Jesus would be like,

470
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,440
 "I'm the son of God." James wasn't like, "It's my brother. Hey, he's the son of God." He was like, "Oh, my

471
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,040
 brother thinks he's the son of God. This is so awkward." All of his brothers thought that. In Mark chapter

472
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,120
 three, we're told that there was this occasion where Jesus was teaching and he's telling these

473
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,640
 things to people. And it says that his family when they heard this, they went to take charge of him

474
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,120
 because they thought he was out of his mind. John chapter 7, it's the same thing. His brothers

475
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:27,200
 were like, "Oh, savior. Yeah, you should go to the big city, old savior boy." And it says because they

476
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,280
 didn't believe him. They had not believed. And James walked and despite seeing all these incredible

477
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,920
 things, he just thought his brother was weird. He didn't believe. And I was telling my son last night,

478
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,400
 we do story time and we've transitioned from doing dinosaur stories to Jesus stories, which feels like

479
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,200
 a parenting win in my book, at night. And I was just preparing this message and kind of in the

480
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,640
 middle of it, I was like, "Hey, do you want to hear the story of Jesus's baby brother?" And as a five-year-old

481
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:01,760
 he did what probably some of you did, which is like, "Jesus had a brother?" It's like, "Yeah." I said, "James

482
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,160
 was his name." And James didn't always believe in Jesus. And he loved his brother, but he just didn't

483
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:15,680
 think he was, you know, anything special. Thought he was different and unique, but not God. Not God's son.

484
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,200
 Which is, I mean, side note, it's pretty normal. Am I right? Anybody in here that they're like, "There

485
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,200
 were a couple times growing up where my sister, Sarah, like I was almost like, 'Son of God, maybe?'"

486
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,440
 I mean, it'd be a little challenging for most of us to be like, "Yeah, yeah, I could get there pretty

487
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,800
 easily. I mean, my brother is straight-A student." And it's pretty understandable that he was like,

488
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:44,560
 "I just, I know him. He's awesome, but not God." And then something happened. His brother, that he had

489
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,480
 tried with his other brothers to like, "Get away. Dude, you're crazy. Come back home with us."

490
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,080
 His brother was arrested. He was arrested because he was starting this, like, they called it a cult.

491
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,000
 They started this little movement called "The Way," and they arrested Jesus. And James is going, "Man, I

492
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,360
 knew something like this was going to happen. I knew this would happen. We should have done more. We

493
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,400
 should have been more forceful. Should have got him home." He's now being arrested, and then things

494
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,680
 take a bad turn, and they put his brother Jesus on trial. And he may not have believed he's the son

495
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,400
 of God, but who in here is like, "Man, I want what had to be the nicest person James ever met.

496
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:23,280
 I want him to be killed. That's my brother." No. Surely this is going to stop. I mean, he's got to

497
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:32,640
 be able to stop this from happening. And he has his 33-year-old brother crucified, which would have

498
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,880
 been like electrocuted outside of the city walls. It was reserved for the worst of criminals. He has

499
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,600
 what is such a shameful way to die happen to his older brother. What emotions go through you in

500
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,520
 that moment? He didn't know the end. Like, we sit on this vantage point. We're like, "He knew the end.

501
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,320
 Three days later, it's Friday, but Sunday's coming." He didn't know the end. No one did. No one thought

502
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,240
 he was going to rise from the grave. Like, we see the Bible through the lens of today. We're like,

503
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,360
 "Oh yeah, they all knew. They gathered around. They probably had a big tailgate. They're gathering

504
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,600
 around on Sunday outside of it, and they're like, 'Wait, did I see a movement with that stone? Okay.

505
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:11,200
 Oh, here it comes. Ten, nine. No. None of that happened.'" He's going, "My brother is dead.

506
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,480
 How could this happen?"

507
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,360
 And three days later, something happened that no one thought would.

508
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:34,320
 That tomb rolled away, and Jesus defeated death for him, for you, and for me.

509
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:41,280
 And as he went around, and he rose from the grave saying, "I pay for every sin

510
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,520
 in all humanity, red, yellow, black, and white. All of them are precious in my sight, and all of

511
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:55,920
 them I gave my life." And he went around, and he eventually ascended to heaven. But before he did,

512
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,840
 this was so powerful to me. In 1 Corinthians 15, we're told what Jesus did. He had this, like,

513
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,080
 short window where he came out of the grave, and he showed up to small groups of people.

514
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:11,280
 You know who were the first people that he shows up to? 1 Corinthians 15, it tells us that,

515
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,960
 "Hey, he rose from the grave, and then he appeared, and he appeared to Peter." He goes up, and of

516
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,080
 course, Peter's the leader of the disciples. Of course, he's going to be like, "Peter, I'm back."

517
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,200
 And then he goes, and he appears to the disciples. Of course, he's going to. And those are his guys.

518
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:29,120
 Who does he appear to? Whose name is mentioned next? James, the little brother of Jesus.

519
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,400
 That Jesus, despite the fact that James was not looking for him, had not believed in him,

520
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,200
 Jesus never stopped looking for James. And he shows up. What did that conversation look like?

521
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,960
 Because that was the one that changed everything. And he went from, "I don't believe in him at all,"

522
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,160
 to, "My brother is not just my brother. He's the Messiah. He's my Savior." Well, he shows up,

523
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,920
 and he says, "James, it's true. Everything has always been true. The reason why you thought

524
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,000
 I was different, because I was. The reason I didn't look like Dad, is because he wasn't my Dad.

525
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,720
 The reason all of it, it's all been true. I'm your Savior. I'm the Messiah. I love you. I just died

526
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,320
 for you. And I don't hold against you that you didn't believe in me." And James, in that day,

527
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,640
 everything changed. And he went from person who didn't believe at all, to leading the church in

528
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,160
 Jerusalem. When Paul writes in Galatians, he says, "The pillars of the church are Peter and the

529
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,640
 brother of our Lord, James." He went on to eventually be martyred and thrown off a building for the sake

530
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,160
 of spreading the gospel. What's the gospel? It is the good news about Jesus. And in a moment,

531
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:37,680
 the Savior of the world, the brother he grew up with, everything changed. And how we saw trials

532
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,280
 change, because how we saw Jesus changed. And whether he was ever looking for his brother,

533
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,960
 his brother never stopped looking for him. Somebody in the room tonight, you need to know,

534
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,160
 God, whether you're looking for him or have been, he's never stopped looking for you.

535
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,440
 And the moment you're going to change your perspective on trials, the moment you change

536
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,480
 the way that you see Jesus, he's not just some man, he's not just some person that was written

537
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,720
 about, he is the Savior of the world. And if you will put your faith in him, you're going to live

538
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,320
 forever and ever and ever. And whatever trial you walk through, James would say, "Don't let go.

539
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:16,960
 It's going to be worth it. Don't let go. Don't let go. He's the King. He's with you."

540
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:25,440
 Let me pray. Father, I pray for anyone who's never put their faith in the Son of God,

541
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:33,040
 Savior of the world, the King, the one they were made by and made for,

542
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,720
 the name above every name, Jesus. I thank you for just the testimony of James,

543
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:47,120
 personally, even how almost emotional and powerful it is to think

544
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:57,120
 that this brother had no belief in you, that you never stopped running towards and running after

545
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:03,200
 and even dying for, and that you have poured that same love and that same pursuit towards all of us.

546
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,960
 I pray for anyone who's never accepted the fact that you are the King, you're the risen one.

547
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,560
 You don't expect them to earn their way to you. You died so they could have eternal life by trusting

548
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,760
 in you, that tonight would be their night. I pray that as we journey through the book of James,

549
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,320
 you would minister to our hearts and we would hear the full truth by your Spirit,

550
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,400
 about what it looks like to walk with you. Thank you that you have preserved this incredible book,

551
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,440
 and I pray that you would use it to minister deeply to all of us listening in the room, online,

552
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,080
 and in all the different locations. We worship you. You're our King. You're the risen one.

553
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:46,400
 You're the Messiah. You're the Savior. And we declare and believe that and sing that now in song.

554
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,240
 Amen.
