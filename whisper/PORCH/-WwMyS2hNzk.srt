1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,300
 How we doing?

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,140
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,360
 Come on, come on, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,720
 wherever you're at, tuned in, we're so glad

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
 you're joining us in this effort to change the world

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,620
 for the name and the fame of Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,760
 And I wanna ask you this question up front today.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,760
 Why would you buy anything without trying it first?

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,360
 Especially in this day and age, right?

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,160
 You can try something before you financially commit to it.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,080
 And this isn't even really advice,

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,260
 like this is just the air we breathe,

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,880
 like this is what we do, okay?

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,600
 Companies are capitalizing on this idea

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,340
 that you can try before you buy, right?

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,640
 Warby Parker, if you want some glasses,

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,040
 you can reach out to them, they'll send you five pair

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,980
 to try out, you can see what you look like in 'em,

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,120
 you can keep the one you want, you can send the rest back.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,000
 Okay, this is not unique to them.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,520
 Grocery stores are picking up on this.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,760
 You can go in, you don't have to deliberate

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,520
 over which hummus you're gonna get this time

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,120
 and you don't, you know, how does it taste?

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,840
 'Cause I can't taste through the container.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,020
 At Whole Foods, you can actually go to them,

28
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,480
 I read this, and ask them, hey, can I try this product out?

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,320
 Can I sample it?

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 There's some rules around it, but you can try

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,040
 before you buy in grocery stores, right?

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,160
 There's a mattress company out there

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,140
 that says, you know, it's not just this guarantee,

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,640
 it's not like, hey, buy it, test it out, you can return it,

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,600
 but Novusbed says they will give you a mattress

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,560
 without you purchasing it for 120 days.

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,280
 And then after 120 days, you can return it

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,880
 or you can buy it from them,

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,920
 or you can exchange it for a different one.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,440
 There's a company out there with appliances, perch.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,160
 You can go into their showroom,

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,800
 you can take your dirty clothes with you

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,180
 or some dirty dishes.

44
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,160
 You can try out a dish washing machine,

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,560
 you can try out a washing machine, a dryer.

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,880
 You can try out their appliances before you purchase them.

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,640
 Here's some advice.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,880
 Before you financially commit to anything,

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,520
 especially if it's a big purchase,

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,200
 I would personally encourage you to try it out.

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,420
 The biggest one out there is, you know,

52
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,000
 that we talk about a lot is a car.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,260
 You can test drive a car.

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,240
 Why wouldn't you test drive a car

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,480
 before you make a purchase that big?

56
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,960
 I was interested in a car once, several times,

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,000
 but on this one particular occasion,

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I saw a car was a great deal, it was on Craigslist,

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
 I reached out to the individual

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
 and as I was talking to him on the phone,

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,840
 he was so excited.

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,480
 He said, hey, you've gotta drive it.

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,720
 If you drive this car, you're gonna buy it.

64
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,840
 I knew the price was right.

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,680
 I saw that it was cheaper than others on there.

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,860
 And so he said, man, I just gotta get you

67
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,240
 behind the wheel of this car.

68
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
 I said, okay.

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,300
 He was so eager that he actually showed up here.

70
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,040
 This was years ago, I just started working at Watermark

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,680
 and he shows up with the car.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,280
 I get in, I'm driving it down Park Central,

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,480
 this curvy road here.

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,880
 It had the Triptronic shifter, you know,

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,540
 it can shift on the steering wheel.

76
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,240
 It handled well, it was a really comfortable,

77
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,800
 fast, fun car, the price was right and I bought it.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,320
 And I loved it, I enjoyed that car for about a month.

79
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,900
 About a month into it, my wife calls me.

80
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,360
 She says, there's a police officer here.

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,840
 The Department of Motor Vehicles has sent over

82
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,960
 a police officer and they are asking me about your car.

83
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,920
 I thought, oh no.

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,360
 I got, I was a member of cinema desk, I got in the car,

85
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,680
 I drove over there as quickly as I could.

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,840
 I got there, they said, sir, do you own this vehicle?

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
 I said, yes I do.

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,540
 They said, not anymore, it's stolen.

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,240
 I said, it can't be stolen.

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,160
 I said, the guy had the title and an ID and everything.

91
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,920
 They said, it's a fake ID.

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,080
 He purchased the car under false pretense

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,920
 with a fake cashier's check.

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,180
 It was not his vehicle to sell you.

95
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,940
 It's a stolen car and they left with my vehicle

96
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,660
 on the back of a tow truck.

97
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,580
 Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands

98
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,940
 of dollars down the toilet.

99
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,020
 Which is what brings me to what I wanna talk to you

100
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,980
 about this evening.

101
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,080
 Is the reality of it, that was not his to sell me.

102
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,480
 And so as we talk about this idea of trying before you buy

103
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,920
 as it relates to sex or as it relates to your body,

104
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,740
 that's the problem with the advice.

105
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,900
 It ain't yours.

106
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,900
 It's not yours to give away.

107
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,900
 It was entrusted to you by God for a purpose.

108
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,240
 And if you do anything with that body that he loaned to you

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,780
 outside of his purpose, it's abuse.

110
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,060
 It's abuse.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,760
 And so this is the problem with this advice

112
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,760
 that's not even advice, it's just the world we live in.

113
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,240
 Nobody's telling you this, they just expect it of you.

114
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:36,640
 It's like we have this neighbor family.

115
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,200
 You see this couple, they got their act together,

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,760
 they're clean cut, straight laced.

117
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,200
 Your friends kinda make fun of them

118
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
 'cause they never really go and get drunk

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,160
 and they're not wild and they're just kind of

120
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,400
 like this really straight laced family.

121
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,200
 But as you look into it, you realize

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,120
 it seems like they have a really healthy marriage,

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,140
 like they love each other, like they really enjoy each other.

124
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,360
 And they're pulling you aside

125
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,120
 and they start their day in God's word

126
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,360
 and they pray before meals

127
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
 and it just seems like they love God

128
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,040
 and they go to church together and they pull you aside

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,580
 and they say, yeah, you really should pursue purity

130
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,760
 and you blow it off as old fashioned advice.

131
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,840
 But then you've got this crazy uncle.

132
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,680
 He's been married three times, he loves to party,

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,800
 he's got a stack of porn magazines on the coffee table

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
 and he pulls you aside and he's like,

135
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,400
 hey, listen, you wanna try before you buy.

136
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 And for some reason, we take advice from the crazy uncle.

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,920
 It's bad advice, why do we do it?

138
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,560
 We're in this series called Bad Advice.

139
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,440
 Tonight we're talking about this idea

140
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,000
 of trying before you buy as it relates to sex.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,640
 It's also like, hey, it's just sex is what they might say

142
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,440
 or hey, wait until you're ready, what does that even mean?

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,800
 I've been ready since the fifth grade.

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,400
 I mean, who's not ready to have sex, right?

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,520
 And so I was talking to this guy who has this marriage

146
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,640
 that I really respect, kind of like that neighbor

147
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,120
 I talked about a moment ago.

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,320
 He said he's one of the most godly men I know,

149
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,720
 one of the most God-fearing men I know.

150
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,200
 He travels and talks about marriage,

151
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,040
 his marriage is that healthy.

152
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,440
 He loves God, he loves Jesus.

153
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,160
 And we were talking once and he just said,

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,320
 you know, JP, you and I talk about sex very differently.

155
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,080
 And I said, well, what do you mean?

156
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,440
 I'm listening because this is a man I really respect.

157
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,760
 And he says, I just like sex.

158
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,560
 I haven't, he said this, he goes,

159
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
 I haven't had sex with my wife in 17 years.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,640
 And I thought, oh no.

161
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,840
 Can I pray for you?

162
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,000
 I don't know what to do.

163
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,120
 And then he goes on, I realized I misunderstood him.

164
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
 Then he goes on to say,

165
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,720
 sex is what dogs do on the side of the road.

166
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,640
 He said the intimacy that we experience,

167
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,520
 the closeness and the oneness that happens

168
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,640
 when we do that act that God created,

169
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,200
 that he gifted to us,

170
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,600
 I can't even call it what the world calls it.

171
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,280
 See, some of you, your biggest fear tonight

172
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,800
 is that you'll never have sex.

173
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
 That's not your biggest fear.

174
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,480
 That shouldn't be your biggest fear.

175
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,440
 Your biggest fear should be that you might only have sex.

176
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,600
 That that might all, that might be the only thing you have.

177
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,960
 And you never experienced the deeper intimacy

178
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
 that God has designed us for between two people

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,840
 when they come together in a place where there's no shame.

180
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,840
 And it's holy and it's spiritual and it's deep

181
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,120
 and it's meaningful and it's gentle and it's kind

182
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
 and it's loving and it's patient and it's amazing.

183
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,160
 And that's what I want for you.

184
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,640
 So listen up.

185
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,920
 We're gonna be in 1 Corinthians chapter six.

186
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,120
 If you have your Bibles, please turn there.

187
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,680
 I'm gonna show you some stats real quick

188
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,200
 that will kinda tell you from the world

189
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
 that this is bad advice.

190
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,040
 The divorce rate, as you know, is around 50%.

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,420
 It hovers there.

192
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,640
 Couples though, however, when they get married

193
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,720
 and they're both virgins, that divorce rate of 50%

194
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
 goes down to 9%.

195
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,400
 Do you think God knows what he's doing?

196
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,160
 I really wish I would've known this.

197
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,480
 I wish someone would've told me this

198
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,240
 when I was in my early 20s or coming out of high school

199
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
 or really coming out of junior high.

200
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,960
 I wish somebody would've told me.

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,080
 If you wait until you're married, just you,

202
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,100
 just one of the partners,

203
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,800
 your chances of divorce decrease by 70%.

204
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
 Here's some stats on cohabitation.

205
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
 That really is the nature of Try Before You Buy

206
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,980
 these days, that you would live together.

207
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,040
 This comes from the US Attorney Legal Services.

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,440
 Couples who live together are 250% more likely to divorce

209
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
 in the first five years of marriage than those who haven't.

210
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,640
 90% of couples who live together don't get married.

211
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,200
 Consider some of you who've lived together

212
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,960
 and you're no longer with that person.

213
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,040
 80% of those that get married end up getting divorced.

214
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,120
 Okay, here's what that means.

215
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,160
 Those are fast statistics.

216
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,320
 Let's just say there's 100 people up here.

217
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,520
 They've all lived together before they were married.

218
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,960
 We'll take 90 of them and we'll get rid of them.

219
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
 They won't get married.

220
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,400
 There's 10 left.

221
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,560
 80% of those 10 will get divorced.

222
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,360
 We'll remove eight from those 10.

223
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
 There's two left.

224
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 Two out of 100 people will have a successful marriage.

225
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,920
 Does God know what he's doing?

226
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,240
 How smart is the world?

227
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,520
 You're gonna keep taking advice from the world?

228
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,880
 Keep taking advice from your crazy uncle.

229
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,740
 You can have a marriage just like him.

230
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,280
 His first, second, third.

231
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,200
 What are we doing?

232
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,420
 Try before you buy.

233
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,000
 Paul's going to tackle some bad advice of his day.

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,120
 As we move through it, we're gonna talk about

235
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,560
 the purpose of sex, the power of sexual sin,

236
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
 and before you leave here this evening,

237
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
 the price of healing.

238
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,580
 And so what's going on is he's writing this letter

239
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,560
 to the church in Corinth.

240
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,620
 There's over 1,000 temple prostitutes

241
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,360
 because of the goddess Aphrodite.

242
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,160
 She has a temple there in Corinth.

243
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,040
 So you go to church, you can have sex with a prostitute.

244
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
 He's writing into that culture.

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,640
 There's this other phenomenon going on.

246
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,460
 It's an overcorrection that they say,

247
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,980
 well, sex is physical and only the spiritual is good,

248
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,320
 and so sex is bad.

249
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,240
 So he's trying to address to them that sex is not bad.

250
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,160
 Sex is good.

251
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,680
 It's a gift from God, but you shouldn't have it

252
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,000
 with people that you're not committed to in marriage.

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,880
 And so he writes this in verse 12.

254
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,160
 I have the right to do anything, in quotes, you say, he says.

255
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,880
 This is a popular saying at that time.

256
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,280
 This is bad advice.

257
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,320
 People are going around, hey, man, do whatever feels good.

258
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,160
 Do whatever you want.

259
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,040
 Follow your heart.

260
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,120
 I have the right to do anything, you say,

261
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,440
 but not everything is beneficial.

262
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,440
 He's saying, man, that's bad advice.

263
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,040
 Choices have consequences.

264
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,060
 I have the right to do anything, in quotes,

265
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,040
 but I will not be mastered by anything.

266
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,320
 There are things that you do that you can't stop doing.

267
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,880
 There are things you wanted the freedom to do,

268
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,480
 but then you don't have the freedom to stop.

269
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,160
 You get trapped, you get stuck.

270
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,680
 You say, again, bad advice, food for the stomach

271
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,200
 and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.

272
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
 This is the bad advice of that time.

273
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,640
 He's writing this.

274
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,760
 It's still bad advice today.

275
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,780
 He's saying, hey, you eat whatever you're hungry for.

276
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,420
 You do whatever feels good.

277
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,800
 You do whatever seems right.

278
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,080
 Even though the Proverbs say there's a way

279
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,160
 that seems right to a person,

280
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,520
 but in the end it leads to death.

281
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,640
 He's saying, hey, there are things that you eat

282
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,400
 that will ultimately destroy you.

283
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,440
 All right, we know this.

284
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,480
 We've learned this one.

285
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,160
 When you're little, like you want ice cream

286
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

287
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
 Anybody love ice cream?

288
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,020
 I love ice cream.

289
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,080
 Blue Bell, I'm all about it.

290
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,360
 Yeah, okay, but you probably didn't have it today

291
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,640
 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

292
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,520
 You learned that.

293
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
 It's not wise when you're a freshman

294
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
 and you gain 15 pounds.

295
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
 It wasn't wise, right?

296
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,760
 They're like, hey, I'm not gonna do that.

297
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,360
 We know that that's not smart.

298
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
 Even though it tastes good, even though you enjoy it,

299
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,280
 hey, I'm not gonna do that.

300
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,040
 My in-laws, they love Golden Corral.

301
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,880
 Pray for them.

302
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,360
 So I've been with them.

303
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,440
 I gotta say, it's a tremendous value, the Golden Corral.

304
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
 And there's always this family.

305
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,480
 I don't mean to be mean or insensitive,

306
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,840
 but there's this family there,

307
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,160
 and they're piling up the dessert,

308
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,500
 and they're clearly unhealthy.

309
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,760
 They're destroying themselves,

310
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,160
 and they're going through the buffet line

311
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
 and just heaping it up, getting plates and plates,

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,360
 and it's like, man, you need a friend.

313
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,840
 You need someone to come alongside you

314
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,800
 and say, that is destructive.

315
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,400
 And this is what Paul is saying.

316
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,000
 No, the stomach is for food,

317
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,120
 but not to eat whatever you wanna eat

318
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
 whenever you wanna eat it.

319
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,020
 And in the same way, if you say,

320
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,980
 well, I have an appetite for sex,

321
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,080
 so I'm just going to pursue release,

322
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,600
 that is foolish and ignorant,

323
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 and not what that hunger pain is meant to be satisfied by.

324
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:09,980
 The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality

325
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,760
 before the Lord, and the Lord for the body,

326
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,120
 by his power, God raised the Lord from the dead,

327
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,080
 and he will raise us also.

328
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,440
 You wanna know if God cares about your body?

329
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,920
 He cares about it so much, he's gonna preserve it

330
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,360
 and carry it into eternity.

331
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
 Do you not know that your bodies

332
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,060
 are members of Christ himself?

333
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,640
 Your body, it belongs to Jesus.

334
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,760
 Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them?

335
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,320
 That word unite them is literally glue them,

336
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,880
 stick them with a prostitute.

337
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,800
 Never, he writes, do you not know that he

338
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,640
 who unites himself with a prostitute,

339
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,840
 this word for prostitute, it is any person

340
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,520
 that you would have sex without a marriage,

341
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,240
 check me on that.

342
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,440
 In the Greek, we translate it prostitute.

343
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,680
 In the earliest translations, hey, this is someone,

344
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,840
 but it's not someone you would pay for to have sex with.

345
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,040
 It's someone that you would have sex with

346
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,480
 that you're not in a covenant relationship with.

347
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
 Do you not know that he who unites himself

348
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,560
 with a prostitute is one with her in body?

349
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
 For it is said, the two will become one flesh.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
 This is design talk, Paul is saying.

351
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,080
 He's saying, hey, this body was given to you,

352
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,960
 it was designed to you, it was designed by a person,

353
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,720
 it was designed by a deity.

354
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,120
 It had a designer, and something is happening

355
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,960
 that you don't fully understand.

356
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,460
 When you go through this act, we call sex.

357
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,160
 But whoever is united with the Lord

358
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,180
 is one with him in spirit.

359
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,400
 Paul is going to great lengths to say,

360
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,720
 hey, there's not a separation from your body

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
 and what is spiritual.

362
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
 Your body is spiritual, and what you do

363
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,040
 with your body is spiritual.

364
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,680
 You can't avoid that.

365
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,840
 God has a purpose for your body,

366
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,680
 so before you go doing something with it,

367
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,200
 you should consult with him.

368
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,920
 And so my first point today is the purpose of sex.

369
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
 We're gonna talk about the purpose of sex,

370
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,600
 that God is the master designer of sex.

371
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,720
 And so if you wanna understand how to do something,

372
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,020
 there's a couple ways that you can learn about it.

373
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,020
 One is you can talk to someone who's done it a lot.

374
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,960
 But practice doesn't always make perfect, right?

375
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,380
 If it did, if we thought, hey, you know,

376
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,120
 the person who's the best at this act

377
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,360
 is the one who's done it a lot, is we're all,

378
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,000
 then we're gonna be looking for the person

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
 who's had the most sex, who's had the most partners,

380
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,320
 we're gonna say, that's who I want as my spouse.

381
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
 But nobody thinks that way.

382
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,160
 Okay, so then you could talk to someone

383
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,520
 who's really good at it.

384
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,440
 But this good at it is also confusing

385
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
 because our culture has dumbed it down to technique.

386
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
 And there are people who claim to be great lovers

387
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,640
 who have miserable marriages and multiple marriages.

388
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
 So there's gotta be something more to this technique.

389
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,740
 What we do not understand, what we failed to realize

390
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,180
 as a culture in 2017 is sex is spiritual.

391
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,320
 That it's a spiritual act.

392
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,680
 And so why not talk to the one who made it?

393
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,280
 That's what you can do if you wanna learn

394
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,120
 a lot about something is you can talk

395
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,180
 to the one who invented the act.

396
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,520
 God, he's pro-sex.

397
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,400
 He's all about it, it was his idea,

398
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
 it was his genius, glorious, amazing idea.

399
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
 Father, Son, and Spirit, I don't know if they had

400
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,800
 a whiteboard or what, I imagine they didn't have

401
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,640
 a whiteboard, they didn't need one.

402
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,980
 But they're just like, what if we did this

403
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,200
 and this is how we brought life in?

404
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,480
 Like, that's a great idea.

405
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,260
 We'll make it feel good, it's gonna be awesome.

406
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
 How do we do that?

407
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,200
 Well, we'll make the man like this and a female like this

408
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
 and this part will fit there, it's genius.

409
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,380
 I was gonna get so much more awkward than that,

410
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,340
 so buckle up, okay, we're just getting started.

411
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,200
 Let me just show you that God is pro-sex.

412
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
 I'm gonna read to you from the Bible, okay?

413
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,680
 This is Song of Solomon, chapter seven.

414
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,720
 It's a man talking to a woman.

415
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,680
 Your stature is like that of a palm

416
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,800
 and your breasts are like clusters of fruit.

417
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,400
 I said I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit.

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,800
 Try not to do things with my hands.

419
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,640
 May--

420
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,900
 [congregation laughing]

421
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,680
 May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine.

422
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,880
 The fragrance of your breath like apples

423
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,200
 and your mouth like the best wine.

424
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,560
 And then she responds,

425
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,800
 may the wine go straight to my beloved

426
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,840
 flowing gently over his lips and teeth.

427
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,180
 I belong to my beloved and his desire is for me.

428
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,280
 I'll stop right there so you can sleep tonight.

429
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,560
 But it goes on in tremendous detail

430
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,200
 talking about how incredible

431
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,120
 it can be between two people who love each other.

432
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,680
 When they celebrate this gift that God gave us,

433
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,240
 he's pro-sex, he invented it,

434
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,560
 he made us for it.

435
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,480
 He designed us for it.

436
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,120
 He made the parts, not just the way they work,

437
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,800
 the way they do, but he also put the nerve endings

438
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,040
 where he did so that it would feel the way that it does.

439
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,220
 It was all God's genius plan.

440
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,940
 It's his design.

441
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,040
 And so a man has a sexual organ

442
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,680
 which places a seed inside a woman's sexual organ

443
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,760
 that fertilizes an egg so that a life is born.

444
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
 How stinking genius is this?

445
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,060
 That this is how we would cover the earth

446
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,640
 with God followers.

447
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,120
 That life would be brought when two people

448
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,320
 who love Jesus come together

449
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,880
 and they celebrate this gift from God,

450
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,760
 life is brought forth.

451
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,660
 And children, God says, are a blessing,

452
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,840
 but we don't always see children as a blessing, do we?

453
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,480
 Sometimes we see them as an inconvenient.

454
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,400
 And so God in his genius ways,

455
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
 thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago,

456
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,720
 said, you know what, we better make this act feel good

457
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,700
 so that they will bring this life forth.

458
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,000
 Because if it didn't feel good,

459
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
 like if sex felt like a spinal tap,

460
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
 we probably wouldn't have kids, right?

461
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,420
 And the human beings would probably die out.

462
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,040
 God's genius plan.

463
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,400
 Do you know the first command that God gave human beings?

464
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,140
 In Genesis chapter one, verse 28,

465
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,100
 God made them male and female,

466
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,640
 and then he says this, have a lot of sex.

467
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,780
 That's the message version.

468
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,780
 He said, be fruitful and multiply.

469
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,440
 Be fruitful and multiply.

470
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,380
 Have a lot of children.

471
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,520
 This is my plan for covering the earth

472
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,120
 with people who love me.

473
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,260
 I want you to do this act a lot and bring forth life.

474
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,100
 And so this feeling good, it does something.

475
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,560
 But God didn't just make the parts the way that he did

476
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,180
 and made it feel the way that it does.

477
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,720
 He wired it into then our brains

478
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,600
 so that whenever we experience,

479
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,740
 I need you to hear this, okay?

480
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,060
 And I need you to tell people 'cause this is not taught.

481
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,380
 Whenever we experience that act,

482
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,500
 and we specifically, we experience the climax of that act

483
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,540
 or release or orgasm,

484
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,100
 what happens is our brain releases dopamine.

485
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,220
 Dopamine is what makes you feel good.

486
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,820
 It gives you a euphoric feeling, a sensation.

487
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,680
 It's the highest levels of dopamine

488
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,060
 that can naturally be released in a person

489
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,740
 is through the act of sex and specifically the climax.

490
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,840
 This is why people will give their lives to it.

491
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,560
 This is why you felt like something fun

492
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
 has been kept from you.

493
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,080
 Like God's trying to keep something from you.

494
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,600
 He's not, there's a design around it.

495
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,480
 That act, what happens then

496
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
 when you experience that feel good cessation

497
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
 is your brain creates what's called a synapse.

498
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,560
 A synapse is like a muscle, almost like a memory muscle.

499
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,600
 What that does is, this is important,

500
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,800
 is it bonds your five senses to your surroundings.

501
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,960
 And there's all kinds of phenomenons around this.

502
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,080
 Modern secular psychology calls this phenomenon sex glue.

503
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,120
 That there's a person that will get

504
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,000
 so addicted to pornography,

505
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,120
 they can't experience an erection without porn there

506
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,080
 because they've glued themselves

507
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,500
 physiologically to pornography.

508
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,880
 And so you can imagine, this is why he says

509
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,560
 in 1 Corinthians 16, the two will become one flesh.

510
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,840
 He says they literally will become stuck together.

511
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,920
 And so here's a visual for you.

512
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,600
 It's gonna blow your mind.

513
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,240
 You're gonna be like, whoa.

514
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,360
 You ready?

515
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
 You ready for this?

516
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,800
 Two

517
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,880
 become one.

518
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,100
 Boom.

519
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,080
 That just happened.

520
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,240
 (congregation applauding)

521
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,400
 Stuck together.

522
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
 Bonded.

523
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,880
 What happens in that synapse, and this is important,

524
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,020
 I want you to remember this word, standard,

525
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,020
 is whoever you experience sexual release with,

526
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,440
 they become your standard.

527
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,800
 This is so genius in the safeness of marriage

528
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,240
 that as her body changes and his body changes

529
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,320
 and they age, as they continue to come back together

530
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
 in this act, they become each other's standard.

531
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,960
 The marriage is safeguarded, right?

532
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,040
 Other people can't come into that

533
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,400
 because they are each other's standard.

534
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
 This is a real phenomenon.

535
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 It really happens.

536
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,240
 It happens with that neighbor I was talking about earlier.

537
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,840
 When they're the only two people that they've experienced,

538
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,500
 they are each other's standard, and it's safe.

539
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,400
 There's no shame there, no embarrassment.

540
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,840
 You don't have to wonder if he's comparing you

541
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,560
 through the six other girls,

542
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,480
 or she's comparing you to that ex-boyfriend.

543
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,640
 You don't have to wonder about that.

544
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,040
 And this phenomenon, this is where those insecurities

545
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,620
 come from because when you try to pull it apart,

546
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,240
 it's destructive.

547
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,640
 It's destructive.

548
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,580
 And the shame creeps in, and the insecurities creep in,

549
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,480
 and the feelings of doubt creep in,

550
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,080
 and the questioning creeps in, and the wondering creeps in,

551
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,480
 and the marriage and the relationship is no longer safe.

552
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,920
 This was God's genius design.

553
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,540
 We've taken it, and we think we know better than the creator.

554
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:41,280
 This is pretty much a picture of my life 12 years ago.

555
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,960
 Walking around in pieces, not even realizing it,

556
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,000
 celebrating the shame that happened

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,720
 because we've dumbed sex down to technique.

558
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
 We're so worried about the honeymoon

559
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,320
 that we've traded the 20-year anniversary

560
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,720
 for a great honeymoon.

561
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,000
 I know a lot of believing couples

562
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,400
 that don't even have sex on their wedding night.

563
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:16,720
 I might dare to say that most, or close to most,

564
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,360
 don't even have sex on their wedding night.

565
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,200
 And you say, man, that's crazy,

566
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,040
 I never even thought about that.

567
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,560
 It happens, true.

568
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,400
 Why?

569
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,920
 He's so gentle and kind and caring and patient.

570
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,440
 They experience intimacy.

571
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,480
 And maybe not even in that act on their wedding night,

572
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,320
 but they have the rest of their lives to figure that out.

573
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,160
 And for them, it just gets better and more enjoyable

574
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,000
 and more worshipful.

575
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,480
 And some of us will never have that.

576
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,040
 In fact, if you wanna try something before you buy it,

577
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,600
 that is to inspect it, look for patience.

578
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,200
 Look for their willingness to wait.

579
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,000
 Look for their willingness to pursue purity

580
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
 because you know that person is gonna do

581
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,760
 whatever it takes to keep your marriage pure.

582
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,720
 You know they haven't conditioned themselves

583
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,080
 to having sex outside of marriage.

584
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,600
 I would look for that, I would lean in for that.

585
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,160
 Look for the loving, kind, patient kind of person,

586
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,000
 the gentle kind of person.

587
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,240
 And so sex, it's for procreation,

588
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,800
 and it's for bonding two people together in marriage.

589
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,520
 It's not for pleasure.

590
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,560
 God made it pleasurable to accomplish

591
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,800
 those two other things.

592
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,720
 God, in his genius, kindness, and grace,

593
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,720
 made it feel good so that two people

594
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,200
 would be bonded together

595
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,920
 and that we would bring forth life.

596
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,840
 And so what we do now, listen,

597
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
 we try to prevent pregnancy

598
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
 and we try to prevent the bonding

599
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,160
 while capturing the pleasure

600
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,380
 and we're left with a cheap activity.

601
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,280
 We're left with a cheap thrill, a cheap thing.

602
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,560
 That's why he says, verse 18,

603
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
 "Flee from sexual immorality.

604
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,080
 "All other sins a person commits are outside the body,

605
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,880
 "but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body."

606
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,080
 He says, "Run from sexual sin

607
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,460
 "because it will hurt you in a really unique way.

608
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,800
 "All sin will cost you something."

609
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,880
 But Paul, the Holy Spirit through Paul says,

610
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,020
 "This one is going to cost you in a unique way.

611
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,660
 "It has a higher cost."

612
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,400
 Second point, the power of sexual sin,

613
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,040
 the power of sexual sin.

614
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,720
 Sexual immorality, that is sex, outside of God's design,

615
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,280
 impacts us emotionally, physiologically,

616
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,600
 physically and spiritually.

617
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,720
 And so consider how difficult it is

618
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,360
 to heal from sexual abuse.

619
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,440
 Would everyone here say,

620
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,520
 it's gotta be difficult to heal from sexual abuse?

621
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,480
 Can I get a head nod on that?

622
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,880
 It's gotta be difficult to heal.

623
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,460
 Abuse is defined as misuse.

624
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,580
 Anything that's done outside of design.

625
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,720
 So the vast majority of us tonight

626
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,040
 have endured some sort of sexual abuse.

627
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,520
 That is sex outside of God's design.

628
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
 That means the vast majority of us tonight

629
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 are in desperate need of healing.

630
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,360
 And that's your application for tonight.

631
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,840
 You have to pursue healing.

632
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
 And we're gonna talk about how.

633
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,120
 But that's what I want you to leave with.

634
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,540
 You've gotta pursue healing.

635
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,240
 And so masturbation is a type of sexual abuse,

636
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,020
 oral sex, sexting,

637
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,780
 any kind of sex outside of God's design.

638
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,100
 And so if God created sex to bond us to someone,

639
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,960
 consider what happens when we bond to multiple people.

640
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,600
 We train our bodies not to be sticky.

641
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,000
 We train our brains not to attach to someone.

642
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,980
 We've taken that and we begin to rewire us.

643
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,800
 The average millennial has eight sexual partners

644
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,640
 before marriage.

645
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,000
 Here's a visual aid for you,

646
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,540
 some Lego people, all right?

647
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,960
 And so if this is his and this is her sexual partner

648
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,380
 and they come together, right?

649
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,320
 It's not sticky.

650
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,640
 I know.

651
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,700
 Your minds are blown right now.

652
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,540
 You're like.

653
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,380
 This is what you're gonna,

654
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,420
 but just think about it.

655
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,360
 Think about this.

656
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,860
 You are rewiring yourself

657
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,340
 when you take that outside of God's design.

658
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,100
 You're retraining yourself.

659
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,260
 You're taking something that God created to protect you

660
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,060
 and you're using it in a destructive way.

661
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:54,720
 Do you remember what I said that whoever experiences,

662
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,380
 whoever we experience sexual release with,

663
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,500
 they become our standards?

664
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,180
 And so imagine what happens when we introduce pornography

665
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,220
 into the picture.

666
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,520
 16 clicks of airbrushed perfection into the picture

667
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,180
 that that would become our new standard.

668
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,020
 Imagine the problems that we run into then, right?

669
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,580
 There is no satisfying a porn addict.

670
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:28,120
 There is no way that you are going to fulfill

671
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,640
 someone who has gone through a university

672
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,080
 of training themselves meticulously

673
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,680
 toward multiple partners in adultery over and over and over.

674
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,880
 And we may not know each other,

675
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,460
 so you may be like, man,

676
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,200
 preacher boy's coming down strong, heavy handed.

677
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,040
 That's my story.

678
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,880
 I speak from experience.

679
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,160
 I've met hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of porn addicts.

680
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,000
 I've never met anyone as struggled as much as I did.

681
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,720
 Not because I think I'm terminally unique,

682
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,720
 I just know how sick and depraved my mind was

683
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,520
 before Jesus Christ.

684
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,360
 And when I was introduced to this at an early age,

685
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,360
 I tasted something that was good.

686
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,840
 And then I had the freedom of the internet in my own house.

687
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,180
 And I could go through click after click

688
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,160
 after click of perversion,

689
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,020
 slowly and meticulously rewiring my brain

690
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,600
 so that when I got married,

691
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,840
 there is no possible earthly way

692
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,620
 that any human being woman was going to satisfy me.

693
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,700
 And so I spent the past decade in recovery

694
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,440
 so that I can love her in a way that honors God

695
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,780
 and honor God with my body as the scripture commands.

696
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,680
 And it wasn't just the pornography,

697
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,200
 but it was relationship after sexual relationship

698
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
 after sexual relationship.

699
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,440
 But there's healing.

700
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,700
 That's what I want you to know.

701
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,600
 There's healing.

702
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
 You're not left hopeless.

703
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,760
 The only person who won't find hope

704
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,300
 is the one who leaves here and doesn't look for it.

705
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,920
 God wants to restore you.

706
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,440
 He wants to help you.

707
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,440
 I thought I would struggle with pornography

708
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,480
 until I was married.

709
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,220
 The struggle became the most difficult to manage

710
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,460
 after marriage as a believer.

711
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,860
 It felt like Jesus wasn't working.

712
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,380
 I'm like a dog to his vomit.

713
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,120
 I'm running back to these things

714
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,440
 that are slowly destroying me.

715
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,520
 And I'm like, Jesus, I thought you were gonna save me.

716
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,040
 I thought you were gonna help me.

717
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,480
 Like I thought I'd come to you and you clean up my life.

718
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,840
 And I didn't realize that my sin had consequences

719
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,800
 that I had to sit in, that I had to heal from it.

720
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,280
 Took time, right?

721
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,400
 And so yes, those wounds will heal,

722
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,520
 but you'll be left with scars

723
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,000
 at least until you get that renewed body,

724
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,360
 that glorified body.

725
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,840
 I don't wanna misrepresent anything to you tonight.

726
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,840
 I cannot remove all of the consequences of your sin

727
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,260
 here on this earth.

728
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,580
 There will be consequences to your choices,

729
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,080
 but they will be prolonged if you leave here

730
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,260
 and you do not pursue healing.

731
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,640
 Jesus can heal your wounds.

732
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,840
 You know, all kinds of wounds.

733
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,740
 One in four of you tonight has an STD.

734
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,240
 One in four.

735
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
 A lot of you don't even know it.

736
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,720
 And I can't make those go away.

737
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,120
 Some of you've had abortions.

738
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,440
 I cannot undo that.

739
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,620
 I can point you to the grace of God

740
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,520
 and I can show you how to take that mess

741
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,740
 and make it a message and help heal others

742
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,180
 and have God turn it into a ministry,

743
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,460
 but I can't undo that.

744
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,140
 I can't erase those images,

745
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,580
 the hundreds of images you've slowly fed your heart

746
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,300
 through your brain, through your eyes.

747
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,340
 I can't make them go away.

748
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,540
 I can't make you a virgin again.

749
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,580
 And I wouldn't trust anyone who says they can.

750
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,720
 That's crazy.

751
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,100
 But I can give you hope.

752
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,260
 But I can give you hope.

753
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,260
 And the best thing for being a really great lover

754
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,660
 isn't practice, it's purity.

755
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:31,340
 The best thing to become a really great lover

756
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,740
 is not more practice, it's purity.

757
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,620
 Someone recently asked me

758
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,100
 if I ever thought about other women

759
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,500
 when I was with my wife, Monica.

760
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,100
 And I thought about that.

761
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:58,360
 And my answer surprised me in a really delightful way,

762
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,200
 the best kind of way.

763
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,600
 I just said two wonderful words.

764
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,100
 I said, not anymore.

765
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,420
 Not anymore.

766
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,020
 I know I used to have a Rolodex

767
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,260
 that my brain would spin through.

768
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,220
 I'm ashamed to tell you, man.

769
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,320
 Ashamed to tell you.

770
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,960
 But 12 years of pursuing Christ,

771
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
 pursuing intimacy with Him,

772
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,860
 listen, I've had all kinds of sex.

773
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,900
 But I've never experienced anything as beautiful

774
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,400
 and as spiritual and as worshipful

775
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,180
 as what I have today.

776
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,240
 And it just gets better and better and better.

777
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,120
 And I'm not selling you a bill of goods.

778
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,600
 I'm telling you the truth.

779
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,020
 There is hope for you.

780
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:52,180
 But it starts with you pursuing healing.

781
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,520
 Why would you wait, man?

782
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,500
 Verse 19, do you not know that your bodies

783
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,720
 are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

784
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,760
 whom you've received from God?

785
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
 You are not your own.

786
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,200
 You were bought at a price.

787
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,920
 Therefore, honor God with your bodies.

788
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,920
 I want everyone to look down at their body right now.

789
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,420
 At your own body, not your neighbor's body.

790
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,920
 Look down at your own body, okay?

791
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,560
 You too, Fort Worth and Houston,

792
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,280
 everybody look down at your body.

793
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,040
 That's not yours.

794
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,860
 It doesn't belong to you.

795
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,680
 You have it on loan, okay?

796
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
 You don't have to be happy with it

797
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,000
 or critical of it or anything.

798
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,160
 It's not yours, okay?

799
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,360
 God gave it to you and He gave it to you

800
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,720
 for a really specific reason,

801
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,440
 that you would honor Him with it,

802
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,760
 that you would glorify Him in what you do with it.

803
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,240
 It belongs to Him.

804
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,700
 And so I wanna talk about the price of healing.

805
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,740
 Before we leave here,

806
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,520
 let's talk about the price of healing.

807
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,340
 So you have this body on loan, right?

808
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,900
 You would never loan something to someone else

809
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,340
 that was lent to you.

810
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,240
 Like if you have something that doesn't belong to you

811
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,220
 and somebody says, hey, can I borrow that nail polish

812
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,060
 or your car?

813
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,500
 And you're like, no, it's not mine to give to you.

814
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,700
 And that's the mindset I want you to think

815
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,800
 before you give this to someone else

816
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,740
 or let someone else do anything with it.

817
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,600
 They need to consult the owner that is God.

818
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,840
 Sex, it's an act of worship to Him.

819
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
 And that's why the enemy is going after it.

820
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,600
 He hates you.

821
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,920
 He hates when people worship God.

822
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,440
 And so he wants to take this act of worship

823
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,560
 and dumb it down to a momentary pursuit

824
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,860
 of fleeting pleasure.

825
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,720
 So he's after sex and he's trying to destroy it

826
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,000
 and redefine it and make it something

827
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,740
 that it was never meant to be.

828
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,020
 And so why not try before you buy?

829
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,940
 Because you're not buying anything.

830
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,760
 You're not a product.

831
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,080
 You are a human being.

832
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,080
 You belong to God and you've been purchased by Jesus Christ

833
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,780
 and your body, it belongs to Him.

834
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,540
 And so if someone wants to do something with it,

835
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,780
 have them ask Him if they can.

836
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,460
 Can you think of a greater buzzkill?

837
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,600
 Hanging out, you know, hey,

838
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
 you wanna go back to your bedroom?

839
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,780
 I don't know, why don't we ask Jesus?

840
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,680
 (congregation laughing)

841
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,560
 Watching this movie, you wanna lay down?

842
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,640
 Nah, let's pray about that for an hour.

843
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,940
 (congregation laughing)

844
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,780
 Right?

845
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,460
 The price that God paid for your body is Jesus, His Son.

846
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,800
 The price that you pay for healing is purity

847
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,620
 and pursuing Jesus with everything you have.

848
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,860
 Verse 20, "Therefore, honor God with your body."

849
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,120
 Listen, friends, if you feel like damaged goods right now,

850
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,560
 and I know a lot of you do, I'm so sorry.

851
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,360
 I know so many of you.

852
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,160
 You feel the condemnation, you feel the weight,

853
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,720
 the enemy, it's the lies he whispers.

854
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,300
 I know, I know.

855
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,640
 Talk to so many of you, I know you feel it.

856
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,800
 If you feel like damaged,

857
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,000
 if you feel like you're ruined right now,

858
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,800
 I want you to know something.

859
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,260
 You're in really good company.

860
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,740
 We're all damaged goods.

861
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,680
 We've all been ruined by sin.

862
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:18,840
 Those are the people that Jesus comes and He purchases

863
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,400
 and He pays for our sins.

864
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,720
 That's the gospel, that all of your sins went on Christ,

865
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,600
 that you don't have to pay for your sins in eternity

866
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,680
 because Jesus did.

867
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,200
 And you have the same inheritance as the spotless virgin,

868
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,800
 the lamb, the spotless lamb, the sinless Savior.

869
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,800
 You have the same inheritance as Him through the gospel

870
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,300
 by trusting in Christ, His death and resurrection,

871
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,640
 and He delights in forgiving you.

872
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,940
 No matter what you've done,

873
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,980
 no matter what kind of sexual abuse you've encountered,

874
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,100
 whether you've been abused or the abuser,

875
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,980
 He delights in restoring you.

876
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,340
 He delights in taking your mess and making it a message

877
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,500
 that you might use it to set others free.

878
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,920
 He purchased us misfits to be His brothers and sisters

879
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,420
 in His kingdom.

880
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,080
 Your body, it belongs to Him.

881
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,960
 And the goal this evening is not

882
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,360
 that you would simply not have sex.

883
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,840
 The goal is that you would honor Him

884
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,160
 in everything you do with your body

885
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,280
 and you're gonna need help.

886
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,780
 And so we're here to help you.

887
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,400
 I want you to come in here this Monday.

888
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,300
 There'll be over 1,000 people in this room.

889
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,480
 This Monday night at 6.30.

890
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,120
 It's a ministry we call Regeneration.

891
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,060
 And you know that as I've talked about porn,

892
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,400
 you've felt uncomfortably because you know last night

893
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,500
 or last week or last month,

894
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,880
 you went back to that website.

895
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,580
 You know the website, you know the app.

896
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,720
 You've been there, you've seen it,

897
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,300
 you've watched the videos, the clips,

898
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,440
 you've looked at the pictures.

899
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,840
 You know the kind of pornography that you like.

900
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,160
 You know your preference.

901
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,500
 And I'm talking to you, you need help.

902
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,380
 I've been there, you need help.

903
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,760
 And you're not gonna find restoration

904
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,240
 without pursuing help.

905
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,000
 And so you show up this Monday night at 6.30.

906
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,080
 You prioritize it.

907
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,000
 If you have plans, I cancel them.

908
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,440
 I would come in this room this Monday at 6.30.

909
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,280
 And some of you, you need to mark your calendar

910
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,560
 six to 12 months out.

911
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,340
 Go on your Microsoft Outlook.

912
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,140
 In six to 12 months, you write date again.

913
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,520
 And between now and then, you begin to incorporate

914
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,760
 a healthy study of God's word,

915
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,800
 a getting to know him, a daily prayer,

916
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,480
 community around you, belonging to a church,

917
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,480
 joining a church, becoming a member.

918
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,600
 Remake your life in those six to 12 months.

919
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,800
 Make Christ your greatest pursuit,

920
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,700
 that you would be stuck to him,

921
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,260
 that you would be united to him.

922
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:48,200
 Some of you, you need to confess your sexual sins.

923
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,760
 You need to do that tonight before you leave.

924
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,680
 You need to find someone with a black shirt on

925
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,840
 that says the porch Dallas.

926
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,680
 You need to go up to him and say,

927
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,640
 man, I gotta talk to you.

928
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,680
 You say, I gotta talk to you.

929
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,000
 They're gonna know what that means.

930
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,380
 And you just say, hey, I need help.

931
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,220
 Here's what's going on.

932
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,060
 Here's what I've done.

933
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,640
 Here's what I'm in the middle of.

934
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,880
 It's gonna take a lot of courage.

935
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,400
 It's gonna take some crazy courage.

936
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
 You're gonna feel like you can't utter those words.

937
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,240
 Listen, I just told thousands of you some of my junk.

938
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,440
 And I pray that that emboldens you to do the same,

939
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,720
 that you would go up to someone and say,

940
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,680
 hey, I need help.

941
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,980
 Others of you, you need to break up.

942
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,480
 You break up, get well, get back together.

943
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,040
 Don't try to do it together.

944
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,520
 Take some time apart.

945
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,120
 Say, hey, we need to pursue Jesus.

946
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,960
 I pray you do it before you leave the parking lot tonight.

947
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,360
 If it's a long distance relationship,

948
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,980
 call him and say, hey, I've got a date with Jesus.

949
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,980
 I need to push pause on this for a little while.

950
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,820
 And that's what you need.

951
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,400
 I'm not trying to make it awkward for you right now.

952
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,480
 I know it is.

953
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,260
 I love you.

954
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,260
 I want God's best for you.

955
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,480
 I want better than what you have for you.

956
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,100
 It's my only motive.

957
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,920
 God is not trying to rip you off.

958
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,140
 He wants to give you life

959
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,760
 so that you might have it abundantly.

960
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,920
 And that's what I want to do as I read his word over you.

961
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:16,040
 It's interesting that when they left with my car,

962
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,240
 I, you know, I scrambled.

963
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,500
 I mean, I was out thousands of dollars.

964
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,560
 Talked to an attorney friend.

965
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,200
 They said, hey, you can go to court and try to fight for it.

966
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,040
 So I did.

967
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,280
 I went to court and showed up.

968
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,920
 And judge says, hey, it's not your car.

969
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,420
 Couldn't argue with that.

970
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,560
 Even though I had paid for it, it belonged to somebody else.

971
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,820
 I said, okay.

972
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,160
 I left with my head hanging low

973
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,160
 and the insurance company called me.

974
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,400
 And I had insured it immediately upon purchase.

975
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,120
 And they said, hey, we're going to declare it a total loss.

976
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,300
 We're going to cover it.

977
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,840
 Which I had never expected.

978
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,600
 Cause I was just like, man, this is my foolishness.

979
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,880
 Like this was my stupidity.

980
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,540
 This was my mistake.

981
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,720
 I said, we'll cover it.

982
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,120
 That's what happened at the cross.

983
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,060
 Not that Christ is an insurance policy.

984
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,900
 He's not.

985
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,280
 And not that I would then go around.

986
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,000
 Oh, wow, insurance is going to cover this.

987
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,840
 I'm just going to go around buying stolen cars then.

988
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,040
 You know, that would be stupid.

989
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,760
 No, I thanked God for grace.

990
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,900
 I thanked him that he was no longer counting

991
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,320
 that sin against me.

992
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,480
 That I didn't have to pay for it any further with him.

993
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,440
 And I moved on and I was committed to being wiser.

994
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,400
 I was committed to doing things his way.

995
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,200
 That's what I want you to leave here with.

996
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,440
 Receive grace.

997
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,820
 You don't need to leave with shame.

998
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,120
 Shame is the voice of the enemy.

999
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,040
 Guilt is his language.

1000
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,520
 That's what he speaks.

1001
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,940
 Tell him right now, hey, shh.

1002
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,640
 Shh.

1003
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,840
 I received grace.

1004
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,320
 I've been an idiot.

1005
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,300
 Done some stupid things.

1006
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,040
 I played with things that didn't belong to me.

1007
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,920
 I looked at things that didn't belong to me.

1008
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,760
 I gave myself to things that were not mine.

1009
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,440
 God, I abused your daughters.

1010
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
 God, I abused your sons.

1011
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,760
 Thank you for grace.

1012
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,920
 Now would you restore me, give me courage to pursue healing?

1013
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,660
 That's what I want for you.

1014
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,200
 Do you not know your bodies are temples

1015
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,640
 of the Holy Spirit who is in you?

1016
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,280
 Whom you've received from God.

1017
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,400
 You are not your own.

1018
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,900
 You've been bought by a price.

1019
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,720
 Jesus, why not try before you buy?

1020
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,800
 Jesus didn't.

1021
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,040
 He didn't, he just committed.

1022
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,120
 He just committed.

1023
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,400
 He just committed, he just purchased you, man.

1024
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,560
 Gave his life to purchase you, bought you, set you free,

1025
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,600
 gave you eternity with him in his kingdom,

1026
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,600
 set you up an inheritance with him forever and ever

1027
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,120
 and ever in glory, no longer counting your sins against you.

1028
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,800
 It is to his delight that he forgives you.

1029
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,300
 Walk in that, man.

1030
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,280
 Would you walk in that and be free?

1031
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,760
 That's what I want you.

1032
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,960
 I want you to leave your junk in this room.

1033
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,000
 You leave your junk in this room,

1034
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,080
 you walk out those doors and you'd be free

1035
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,920
 and be new and stop, be set apart.

1036
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,960
 Don't do things the world ways.

1037
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,620
 Your crazy uncle is crazy, okay?

1038
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,640
 God has something better for you.

1039
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,640
 Father, would you show us

1040
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,800
 that you have something better for us?

1041
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,720
 Thank you for this amazing text.

1042
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,480
 Thank you for the freedom that you offer us.

1043
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,600
 Thank you for forgiveness,

1044
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,760
 the reality that your son paid it all,

1045
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,800
 that he paid it all.

1046
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,400
 There's nothing left for us to pay for.

1047
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,900
 The bill's been taken care of.

1048
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,280
 Help us to find that restoration,

1049
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,540
 that regeneration, that newness of life

1050
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,780
 in the name of your son, Jesus Christ, amen.

1051
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:12,780
