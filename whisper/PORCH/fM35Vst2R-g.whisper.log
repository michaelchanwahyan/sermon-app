[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   - Well, what's up porch?
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's great to see you tonight.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   I normally get to spend my Tuesday nights
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.640]   in Fort Worth, Texas,
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.860]   but I'm so excited to get to hang with you tonight
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.700]   here in Dallas.
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.760]   Hey, Houston, El Paso, Tulsa,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.720]   everybody else under the sun that's tuning in
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.600]   or under the moon since the days are getting shorter.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.760]   It's great to see everyone tonight.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.440]   Hey, we're gonna take a pause
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.240]   from our series First Comes Love.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.720]   No big deal, it's gonna come back next week.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.640]   But as we do, I wanna start by sharing with you
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.280]   that I went on my first fishing trip ever this last weekend.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.200]   Now, I grew up in small town.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.240]   Yes, way to go all seven of you who like to fish.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.560]   Well done.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.560]   This is your night, man.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.680]   So I went on my first fishing trip ever.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680]   Now, I grew up in Deep East, Texas, like small town.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.000]   And I don't know what to tell you.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.560]   Man, so I don't know what to tell,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.820]   where two or three are gathered, all right?
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.280]   So I don't know what to tell you besides,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.680]   the apple fell far from the tree, man.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.520]   I just don't fish.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.040]   My dad was a business guy and he coached baseball.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.860]   That was what we did.
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.720]   So we were always at the ball field.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.540]   We were never at the fishing pond.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.680]   And so, or river, or lake, or whatever it is.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.240]   And so, what happened was, I told,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.400]   these guys were like, hey,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600]   there's 12 guys on the Fort Worth team.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.560]   And he said, hey, we're gonna go do this.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.400]   I said, okay, great.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.220]   But you need to understand,
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.480]   I'm like basically a nine-year-old.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.160]   I mean, I have no idea what to do.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.720]   I'm gonna need some serious expertise.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.680]   I don't know what to buy.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.160]   I don't know anything for fishing.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.600]   I got my hands, like that's what I got.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.900]   And so, when you guys, and they're like,
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.320]   yes, we'll take care of you start to finish.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.640]   So we go through the store, we go to Academy.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.640]   There's a section for this.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.200]   Some of you knew, but some of you didn't.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   Huge section.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.240]   They're like, and there's these little bags for days.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's like half an acre of this stuff.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.120]   And they're walking by and they start speaking
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.600]   another language and a strong accent.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's like, yeah, we need to get them a little bit
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.920]   of blah, blah, blah, and we need to get them
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.120]   some of this and a little of this.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.960]   And they start handing me like all this stuff.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.200]   And I'm like, yeah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.040]   that's what I need.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.120]   And so, they start putting all this stuff in my arms.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.040]   I go and check out and we get to the river.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.720]   Now, you need to understand, this is way back country,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.320]   three days of not seeing another human soul
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.800]   except our group, and we are going to fish.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.520]   So I'm loaded up in my kayak and we're gonna go
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.600]   and I'm ready.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.880]   And there was a delightful redneck
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.160]   who took us to the spot to put in.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.360]   It was amazing.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.640]   And so, he put us in, all the kayaks go in,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.760]   all 12 at once.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.000]   And I start paddling.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.320]   I'm like, I wanna get to the good water.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.480]   I mean, I wanna get where no man has gone lately.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.160]   I mean, I wanna fish, I wanna pioneer this thing,
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.000]   tip of the spear.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.920]   And so, I go and start paddling as soon as I can
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.120]   to kind of put some distance between me
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.600]   and the rest of the guys.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.160]   And I threw, it makes a very satisfying little,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.640]   when you know when you cast it out there.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.600]   And so, it hits the water and I sat there and grew a beard.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.000]   I mean, nothing happened.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.240]   And I know what some of you are thinking.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.880]   You're like, oh, did you switch bait?
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.200]   Maybe you had the bait, you're supposed to move it.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.480]   Yes, I had five or six different kinds of bait.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.840]   I spent half of the next three days changing the bait.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.160]   I did it near the bank.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.280]   I cast it in the middle of the river.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.920]   I put it on the bottom of the river.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.880]   I put it near the top, kind of floating bait.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.720]   I tried all kinds of bait.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480]   I had red bait, white bait, blue bait.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   I had all kinds of bait.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.040]   And so, I'm just gonna save you an email.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   If you come down here after the message
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.080]   and you're like, hey man, I know what you did wrong.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.920]   We are going to fight.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.200]   I do not wanna hear,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.040]   because I'm telling you,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.720]   everybody knows the answer to the problem.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.120]   And so, I'm just telling you, it was a rough weekend.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.080]   At one point, I didn't catch any fish the whole day.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.840]   I bet I casted 500 times, no fish,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.400]   and this place is supposed to be an easy place
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   to catch fish.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.520]   And so, by the end of the second night,
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.360]   one of the guys,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.280]   one of the guys who had taken me through the store
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.840]   came up to me, said, Garrett, do you wanna catch a fish?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.120]   And I said, yes, I want to catch fish.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.360]   And so, he said, come on.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.000]   And so, we go down to the river.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.840]   It is nighttime.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.440]   He's got a headlamp on, okay?
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.120]   We're like to see, okay?
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.200]   People do this at night.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.240]   And so, he's got a headlamp on,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.840]   and we go down to his kayak,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.160]   where he has got Academy Sports and Outdoors in his kayak,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.800]   where he can give me anything that I need.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.240]   And he starts rigging up,
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.960]   and he does the other language thing again.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.800]   He's like, yeah, you need a little,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.960]   you know, a little this, a little that.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.040]   And then he pauses, and he goes,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.760]   this is how you fish with kids, by the way.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.880]   I'm like, oh, that's very encouraging.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.720]   Thank you.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.620]   And so, he starts rigging me up this deal,
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.280]   and he says, all right, go out there.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   And so, I walk out there into the leg-high water.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   It's nighttime.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.940]   I'm like, the joke is on me.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.780]   Are you kidding?
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.460]   I walk out there with his headlamp, and he goes,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.500]   oh yeah, this ain't gonna take long.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.340]   Chunk him out there.
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.460]   I'm like, yeah, sure, I'm not gonna, it's kind of,
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.420]   so boom, threw it out there, and grew my second beard.
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.280]   And nothing happened.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.220]   It just sat there the whole time.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.140]   It just sits there.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.060]   Nothing happened the entire weekend.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.140]   And so, here's what I wanna tell you about fishing.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.300]   Fishing is actually waiting.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.900]   Fishing is waiting and wondering what the fish want.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.940]   'Cause you don't know.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.200]   And at first, you don't really wonder what the fish want,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.840]   because that's what insane people do.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.760]   You don't wanna sit there and think,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   what do you want, fish?
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.020]   Instead, you just wanna fish.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.860]   But eventually, your patience starts to get worn down,
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.780]   and you're like, what do you want?
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.620]   What do you want from me?
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.180]   Do you want it closer to the surface?
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.220]   Do you want it farther down?
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.420]   What is it exactly that you want?
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.260]   I mean, are you guys down there like,
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260]   ah, it's Garrett's hook, ha ha, you know what I mean?
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.420]   What are you guys doing down there?
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.740]   Before you know it, I start to get vengeful.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.420]   I walk through the grocery store, you know,
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.260]   and there's the fish right there,
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.860]   and I'm like, ha ha, you know?
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.300]   We win, we win.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.540]   I cook you and eat you.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.460]   And so, before you know it,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.260]   you start asking yourself all these insane questions,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.240]   and you realize that fishing is waiting
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.020]   and wondering what the fish want.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.320]   And there's something else in life
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   that involves a lot of waiting and wondering.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.720]   And it is, that something else
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.280]   that involves a lot of waiting and wondering
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   is a relationship with someone you can't see, namely God.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.680]   When you're in a relationship with God,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.280]   you are in a relationship with someone that you cannot see
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.520]   and someone that you cannot control,
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.160]   which many of you have noticed.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.660]   You don't get to say what God does.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.140]   You don't get to decide what God does.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.300]   He gets to decide.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.300]   And at first, no matter how patiently,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.660]   you know, and you focus on it,
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.460]   just like I did with fishing, you know, you focus on it.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.580]   You're like, okay, this time,
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.980]   I'm gonna get the right study Bible,
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.540]   and I'm gonna get the right journal and pen,
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.740]   and I'm gonna get the right mentors,
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.820]   I'm gonna get the right coaching,
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.940]   and I am just going to be very, very patient.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.020]   But eventually, your patience wears down,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.740]   and you're left wondering the same kinds of questions.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.980]   What does God want?
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.020]   Eventually, you start going, okay, what do you want?
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.860]   What do you want?
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.680]   Is it me?
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   I mean, is something wrong with me?
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.940]   Is it 'cause I haven't read my Bible enough lately?
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.260]   Is that why you're not doing what I want?
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.620]   It seems like you're jumping around,
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.820]   which by the way, on the trip,
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.740]   fish were jumping around me, just not on the hook.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.540]   And it seems like, I mean, and you walk with God,
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.380]   you're going, okay, God,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.280]   it seems like you're doing good things for other people,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.560]   but I'm just waiting on you,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.520]   waiting for a better circumstance,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.220]   waiting for a better job,
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.300]   waiting for someone who is able to be convinced
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.560]   to spend the rest of their life with me.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.440]   I'm waiting on a parent to be healed.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.800]   I'm waiting on me to be healed.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   I'm waiting on a promotion.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.640]   I'm waiting on you to get me out of this financial ordeal.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.840]   And we wait and we wait and we wait.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.300]   And eventually, you just start wondering,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.480]   man, what's wrong with me?
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.600]   Is it because I pay more attention
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.820]   to fantasy football this week?
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.260]   Is it 'cause I signed up for Bumble?
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.440]   I mean, what's the deal?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.480]   God, is there something actually wrong with me?
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.020]   We wait and we wonder.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.580]   And if you're not careful, you end up getting frustrated.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.620]   And so what I wanna do tonight
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.120]   is I want you to see in the scripture
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.000]   with complete clarity what God wants.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.320]   That's what we're gonna spend our time on tonight,
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.640]   is what God wants.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.240]   Because in the scripture, God gets to speak for himself.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.440]   And so we can go straight to him
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.400]   to hear exactly what he wants.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.520]   And so what we're gonna do
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.560]   is we're gonna go to a parable that Jesus told.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.440]   Now, what's a parable?
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.520]   A parable is a short story
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.720]   that Jesus told to illustrate one point.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.240]   All right, it's a short made-up story
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.760]   that Jesus made up in order to illustrate
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.760]   something very important about God.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.560]   And in this story, which is found in Luke chapter 15,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.880]   you're gonna see that Jesus illustrates what God wants.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.280]   And specifically, you're gonna get introduced
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.280]   to a few people in this story,
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.560]   and you're gonna need to pay attention to them.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.720]   And so the three are, one, you're gonna meet a father
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.600]   who has two sons, and those two sons
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.240]   are the second and third characters in the story.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.160]   And now Luke is the third book of your New Testament.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.220]   So Matthew, Mark, Luke.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.280]   Luke is essentially a biography of Jesus.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.360]   And just to give you confidence,
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.840]   and to give me confidence tonight,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.440]   that Luke is a trustworthy source,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.720]   the more archeological discoveries that are made,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   the more time goes on.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.400]   Luke has proven himself over and over again
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.200]   to be one of the most reliable historians ever.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.840]   The book of Acts, he also wrote it,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.500]   which is, if you're tracking with us on Sundays
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.120]   here at Watermark, the book of Acts was written by Luke,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.560]   and he has incredible eye for detail.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.320]   The scripture says that he was a physician.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.920]   And so if you're a medical type,
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.120]   you know that detail is important.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.680]   And Luke is going to capture in detail
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.280]   exactly what Jesus wanted to express to us
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.000]   about what God wants.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.280]   You'll see three acts as we go.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.120]   The story develops.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   That's the fun part about a story,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.920]   is there's some tension and some development to it.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.120]   And so there are three acts in that story,
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.920]   and we're gonna pause after each one
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.880]   and draw attention to it.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.080]   And so let's get to the text.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.360]   This is a very famous story, by the way.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.840]   Some of you have heard this before,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.920]   and some of you are gonna get to enjoy this
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.880]   for the first time.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.480]   Luke 15, verse 11.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.780]   Jesus said, "There was a man who had two sons,
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.560]   "and the younger of them said to his father,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.840]   "Father, give me the share of property
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.720]   "that is coming to me."
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.200]   And he divided his property between them.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.720]   You should know up front, the father represents God.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.640]   And this younger son comes up to him and says,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.800]   "Father, give me the share of property
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.640]   "that is coming to me."
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.420]   What he's doing is he's doing a big no-no.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.760]   You need to know how offensive this is.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.680]   He is asking for his inheritance early.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.020]   He's going to his dad and he's saying,
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.200]   "Hey, I know how this works.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.000]   "When you die, I get money.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.680]   "And so can we just pretend that's already happened?
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.620]   "You be dead to me.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.580]   "I'm gonna remove myself from this house.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.120]   "You're not my dad functionally anymore for sure.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.360]   "And I would love to take the wealth
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.600]   "that you have accrued through your hard work,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.480]   "and I would like to go and do whatever I want with it."
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.360]   And so this breaks any father's heart.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.720]   No dad wants to hear this.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.160]   No good dad wants to hear this.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.240]   And this is exactly what he does.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.800]   He used his father to get what he really wanted
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.580]   'cause he didn't want his father.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.480]   This is heartbreaking for anyone.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.880]   And so the first act kind of unfolds quickly.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.120]   It's worth knowing that God wants you to want him
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.380]   more than what he can give you.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.640]   God wants you to want him.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.840]   If he's a father, and the father in the story
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.240]   represents God the father.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.480]   And if he's a loving father, then he wants you,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.800]   if he's in it for the relationship,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.220]   then any father who's really in it for the relationship
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.400]   doesn't just wanna provide, he wants to have relationship.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.640]   And I'm sad to say that this is where we get
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.840]   to see ourselves in the story,
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.520]   which is why the story is so gripping.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.440]   Because every one of us to some degree or another,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.600]   self-included, have made this deal with God.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.440]   I'm sad to say that I made this deal with God.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.280]   I didn't say it in these terms.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.760]   I don't even think I said it consciously, but I knew.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.600]   See, I grew up in church.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.800]   I was churched a little bit at least.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.680]   And I knew what was right, I knew what was wrong.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.880]   And I knew, I had heard of the goodness of God.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.300]   And I said, I think I know what is good,
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.140]   and I'm gonna go get it.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.080]   So I essentially in my heart said to God,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.340]   God, I don't want you, I'll just go have sex
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.480]   with your daughters, whoever I want.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.520]   God, I don't want you, but your food is pretty good.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.880]   God, I don't want you, but I'd love to have a lot
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.680]   of your creation so that I can be rich
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.320]   and I can feel like I'm managing a lot.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.480]   God, I don't wanna worship you, I wanna worship,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.240]   but I like it when your people worship me.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.440]   Every one of us have made this deal with God.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.440]   And no father wants it and God does not want it.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.360]   He wants us to want him more than what he can offer us
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.700]   because he's in it for the relationship.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.800]   But here's the thing, he won't force it.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.280]   God didn't keep any prisoners.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.560]   The door is wide open and this kid took it.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.640]   And so it says in verse 13, not many days later,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.940]   the younger son did what sons do
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.860]   when they got daddy's money,
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.640]   but they don't care about daddy's wishes.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.260]   It says he gathered all he had
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.720]   and he took a journey into a far country.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.140]   And there he squandered his property in reckless living.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.360]   Now we find out later in the story
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.080]   that he didn't kind of party.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.400]   When you see reckless living,
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.920]   you need to know what that means.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.200]   It doesn't mean, you know, he went and had one too many.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.640]   It means he threw some ragers, okay?
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.240]   It says later in the scripture,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.060]   it says that he devoured the property with prostitutes.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.620]   So whatever money can buy, that's what he bought.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.200]   And don't you know that when someone with that kind of money
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.320]   and with that kind of influence is the new kid in town
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.960]   and the new kid in town has got money
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.160]   and he's got a taste for the party,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.420]   you make friends kind of fast.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.000]   So you can bet wherever he landed,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.720]   he ended up being right in the middle of it.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   He's the new great Gatsby that just came to town
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.880]   throwing the huge parties.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.240]   Everybody wants to be a part of it
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.280]   and it is reckless living.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.200]   But here's the thing,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.600]   when you spend your wealth in that way
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.160]   and you spend your time in that way,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.440]   eventually it runs out.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   The money runs out, the music stops, the friends leave,
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.560]   and there's nothing but a wasteland there.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   It says when he had spent everything,
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.800]   a severe famine arose in that country
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.760]   and he began to be in need.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.280]   We don't know if years went by, maybe a long time went by,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.800]   but it says he began to be in need.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.300]   So he went and hired himself out
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.040]   to one of the citizens of that country
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.920]   who sent him into his field to feed pigs.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.680]   Now that's low work for anybody,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.080]   but you need to know for a Jewish young man,
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.160]   a national identity to him was very important.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.640]   And to be working for someone who was not an Israelite,
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.560]   working for someone who was not Jewish
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   was the ultimate insult.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.720]   On top of that, pigs were considered to be
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.000]   the most filthy, dirty, inedible animal to be around.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.240]   You would be religiously unclean to be around pigs.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.640]   And here he is working for someone
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.240]   who is not one of God's people and he's feeding pigs.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.480]   And it gets worse, verse 16.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.160]   He was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.320]   and no one gave him anything.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.160]   He's begging and he's not even begging for human food.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.240]   He's begging for pig food.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.280]   That's what he wants.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.560]   And some parties land with a louder thud than others,
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.680]   but all parties land with a thud.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   If you've ever been to a party
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.080]   and seen it the next morning,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   you know it's not the scene of festivity
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.760]   and it's not the scene of fun.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.680]   There's empty food containers, empty pizza boxes,
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.760]   there's empty beer bottles.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.640]   Some poor soul may still be there asleep,
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.580]   about to wake up realizing what's going on.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.600]   And it's just an absolute wasteland.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.540]   And what used to be the place where people were gathering
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.080]   is now the farthest place that people wanna be from.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.840]   And that's where he found himself.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.520]   He woke up hungry, broke and alone.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.600]   And that is eventually what happens
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.520]   when you party your life away.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.360]   I've tried that.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.320]   And finally, he does the first sane thinking
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.200]   that he's done in a long time.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.000]   It says, "But when he came to himself, he said,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.040]   "How many of my father's hired servants?"
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.440]   These guys just work for my dad.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.520]   They're not even the sons.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.440]   They're just not even my brothers.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.880]   They just work for dad.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.740]   "How many of my father's hired servants
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.140]   "have more than enough bread,
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.360]   "but I'm perishing here with hunger.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.560]   "I'm about to die of starvation because I left dad.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.000]   "I will arise and go to my father and I will say."
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.240]   Now, I love what he does next.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.140]   You ever done something wrong
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.520]   and you knew you're gonna have to face dad?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.820]   You remember these days?
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.200]   Like, you know you're gonna have to face dad.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.800]   And all of a sudden you are a professional speech writer.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.400]   You're like, "Listen, dad, here's what had happened.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.560]   "Before you say anything, let me just say.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.200]   "Before you do that, let me just explain."
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.100]   And we all of a sudden, we get very creative.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.560]   And so we just kind of build and build.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.680]   This is just common to humanity.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.880]   It was going on 2000 years ago.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.740]   It's going on today.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.200]   When you're about to have to face dad,
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.960]   you get pretty creative about what you're about to say.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.420]   And he writes a pretty decent speech.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.260]   I will give him that.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.940]   So look here, it says, "I will say to him,
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.320]   "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,"
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.360]   which is absolutely true.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.680]   "I am no longer worthy to be called your son,"
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.400]   which is also true.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.200]   By choice, he chose that.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.300]   And then he comes up with a little idea.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.400]   "Treat me as one of your hired servants.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.200]   "Just take me back as somebody who can work for you.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.720]   "Don't even have to call me a son.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.620]   "I'll change my last name.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.700]   "I don't care, I just need to eat.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.560]   "I'll work, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.320]   "Just let me on the property."
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.040]   And he arose and came to his father.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.160]   Now pause right there.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.100]   I want you to think about years of being gone.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.760]   You haven't laid eyes on your dad or your brother
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.240]   or the servants or the extended family in a long, long time.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.020]   And you don't know how they're gonna receive you
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.860]   because guess what?
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.120]   They know what you've been doing
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.520]   and it doesn't make daddy proud nor anyone else.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.040]   And so now you're about to walk back home
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.600]   because this is not, you don't catch an Uber,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.360]   you're walking, okay, long time ago.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.240]   And so you're walking and every step,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.760]   you've got a chance to think about what's been going on.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.840]   You've got a replay going of everything you've done.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.140]   Some of you had this negative replay
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.680]   of the low lights of your life.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.360]   And he's walking home and he's got that going.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.760]   He's going, "Okay, I got nothing but the speech.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.200]   "That's all I've got.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.460]   "And I've got dad's reaction and I have no idea
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.540]   "what it's gonna be."
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:59.900]   And if you don't know why God is worth singing to
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.460]   and about not just on Tuesdays, but every day,
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.760]   you are about to find out.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:10.500]   It says, "But while he was still a long way off,"
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.920]   so dad's looking, he's waiting.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.480]   "While he was still a long way off,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.460]   "his father saw him and felt murderous."
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.580]   No, that's not what it says.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.400]   "His father saw him and felt compassion.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.480]   "And he ran and embraced him and kissed him."
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.280]   This is so shocking.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.560]   This is crazy.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.140]   This is insane for lots of reasons.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.800]   Number one, old men in this culture don't run, okay?
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.140]   It's a respect thing, all right?
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.820]   You earned a right, you put it on cruise control.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.420]   All right, you do not have to run.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.720]   But this man is running, okay?
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.020]   Second, men in this culture happen to wear
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.840]   what we would commonly call a dress, okay?
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.560]   So they would call it a tunic or a cloak
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.320]   or something like that, but it's one piece, man.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.920]   And so never put one on,
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.800]   but I'm assuming it's not easy to run in.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.720]   And so he is all of that.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.260]   You've ever seen an old man running a skirt?
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.400]   I mean, everybody's watching.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.200]   And so he is so excited to see his son
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.720]   and he is moving towards him.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.520]   And now if you're him, you're like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.360]   I don't know about you guys.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.320]   I had a fantastic dad, but he was intense.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.500]   And if I had messed up,
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.760]   there was some intensity about that.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.020]   And so if I had done this and I was coming home
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.780]   and all of a sudden dad's getting bigger in the windshield,
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.380]   I'm running, I'm like, I'm out.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.420]   I don't want anything to do
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.860]   with whatever he's about to do to me.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.500]   And it says, but when he got there, it's a hug.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.340]   What?
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.280]   He embraced him and kissed him.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.140]   And in shock, because everybody's in shock.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.140]   I mean, if you're watching, you're like,
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.780]   this is a drive by, this is a sprint by punch in the mouth.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.020]   That's what this is about to be.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.420]   And it says, the son said to him, it's like,
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.260]   "What do I do?
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.100]   I don't know what to do.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:42.920]   I guess I'll play role on the speech.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.760]   So here we go.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.080]   Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.300]   I am no longer worthy to be called your son."
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.860]   And you might notice that the speech
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.480]   doesn't even get finished because the father interrupts.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.200]   But the father said to his servants,
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.340]   "Bring quickly the best robe."
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.740]   What?
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.980]   Bring him the best robe?
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.460]   Did you say quickly punch him in the nose?
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.380]   Is that what you said?
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.140]   No, it says quickly bring him the best robe we've got.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.420]   Whatever the best garment is that we have in the house,
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.660]   I want you to bring it out here
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.840]   and I want you to put it on him.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.620]   It's like, hey son, glad you're back.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.460]   What was it you're saying?
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.820]   It's not important what you have to say.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.720]   Here's what I have to say.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.660]   Get the best thing that we have
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.360]   and put it on him right now.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.500]   And then it says, put a ring on his hand,
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.540]   which is a symbol of being in the family,
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.700]   a symbol of being a part of this group
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.480]   and a symbol of restored wealth.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.820]   And it put shoes on his feet, get guys dirty.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.100]   Don't you know he's just nasty, smells bad, he's dirty.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.940]   Put shoes on his feet.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.940]   And then it says, and bring the fattened calf and kill it.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.900]   Now listen, if you're a vegetarian,
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.340]   I got nothing for you right here.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.300]   My wife and I's birthdays are both in the same month.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.620]   And in that month, we always go and have the fattened calf
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.740]   and have some really good steak.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.980]   It is fantastic.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.340]   And my friends, it's in October.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.580]   I'm already thinking about it.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.660]   All right, it's coming up.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.360]   And so the fattened calf is a symbol of a special occasion.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.940]   It's when you eat good.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.220]   It's what you've been waiting for.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.580]   And spontaneously, the dad just says,
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.340]   "Hey, we are about to have a party.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.860]   "We're about to eat and celebrate."
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.700]   Why?
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.300]   "For this son of mine was dead and he's alive again.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.460]   "He was lost and now he's found."
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.860]   And they began to celebrate.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.140]   And don't you know the father knew everything
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.460]   that had been going on?
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.540]   People talk, man.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.100]   People talk now, they talk back then.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.400]   He knew what was going on.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.740]   But he still valued the fact that his son was just home
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.780]   more than what his son had been doing.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.420]   And so as act two draws to a close,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   you find out that God wants your presence
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.380]   despite your past.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.760]   It might be the best news you've ever heard.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.680]   God wants your presence near him,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.040]   despite where you've been.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.020]   For God, it's about where you are today, near him.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.380]   And there's something inside of all of us
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.580]   that just wants to reject that.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.740]   It's like, there's no way, not me, somebody else.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.160]   Maybe the person on the other section.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.020]   Maybe the person on the other row.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.420]   Maybe the person right beside me.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.940]   Maybe me if I hadn't gone quite so far.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.000]   And we try to talk ourselves out of this.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.500]   The point of Jesus's story is that this guy went as far
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.640]   as a human being could go.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.480]   Do you understand?
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.540]   You are in bounds.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.360]   God wants your presence despite your past.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.700]   That's the goodness of God.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.960]   And my favorite part of the story is actually still ahead.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.180]   Act three.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.380]   And a lot of people stop right there
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.460]   because that's a stopping point.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.660]   I mean, could we not pause right there
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.660]   and just bring the guys back up
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.580]   and we're singing and worshiping in response to that?
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.680]   I mean, that's enough.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.500]   But there happens to be another part
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.140]   where the heart of humanity and the heart of God
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.440]   is explained even further.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:49.460]   Verse 25, it says, "Now his older son,"
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.760]   you remember this man had two sons.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.460]   "Now his older son was in the field.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.060]   "And as he came and drew near to the house,
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.560]   "he heard music and dancing.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.200]   "And he called one of the servants
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.060]   "and asked what these things meant."
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.880]   What is going on?
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.040]   Last I checked, that doesn't just throw random parties.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.240]   "And the servant said to him,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   "Your brother has come and your father has killed him.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.100]   "No, your father has killed the fattened calf
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.400]   "because he received him back safe and sound."
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.500]   There's so much broken here.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.480]   "But he was angry and refused to go in.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.620]   "His father came out," here's the goodness of God,
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.500]   "and then treated him."
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.860]   Could have just let him pout outside.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.700]   I don't know about in your house,
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.220]   but if I pouted, that was like being cut off
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.740]   from your people, nobody pouts.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.660]   "But God, in his kindness," he says,
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.900]   "the father comes out and entreats him,
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.160]   "implores him, asks him to come inside.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.080]   "But he answered his father,
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.700]   "'Look, these many years I have served you,
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.380]   "'and I never disobeyed your command.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.220]   "'Yet you never gave me a young goat
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.980]   "'that I might celebrate with my friends.'"
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.140]   Now there's something you never complain to your dad about.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.180]   Dad, where's the young goat, man?
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.740]   My friends and I wanna celebrate.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.840]   The young goat represents even a little bit of a reward.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.260]   "But when this son of yours came
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.440]   "who devoured your property with prostitutes,
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.880]   "you killed the filet mignon for him."
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.540]   What's the deal?
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.820]   And there is so much wrong there.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:17.900]   He's competitive, he's angry,
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.540]   he's just a party pooper in general.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.620]   But here's the deepest, darkest secret of all
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.020]   that just came out.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.740]   He stayed home, but he didn't love the father,
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.540]   not any more than the other son had.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.260]   He didn't love the father.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.540]   He didn't like being near him.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.420]   In fact, he wanted the same thing the younger son did,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.020]   stuff, his own goodness.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.500]   You could say the younger son was lost in his own badness,
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.860]   and the older son was lost in his own goodness.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:52.340]   In your Bible, the parable is probably called
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.500]   the parable of the lost son.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.800]   It should be called the parable of the lost sons.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.200]   Because one of these kids left home,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.600]   but they were both far away.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.980]   Because the man who stayed home
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.900]   did not enjoy being around God.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.560]   He was a self-righteous person.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.700]   I'm sad to say this represents
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.340]   the self-righteous churchgoer.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.340]   The self-righteous person who says,
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.020]   "You know what, I'm gonna, I wanna sin.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.700]   "I mean, just like the younger brother wanted to sin,
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.680]   "I mean, I want the same thing, but you know what?
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.600]   "Instead of just saying yes, like he did,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.700]   "I'll say no for the wrong reason.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.520]   "Like I'll watch him do it, but I'll say no, I won't sin,
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.980]   "just so I can feel clean.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.100]   "Just so I can feel a little relatively better.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.880]   "Just so I can feel like I'm a better person.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.600]   "Just so I can keep up my projection
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.740]   "and false idea of myself as a righteous person."
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.840]   There's nothing fundamentally different
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.000]   about what they wanted.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.800]   Neither of them loved God.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.000]   Neither of them loved the Father, that is to say.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.900]   And I'm sad to say that that is where many, many,
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.080]   many people who have been in church for decades,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.920]   I'm afraid, live, near God, close to God,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.480]   in God's house, in the meetings, in the services,
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.680]   at the porches, in the podcasts, in the book even.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.960]   But there is no love for God.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:14.400]   And that's why the story is so powerful,
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.900]   because the two sons encompass all of humanity.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.960]   If you can hear my voice right now,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.660]   you're some mix of these two guys.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.060]   Because you love something other than God, just like me.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.760]   You love something other than God.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.140]   And in neutral, you'll decide either just to give in
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.340]   to that desire or say no to it and be proud that you did.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.900]   And both of them will take you away from the Father.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:44.300]   And listen to how relational the Father is.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.980]   If you are that self-righteous person,
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.300]   if you're the person who says, "You know what?
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.560]   "I am not the typical North Dallas young adult.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.660]   "I didn't go off and party.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.320]   "And I don't live in this place.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.180]   "And I don't go to these places and blah, blah, blah."
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.220]   And that's your pride.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.180]   I wanna tell you, God has a kind word for you.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.460]   Verse 31, "He said to him,
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.060]   "Son, you're always with me."
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.180]   Didn't you remember that's what this whole thing is about?
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.400]   "You're with me.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.620]   "And all that's mine is yours anyway.
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.160]   "It was fitting to be celebrated and be glad.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.620]   "For now your brother who was dead is now alive.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.800]   "He was lost and is found.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.380]   "Don't you see, son, I want your devotion.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.680]   "I don't want your achievement.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.120]   "I know your younger brother was a screw up.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.660]   "But the fact that you're doing better
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.720]   "doesn't achieve your way into good grace, man."
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.460]   The Father wants devotion.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.280]   The Father wants relationship.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.180]   Any good father doesn't want just accomplishment.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.240]   He doesn't want hollow compliance.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.740]   He wants the heart of his children, both of 'em.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.800]   So at the end of Act Three,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.300]   you find that God wants your devotion,
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.420]   not your achievements.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.340]   God's not looking for your hollow Christian achievement.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.260]   He's not looking for the verse
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.900]   you memorized a long time ago or even last week,
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.200]   unless it stirs your affections for him.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.460]   God is not trying to tell you to behave, people.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.620]   He wants to be with you.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.700]   He wants to be with you.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.380]   He doesn't want the older son to sit there and behave.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.380]   He's not saying, "Hey, behave.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.220]   "Hey, behave, behave."
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.780]   He's saying, "I wanna be with you."
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.520]   He's intensely relational.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.820]   And it is a shame to live close to him and not know.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.500]   It is a shame to live close to God
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.700]   and be just more into good than into God,
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.800]   to be moralistic and to be empty,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.600]   just so you can feel good about you.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.100]   So I just wanna close by asking you, which son are you?
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.860]   Which son are you?
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.520]   Maybe a mix of the two.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.460]   I know I've woken up and been discouraged
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.480]   to find both sons alive and well in me.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.660]   I just wanna ask you, which son are you?
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.540]   Are you a way?
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.700]   For some of you, Dallas is a way.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.220]   You moved away and you've done some things
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.400]   that if dad heard, it would not be good.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.740]   But the real dad that counts, man, he knows.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.940]   He is aware of what you came to this city to do.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.100]   He's aware of what you are currently doing.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.740]   And he's not chasing you down to harm you.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.460]   He's ready to receive you.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.700]   He wants to be reunited with you.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.460]   This reunion could be waiting on you right now.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.060]   And so if you're the lost son, I wanna tell you,
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.940]   if you're the physically far away son
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.620]   and you know you're just giving up to your sin,
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.860]   you know you just said yes to it,
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.300]   and you totally left God behind,
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.140]   I wanna tell you, God is waiting for you.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.740]   He wants to be reunited with you.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.660]   He wants to be with you.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.260]   And if you're the son who is at home,
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.060]   but somehow you forgot that God's not keeping
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.380]   a scorecard on you and you shouldn't be
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.700]   keeping a scorecard on yourself,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.780]   somehow you forgot that better is one day in his courts
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.660]   than a thousand elsewhere, and somehow you missed that fact
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.020]   and you slipped into moralism
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.660]   that doesn't have anything to do with your heart.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.480]   You need to know God's interested in being with you,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.300]   and he's glad you're home.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.820]   He's not saying, well, might as well go party
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.640]   if you're not gonna love me.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.060]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.300]   He's saying, be with me.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.860]   If you're gonna be here, be with me.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.540]   If you're gonna be engaged in the local church,
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.360]   if you're gonna be, if you're gonna count yourself
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.220]   a follower of Christ, be with me 100%.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.660]   I love this story because it involves two brothers.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.500]   And I grew up with an older brother,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.260]   and I'd love to close it tonight by telling you about him.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.260]   He and I grew up rebelling together, if you will.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.740]   So we kind of slept through the same Sunday school.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.400]   And we did the wrong things, man.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.380]   We did a few of the wrong things.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.820]   We drank the wrong things, we smoked the wrong things,
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.700]   then we smoked the other wrong things,
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.900]   and we decided to steal my mother's car one night together,
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.620]   and then we got pulled over by the police at 4.30 a.m.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.580]   Together, this is before I was a believer in Christ,
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.260]   neither of us were, and we were both pretty lost.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.200]   And we had heard things like this,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.700]   but it didn't matter to us.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.980]   We wanted to be a way.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.780]   That's what we wanted to do.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.460]   And something happened that changed that for me.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.380]   The night before I went to college,
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:59.380]   I walked in to a church for some strange reason.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.840]   And as I walked in, I heard a communicator
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.740]   communicate the love of God and the desire of God for me.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.700]   And I found out the answer to that question
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.220]   that we started with tonight, what does God want?
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.180]   The answer is you, you, first name, last name, you.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.020]   That's what he wants.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.940]   And that came over me, and that started to change my life
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.180]   from the inside out.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.300]   And so what happened all of a sudden,
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.500]   when I was 18 and my brother was 21,
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.160]   our paths started to diverge a little bit
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.940]   because I wanted to be around the Father.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.820]   And now for my brother, he looked at me and he thought,
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.160]   you know what, he must have gotten some shot of religion.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.280]   You know, he must have woke up and he must have woken up
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.020]   and like grew a conscience.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.980]   You know, maybe he just kind of got indoctrinated
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.040]   and now, you know, he was always a little better, you know.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.800]   So maybe he just wants to double down on being better.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.820]   And I'm telling you, that is not what happened.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.100]   And I would try to tell him in return,
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.620]   I would say, you don't understand, bro.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.800]   The goodness of God, the fact that God wants me
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.220]   and wants you is so real.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.860]   You have no idea how good he is.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.520]   And he just wasn't interested, wasn't interested.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.660]   Well, a year later, our mother passed away.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.540]   And as that happened, I was so convinced that God wanted me,
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.340]   despite the chaos of my life,
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.340]   and despite the fact that I had been the lost son
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.020]   who went away a long way.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.900]   And the fact that he wanted me just took such a grip on me
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.700]   that even that hardship drew me closer to God.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.700]   But that hardship, because my brother could not see
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.420]   that God wanted him through that chaos,
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.740]   it pushed him even farther away.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.640]   And what started out as adolescent partying
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.320]   went into full-blown adult alcoholism.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.900]   And the week night or the weekday adventures
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.800]   kind of turned into weeknight reality.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.340]   It just became normal.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.380]   And he became more and more confused, more and more angry,
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.060]   more and more frustrated at God,
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.680]   and more and more convinced that somehow
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.800]   I had just woken up and decided to behave.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.320]   And I told him over and over again, several times.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.420]   One night he called me on the phone.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.600]   He flew to Vegas to party by himself.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.380]   This is where this ends, by the way,
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.020]   if this is how you feel your life spiraling out of control.
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.960]   It doesn't go well.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.200]   He called me from Vegas,
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.680]   and he was about to go party by himself.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.440]   And I said, "Man, why don't you just fly home?
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.280]   "Why don't we just hang out?
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.120]   "Let's talk some more, man."
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.520]   So I talked to him on the phone for about an hour.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.540]   And he said, "There's no justice."
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.060]   He was confused by the world around him.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.300]   He was angry at the world around him,
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.440]   and he raged against the world around him.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.000]   And he just thought there was no justice in the world.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.580]   How could our mom die while there are criminals
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.660]   that are thriving millionaires?
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.340]   I mean, how could this happen?
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.640]   And I tried to tell him, I said,
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.520]   "Buddy, it's the chaos of the world.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.360]   "It's not God.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.180]   "God wants you.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.020]   "He's calling for you.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.880]   "He's reaching out, he's reaching out."
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.000]   And our paths continued to diverge.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.060]   And about two years ago, I got a phone call.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.820]   I was in the Ridgely Theater in Fort Worth
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.260]   on a Sunday morning, and I got a phone call
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.000]   that he didn't make it.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.940]   That's the phone call I woke up to
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.200]   on Sunday morning while I was in church.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.040]   And you hear something like that,
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.460]   and you hope it's not true.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.260]   And so they told me they were at a hospital.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.500]   And so I went to a hospital in North Dallas,
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.340]   and he, far North Dallas,
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.340]   and he had hit a telephone pole on his four-wheeler
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.420]   at 10 in the morning.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.780]   And they didn't know why.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.420]   They didn't know if he had been drinking or not.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.380]   It seemed likely, but we weren't sure.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.660]   We didn't know what kind of intent
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.960]   or what was mentally going on
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.660]   in his life or heart that morning.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.780]   But I walked into a hospital room,
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.420]   and when there's nobody in the hospital room,
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.640]   it means it's over.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.360]   And I walked in, and it was him.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.300]   And he was dead.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.980]   And it was real, really real.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:40.740]   And five days later, I stood up at the front
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.580]   with him.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.980]   He was right there in the casket.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.940]   I was in the front, suits on, you know.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.740]   And I looked at our family and friends,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.780]   and I said, "Guys, I'm gonna say
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.680]   "the most encouraging thing I can say.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.540]   "He had heard that God wanted him.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.480]   "He heard, he knew.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.700]   "And what we can do is we can hope
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.120]   "that that penetrated his heart
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.380]   "in a way that we never saw.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.780]   "And we can trust God, because we know that God wants him
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.980]   "even more than we do."
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.020]   But I know this, if he was here right now,
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.460]   he would tell you that God wants you.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.980]   He would tell you that God's priority
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.180]   in the universe is you.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.340]   He would tell you that Jesus Christ lived a perfect life
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:29.140]   and died a painful death and rose again from the grave
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.220]   so that the chaos of the world can make sense to you.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.500]   And that the pain of what you're going through
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.580]   can make sense to you.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:41.540]   And the whole existence I never understood
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.900]   was that God was after me.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.140]   That's what he would say.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.500]   And that's what I'm here to tell you.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.780]   I invited him to this room years ago and consistently.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.800]   I wanted him here.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.420]   But here's the deal.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.260]   You're here.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.860]   You get to hear God wants you.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.580]   You get to hear God desires you.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.260]   And I don't know what you came into the room
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.380]   thinking God wants from you.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.620]   Maybe you thought he doesn't care.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.020]   Maybe you thought he wants you to suffer.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.820]   Maybe you thought he wants to pay you back for something.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.060]   But the truth is God loves you.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.220]   He wants you.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.740]   He is after you with passion and with ferocity
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.780]   and with focus and with a want that you could never
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.540]   even dream up for another human being.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.420]   That is how God is after you.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.540]   And you aren't waiting on him, by the way.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.620]   As much as he's waiting on you to want him.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.840]   More than what you thought you were waiting on.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.980]   So I wanna tell you, if you're more into good
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.980]   than into God, you're wasting your life.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.500]   And I'm telling you, I hope you didn't miss anything.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.540]   I hope you didn't miss, I hope you didn't misunderstand
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.020]   me and think that I think that I'm better
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.060]   or I think that I did good.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.620]   If you didn't miss it, I'm telling you,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.740]   the only reason I'm here is 'cause one little idea
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.220]   got lodged in my head.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.060]   It's the idea that God loved and wanted.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.980]   And God loved and wanted me.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.580]   That's the only reason I'm here.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.860]   And I'm telling you, if you don't believe God wants you,
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.580]   the end of your life has already started.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.140]   But if you know that God wants you
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.540]   and you know that he desires you
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.020]   and you know that he can turn this thing around no problem,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.260]   then whether you are in heaven or on earth,
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.340]   you are with him.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.780]   And that is better than being any other place.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.940]   Let's pray together.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.580]   Thank you for sending your son
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.820]   to take the form of a servant,
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:43.660]   to pursue us and make a statement of your love to us
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.100]   that we can know your love for us.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.940]   Thank you that you wrote the words.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.060]   By this we'll know your love.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.100]   By this you demonstrate your love
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.460]   that while we were sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.060]   There's not a one of us in here that is good, God,
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.020]   and we know that.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.900]   God, both of our strategies ran dry a long time ago.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.460]   The desire to go off and do what we want
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.140]   and the desire to stay home and pretend we're good,
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.620]   they're both dead ends, God, and we confess it
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.860]   and we welcome you.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.340]   Thank you for your entreaty of us.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.820]   Thank you for your love and pursuit of us.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.300]   You could have just let us go,
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.540]   but you desire us in a way
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.340]   that changes us from the inside out
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.580]   and it preserves life,
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.700]   not just eternally, but right now.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.980]   And God, for any human being in this room,
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.780]   any human being in these rooms,
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.300]   any human being who is connected to us in any way,
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.620]   God, if they don't know what it's like
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.220]   to have that reunion,
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.980]   if they don't know what it's like to feel that embrace, God,
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.340]   I pray that they would just feel that wash over them
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.220]   in these very moments,
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.300]   because you're glad to see us
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.780]   despite the mess that we're wearing.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.980]   We love you for it and we thank you for it.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.480]   for it, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
