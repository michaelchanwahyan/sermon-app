[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:27.540]   Love it.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.460]   Hello friends in the room, hello friends in Fort Worth
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.780]   and in Houston, I'm gonna start with a story
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.340]   that'll kind of give us traction for where we're going.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.740]   A couple weeks ago on a Tuesday,
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.020]   we had our staff play day, Watermark, as a staff,
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.820]   once a year does like a play day where we go out
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.660]   and do some sort of game or team bonding,
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.580]   staff-wide competition together.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.740]   And on that day we had a great day,
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.900]   we did this like bow and arrow, Hunger Games,
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.540]   essentially thing as a staff, and had a ton of fun.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.460]   It was a great Tuesday.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.340]   We then had the porch that night.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.140]   The porch was awesome, it was Adam and Eve,
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.920]   JP kicked it off talking about,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.860]   or kicked off the BC series talking about Adam and Eve
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.740]   and it was just an awesome night.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.700]   Finished the porch, head home at like 10.30,
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.420]   end up getting ready for bed,
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380]   kissing my wife, we're going to bed, it's 11.15
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.660]   and I get a text message from our senior pastor,
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.420]   Todd Wagner, and it says, "Hey, are you up?
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.740]   "If so, call me."
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980]   And immediately I'm thinking like,
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.780]   oh my God, well, I'm up now, okay?
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.220]   And this would be like your CEO, your boss's boss,
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.340]   texting you late at night, be like,
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.460]   hey, can we talk right now?
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.700]   At 11.15, so this is very unusual,
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.340]   never happened before, unusual,
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.380]   and I'm like, oh my gosh, what could be possibly going on?
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380]   Do I, what do I do now?
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.260]   Do I act like, oh, I'm asleep, or do I respond?
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.660]   And I've started the dots, so he knows that I'm awake.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.500]   And so I call him and I'm like, hey man, what's going on?
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.020]   And I'm waiting to see like,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.820]   what could this possibly be about?
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.300]   It's 11.15 at night.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.500]   And he begins to like start small talk,
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.780]   he's like, hey, how was the porch tonight?
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.100]   And I'm like, it was great, I'm sure this is not
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.060]   why you wanna talk on the phone right now.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.800]   It was great, it was an awesome night,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360]   and tell him what went down, and he goes,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.380]   oh, that's great, man.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.980]   Hey, tell me, how old are you when your parents split up?
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.900]   And I'm thinking, what, where is this going right now?
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.220]   What are you asking me about?
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.540]   Am I delusional right now?
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.060]   And I answer, well, and he refers to part of my story
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.580]   is my parents divorced when I was 12.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.780]   And I said, well, that's kind of hard to answer,
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.660]   'cause they divorced officially when I was 12 years old,
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.660]   and they split up a little bit back and forth before then,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.660]   and literally true story, this is what happens next.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.780]   All the while, I'm thinking like,
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.940]   where could this possibly be going?
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.460]   You just wanted a bio late at night?
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.380]   What is going on?
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.660]   And next thing that happens, he goes, oh, huh, that's great.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.020]   Hey, somebody just walked in the house.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.620]   Can I call you back in 30 minutes?
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.860]   (laughing)
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.900]   Oh man, I can't believe this happened, I love it.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.980]   And I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to sleep now.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.500]   I have no idea where this is going.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.540]   Literally what's going through my head
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.740]   is where could he possibly be going?
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.660]   Why does he want, what are we even talking about?
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.940]   Did he like see some father wound today
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.540]   on that bow and arrow court that he's like,
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.300]   hey, we just need to talk about this right now.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.100]   Or did he, I don't know if he like wants to adopt me.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.900]   I don't know what is going on,
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.660]   and what he could possibly be asking me these questions for.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.660]   And so eventually, you know, we end up talking later,
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.660]   and he basically says, hey, I wanted you to teach
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.060]   this Sunday, and it was related to Mother's Day
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.580]   and part of my story growing up.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.060]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, why didn't you just lead with that?
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.260]   Because I'm like, where could we possibly be going
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.380]   with this at this moment in time?
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.060]   And the reason I start there is because,
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.180]   let me say this, what happened there,
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.620]   I think parallels this, or tells me something
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.540]   about the relationship that I have with Todd.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.100]   Although I was trying to connect the dots,
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.780]   which I don't know if you've ever been there before.
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.380]   I feel like we're constantly there trying
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.300]   to connect the dots on like at work or with a relationship,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.260]   or when someone says something,
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.220]   where are you going with this?
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.900]   In that moment, I'm trying to connect the dots with Todd.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.700]   Where could he possibly be going with this?
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.540]   But all the scenarios that I thought of
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.620]   of where he could be going,
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.900]   none of them were like off the deep end, horrible.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.660]   I knew he wasn't calling me to say,
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.460]   hey, just wanted to let you know I hate you.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.660]   Or hey, you're fired from your job,
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.260]   or we're sending you to Mongolia.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.380]   And congratulations.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.940]   I knew, just based on our relationship, I love it.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.900]   Just based on our relationship,
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.340]   courtesy laugh, my man, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.120]   Just based on our relationship of trust,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.620]   that wherever he was going,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.220]   it wasn't going to be somewhere like that.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.100]   I still wondered, where are we going with this?
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100]   But because of just the trust I know Todd,
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.220]   have a relationship with him,
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.060]   I knew that it wasn't going somewhere bad.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.580]   And really, any relationship that's marked by trust,
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.020]   all relationships at the heart of a healthy relationship
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.060]   is required trust.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.820]   Like for any relationship in your life or my life,
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.860]   I cannot have a healthy relationship
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.460]   without this idea of trust.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.940]   That thing that fills in the gap when you're like,
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.980]   I don't know where this is going, but I trust this person.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.300]   Some of you guys have had relational issues in the past.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.420]   You even call them.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.720]   You're like, hey, I haven't had healthy relationships
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.980]   because I'm a person who has relationship problems,
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.420]   and you call them trust problems.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.860]   Trust is at the epicenter of every healthy relationship.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.420]   And the reason I start there is because
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.760]   when it comes to the pages of scripture,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.620]   really the Bible teaches that God has invited all of us
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.820]   through Jesus into a relationship with him.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.380]   And a relationship that at the heart of it
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.400]   is to be marked by trust, a trust in God.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.000]   That if we're to have a healthy relationship,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.860]   trust is at the epicenter of this.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.820]   And so tonight, as it relates to this relationship
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.180]   that God's called us into, a relationship that,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.480]   although at times, just like with Todd, with God,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.860]   we won't always know, hey, where is this going, God?
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.000]   Where are you taking this?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.420]   Where, my circumstances, my job,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.180]   what are you doing with this relationship
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.900]   that I was, my dating world,
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.220]   I thought it was going in one direction
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.780]   and it totally changed.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.980]   What are you up to, God?
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.140]   Where are you going with this?
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.380]   In the same way, when we ask that question,
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.680]   we are to then experience this level of trust
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.700]   that defines our really existence.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.100]   We can go, hey, I don't know where this is going,
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.380]   but I trust you, Lord.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.580]   And so tonight, we're gonna discover from a man
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.580]   who was called the father of trust, or the father of faith.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.780]   Other places call him the man of faith,
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.620]   the man of trust, a guy who like,
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.200]   if anybody got this thing right,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.300]   he got an A in how to trust God.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.260]   A man by the name of Abraham.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.900]   That's right, there you go, come on.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.540]   Father Abraham had many sons.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.860]   I'm one of them and,
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.500]   boom, man, this crowd does not go to vacation Bible school
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.100]   when they were kids, that is unbelievable.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.220]   What is wrong with you people?
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.100]   We're gonna look at Abraham.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.060]   If you don't know who Abraham is,
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.900]   Abraham is one of the most influential figures in history.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.300]   The three biggest religions, Christianity, Judaism,
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.780]   and Islam all trace back to this one man.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.540]   Abraham is at the center of really the Christian faith
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.700]   and one of the most important people.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.580]   And he was a man who models for us.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.500]   We're gonna look at his story, look at his story,
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.660]   and discover how we can, in the midst of wondering,
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.500]   where are you going with this, God?
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.140]   I can trust you and learn from his example
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.540]   and learn from some of his mistakes.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.240]   So we're gonna trace through his story.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.260]   This will be in Genesis 12 through 22.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.580]   Yeah, buckle up.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.060]   12 through 22, we're not gonna look at all of it.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.780]   I'm gonna fly through some of his story
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.220]   and we're gonna look at three parts of Abraham,
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.140]   this man of trust story.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.940]   So we'll start in chapter 12.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.460]   All the verses will be on the screen.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.340]   And we'll kind of walk through each section by section
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.460]   and look what we can learn from this man
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.700]   who modeled what it looks like to have faith,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.980]   have trust, and how we can get there.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.620]   So we'll start in Genesis 12, verse one.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.420]   And I'll read the first four verses.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.380]   We'll talk about it for a little bit.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.820]   Where is God taking us?
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.920]   Here we go, so verse one of chapter 12.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.820]   The Lord said to Abram,
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.520]   this was before he has a name change,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.740]   which will make sense in a couple chapters.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.100]   He doesn't have the H and the A yet,
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.940]   but Abram will become Abraham.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.340]   The Lord said to Abram, "Go from your country,
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.060]   "from your people, your father's house,
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.520]   "to the land I will show you.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.280]   "I will make you a great nation.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.640]   "I will bless you.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.500]   "I will make your name great and you will be a blessing.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.340]   "I will bless those who bless you
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.460]   "and curse whoever curses you.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.920]   "And all peoples of earth will be blessed through you."
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.760]   So Abraham went.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.160]   As the Lord had told him, and Lot, his nephew,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.980]   went with him.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.020]   Abraham was 75 years old when he set off from Haran.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.960]   So here's what just happened.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.420]   God shows up to Abe.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.720]   Abraham hanging on the scene.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.160]   He's 75, like he wants to be playing golf in Malibu,
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.080]   retired.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.640]   God shows up and says, "Hey, I have different plans for you.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.640]   "I want you to go, Abraham.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.180]   "I'm gonna do something with you through your family,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.660]   "through your descendants, and through your line.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.000]   "And I'm gonna do something that'll bless the whole world.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.360]   "But the first thing I need you to do is I need you to go.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.680]   "Go where, God?"
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.220]   God literally says, "Hey, just go
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.340]   "and I will tell you when you will be there.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.240]   "I'll tell you when to stop.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.380]   "Should I stop in Canaan?
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.220]   "I'll tell you.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.000]   "I just want you to go and trust me with the destinations."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.360]   Our first idea, really, from the story of Abraham's life
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.560]   is this idea of what it looks like to trust God
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.700]   means trusting him with the destinations in our life.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.100]   Trusting him with where he's leading.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.780]   For us, for Abraham, that just meant
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.180]   his next stopping ground for all of us
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.460]   were in this series of destinations through life.
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.200]   Destination of who you're gonna marry,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.240]   where you're gonna work, where you're gonna live,
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.240]   who you are gonna exist in a relationship,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.220]   where you're gonna go to church,
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.840]   what job you're gonna work at,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.020]   the amount that you're gonna make.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.920]   All these different, the length of days that you will have,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.500]   God says, "I want you to trust me with the destinations.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.680]   "I just want you to focus on going.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.220]   "I want you to walk in total dependence on me, Abraham.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.180]   "And he may not send you from Dallas,
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.860]   "but he has invited you to live in this moment-by-moment
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.900]   "trust relationship with God.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.120]   "That I want you to trust me
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.960]   "with the destinations of your life."
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.160]   And God shows up to Abraham,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.120]   and Abraham, the first thing he shows us is,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.160]   "Hey, I'm gonna trust you, Lord, wherever you take me."
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.380]   Which, honestly, is so hard for me
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.220]   because there's part of me,
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.480]   and I think it's really all of us,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.240]   but maybe I'll just talk about me
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.640]   so that I'm not sharing the guilt.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.200]   It's all of us, though, right?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.480]   That I just wanna know more of the plan.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.980]   Like, God, hey, I just want you to tell me,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.820]   just fill in the gaps.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.280]   Like, I wish from a very early age,
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.700]   everything that we played as little kids,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.480]   whether it's "MASH" with the little paper thing
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.320]   you fold out and like,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.200]   "Oh, you're gonna live in an apartment, Mary D. Sally."
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.280]   Or you're gonna play with the magic eight ball,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.000]   and you're like, "Lord, am I supposed to work here?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   "No, maybe, okay, it's broken."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.840]   I wanna know what the plan are.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.880]   God, will you just tell me, we fill in the gaps.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.640]   I don't wanna trust you with the destination.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.160]   Will you just tell me my future?
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.880]   And I think Abraham models really something
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.840]   that's true for all of us,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.620]   that God is less concerned about you and I
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.560]   knowing the future,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.360]   and more concerned with us knowing him.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.040]   Like, I wanna know, specifically,
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.160]   even today I was joking with our team,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.560]   like, I often wanna know, like,
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.120]   how many years am I gonna live?
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.580]   What, 31 years, 35, 51, 75?
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.060]   'Cause that may impact how I plan things out down here, Lord.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.000]   And I think God just says,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.560]   "I want you to trust me."
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.800]   Day by day, moment by moment, dependence.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.160]   He's inviting all of us into this relationship
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.200]   where day by day, I'm gonna trust you, Lord.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.640]   Whatever you call me to today,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.040]   I'm gonna be faithful in that.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.480]   Am I supposed to work at this job?
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.660]   I don't know.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.880]   I do know how I'm supposed to work at this job.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   Hard, faithfully, to be the best employee here.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.080]   Am I supposed to marry Sally?
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.700]   Not me, 'cause I'm already married to Callie.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.160]   But you, whoever it is.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.200]   That one's pretty clear.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.120]   The Lord has spoken.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.140]   Am I supposed to marry this person?
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.440]   Maybe.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.260]   I know how you're supposed to pursue them,
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.560]   how you're supposed to go about dating them
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.440]   if they are to be there.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   And God's more concerned with this moment by moment,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.760]   daily trust, will you trust me?
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.040]   And he invites Abraham into this,
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.240]   and Abraham walks obediently with it.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.880]   That's not all that happens.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   Here's what happens next.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.680]   That just so reflects us and the trust issue.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.480]   This happens in verse one of chapter 15.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.080]   After this, so Abraham goes,
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.640]   God eventually says, "Stop right here."
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.880]   And then the Lord shows up later in his life,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.420]   and this is what happens.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.680]   After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.300]   And he said, "Do not be afraid, Abram.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.640]   "I am your shield, your very great reward."
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.580]   Lord shows up and says, "Hey, I'm your shield.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.480]   "I'm gonna protect you, Abram.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.980]   "I am your reward.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.020]   "You get me.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.260]   "I just want you to know you're getting God.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.340]   "You're getting the greatest thing
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.940]   "that could ever be given to you.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.900]   "That's your reward at the end of the day."
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.380]   And I love his response because it's so us.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.620]   Like God says, "Hey, you're gonna get me.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.960]   "You're gonna get the best thing you could ever get, God."
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.380]   And here's what Abraham says.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.860]   This is so us.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.820]   But Abraham said, "What can you give me
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.740]   "since I remain childless, Lord?
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.300]   "And who will inherit my estate
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.540]   "besides Eleazar of Damascus?"
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.340]   Abraham said, "You've given me no children,
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.860]   "so a servant in my household will be my heir."
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.340]   That Abraham does what we do when we're told, like God,
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.820]   "Hey, you get to spend eternity with God
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.040]   "forever and ever and ever.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.880]   "You're gonna be fully and finally satisfied.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.340]   "This life is a vapor.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.740]   "God, you get the greatest thing
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.660]   "that will ever be experienced for all of eternity."
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.800]   And we're like, "God, hey, I'm still single, God.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.420]   "Could you please show up and do something down here?
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.060]   "That's gonna be really great up there.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.460]   "I'm married to you forever,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.660]   "but I'd still like to have some kids down here."
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.460]   I mean, it's like totally us.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.580]   We just lose perspective.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.740]   That's what Abraham does.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.800]   And God responds despite that.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.300]   And says this, "Then the word of the Lord came to him.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.940]   "And he said, 'This man, Eleazar," poor Eleazar,
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.320]   "'This man, Eleazar, will not be your heir,'" verse four,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.540]   "but a son who is your own flesh and blood
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.620]   "will be your heir.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.620]   "Then God took him outside," 75-year-old Abraham, no kids.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.000]   God says, "You're gonna have a kid.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.980]   "Not only that, his kids and his kids
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.420]   "are gonna be more numerous than even the stars,"
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.240]   he says next.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080]   He took him outside and says,
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.760]   "Look up at the sky and count the stars,
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.460]   "if indeed you can count them."
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.680]   Then he said to him, "So show your offspring."
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.180]   Where he takes him outside.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.420]   And like if you have ever been camping
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.900]   in either West Texas, Colorado, wherever you go camping,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.680]   not in Dallas when you look at the stars.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.220]   Dallas, you see like three.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.400]   And you're like, "Oh, that's a plane."
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.940]   Oh, that's two.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.060]   And this, Abraham, from horizon to horizon,
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.820]   sees stars as far as the eye can see.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.480]   And God says, "Try to count them.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.340]   "This will be the number of descendants
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.260]   "that come from you, Abraham,
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.340]   "even though you have no child right now.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.160]   "This is the future that I have for you.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.980]   "Trust me with the destinations on the journey."
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.860]   And then a verse that really, this verse next,
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.640]   what Abraham does next is the foundation of Christianity.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.860]   It's the foundation of faith.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.960]   It's the foundation of a relationship with God,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.380]   if you'll ever have one.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.180]   Here's what Abraham does.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.380]   Abraham believed the Lord, and it was credited,
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.460]   or counted, or declared to him as righteousness.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.460]   What did that just mean?
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.160]   Abraham looked at the sky, and he said,
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.820]   "I believe you, Lord.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.680]   "If you say this will be, I trust you.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.100]   "I trust your promise."
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.060]   And in that moment of faith, all of a sudden,
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.900]   Abraham was given perfect righteousness with God.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.040]   Not because of what he had done, or how he had acted,
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.060]   or did he behave, but because he believed.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.180]   This is what Christianity is all about.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.020]   If you're here, back in church for the first time
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.940]   in a long time, or maybe the first time ever,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.260]   and you've ever wondered, what is the Bible about?
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.660]   What is Christianity about?
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.780]   The whole message of the Bible could be summed up
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.780]   in two words, God's invitation to man, saying, "Trust me.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.800]   "I want you to trust me."
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.460]   That all of Christianity is about,
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.900]   not can you believe, or can you behave,
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.420]   but who do you believe in?
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.960]   Who have you put your trust in?
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.780]   The message of world religions is, can you behave?
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.700]   Have you behaved?
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.260]   That's what every other major world religion,
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.300]   I really wanna make sure we get this before we move on,
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.500]   every other major world religion teaches
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.420]   that the issue is, when it comes to God
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.740]   and man's relationship together, can you behave?
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.300]   Can you do enough good things?
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.980]   That's what all of them teach.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.700]   And the message of Christianity is not, can you behave?
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.400]   It is, do you believe?
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.540]   Who have you trusted in?
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.860]   And Abraham believed, and in a moment,
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.860]   not based on how he behaved, but in who he believed.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.940]   Everything changed.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.580]   The father of our faith, he was declared righteous.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.280]   You, in a moment of faith tonight,
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.380]   if you put your faith not in how good of a person you are,
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.220]   and I'm sure you're a nice person,
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.220]   but in Jesus's work on the cross to pay for your sin,
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.100]   because the reality is,
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.380]   you're not as nice as you think you are.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.700]   You're not as good as you think you are, and neither am I.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.240]   That's why we need a savior.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.320]   And in a moment of belief, everything changed for Abraham.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.500]   This verse, three times in the New Testament,
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.980]   the New Testament authors say,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.800]   it's always been about, can you believe?
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.980]   It's never been about, can you behave?
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.900]   And Abraham believed, and perfect righteousness was his.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.500]   So Abraham models this faith for us,
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.260]   but really, sadly for him,
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.460]   and really encouraging in a weird way for us,
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.780]   or giving us hope, he's just like many of us in the room,
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.360]   that at times, we express this incredible faith,
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.120]   but we have these waves of just, over time,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.340]   as we look at our circumstances, and we're going,
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.660]   God, when are you gonna show up?
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.740]   And he has these moments of lapses in his life,
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.100]   and I'm gonna tell you about a couple of 'em
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.540]   where Abraham doesn't perfectly express faith,
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.420]   that although he said, God,
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.180]   I'm gonna trust you with the destinations,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.700]   he found himself saying,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.120]   I don't know if I can trust you in this situation.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.020]   If you're in the room tonight,
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.940]   and you have something in your life,
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.820]   where you're like, I don't know if I trust
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.140]   what God is up to here,
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.780]   with what's going on in my work,
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.940]   with where, I don't even wanna live in this city, Dallas.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.140]   I don't wanna be single.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.860]   I don't wanna be, all my other friends have gotten married,
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.980]   they're having kids, everything's moving on.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.320]   I don't like what the situation is in front of me.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.140]   Abraham found himself in very similar circumstances.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.220]   And sadly, he didn't walk by the faith
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.420]   that marked his original relationship,
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.260]   and beginning relationship with God.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.900]   And so, we're gonna talk about some of those,
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.820]   about what it looks like to trust him in your situation.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.280]   Our second idea, this comes from Genesis 16.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.920]   I'm gonna summarize the story,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.540]   so that we can keep moving through.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.700]   But basically, what happens,
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.960]   Abraham continues to wait for a child.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.940]   God says, hey, I'm gonna bring you a little baby boy.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.520]   That's what's coming for you, Abe.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.220]   You and your girl, Sarah, you're about to have a kid.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.400]   Just get excited, make up the nursery.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.260]   And Abraham's waiting and waiting and waiting.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.900]   10 years go by, there's no kid.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.980]   He looks over at his wife, Sarah, who's 75,
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.940]   and he's going, gosh, this woman is not having a baby.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.180]   She is not the baby mama.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.640]   This cannot work out.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.060]   The biological clock is not ticking anymore.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.420]   The clock fell off the wall,
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.540]   and Sarah's not having this baby.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.380]   And Sarah's going, I'm not having that baby.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.740]   I mean, think about it, 75.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.020]   Who do you know who's 75?
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.860]   And if you're like, yeah,
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.860]   but biblical ages are different, aren't they?
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.660]   The Bible says about Abraham and Sarah,
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.100]   they were as good as dead, how old they were.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.480]   That's how it describes it.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.460]   So Abraham's looking, Sarah's going,
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.660]   it's not coming for me.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.780]   And they look, and one day, they see this servant
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.180]   that was a part of their household named Hagar.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.840]   And they say, hey, why don't you go sleep with Hagar
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.720]   and Abraham, and maybe she can bring the child.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.960]   Maybe that's what God wants to do,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.040]   that Abraham begins to take things into his own hands.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.760]   And he takes things into his own hands,
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.680]   and they go sleep with Hagar, and what do you know?
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.360]   God brings into the world a little baby boy,
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.600]   but God shows up and says,
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.680]   this is not the child of the promise.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.880]   This child, I will bless,
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.380]   and he will have nations come from him,
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.820]   but this will not be the child
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.720]   that I choose to bless the whole world through.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.280]   His name was Ishmael.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.760]   Ishmael, if you know the story of Ishmael,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.120]   there was all kinds of conflict
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.220]   because Abraham said,
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.620]   I'm gonna just take things into my own hands.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.680]   I don't know if God's way is really gonna work out,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.480]   so I'm just gonna kind of make things work.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.580]   Because of that decision,
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.600]   all kinds of chaos was brought into Abraham's family.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.560]   Conflict began to mark their family.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.040]   There was a feud, and eventually,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.560]   Ishmael and his mom were separated
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.900]   from the rest of the family,
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.080]   and to this day, a conflict exists
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.720]   between the two sons of Abraham.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.040]   Because Ishmael, and Ishmael,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.960]   and if you know the story of the Arab nations,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.200]   they trace their line to Ishmael.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.280]   Is there a conflict today
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.160]   between the Arab nations and the Jews?
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.000]   Yes.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.560]   This will be on CNN.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.960]   Click it on, you'll see something about the Middle East.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.240]   That's what we call that.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.960]   That's what the conflict between the Arab nation
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.900]   and the Jew, all of which started here,
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.340]   and his desire to take things into his own hands.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.260]   He brought consequences, not just for him and his family,
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.100]   consequences we still see the effects of today.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.900]   This is the person who brings things into their own hands
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.100]   'cause they don't trust God,
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.020]   and they bring chaos into the world as well.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.620]   Like, this is the person, truly,
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.780]   this is the girl who says, like,
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.480]   look, I know, I'm dating this guy,
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.900]   and he's really not a believer,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.220]   but I'm working with him, we're gonna get there.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.580]   I feel like I'm a light in his world.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.120]   I feel like I'm a good example for him.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.200]   I've seen Fixer Upper.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.280]   I know how this thing works.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.300]   He's my little Fixer Upper.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   We're gonna make it work.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.780]   And this is the person who ends up
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.220]   pursuing that relationship, thinking like,
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.920]   hey, I need to be the vessel which God uses to save him.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.780]   Ends up going farther in that relationship,
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.280]   sometimes even gets married,
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.200]   and brings all kinds of pain into their life,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.280]   the pain that comes from marrying someone
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.680]   who doesn't share the same faith as you.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.720]   This is the person who says, like,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.540]   look, I'm gonna take things into my own hands.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.880]   I'm in an unhappy marriage.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   I'm getting a divorce.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.800]   I mean, God wants me to be happy, right?
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   That's what God wants for us.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.460]   And they say, I'm just gonna get a divorce,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.540]   and all kinds of pain is brought into their life.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.640]   The person, tragically, who takes
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.440]   and taking things into their own hands,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.800]   rather than trusting God with whatever situation
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   is in front of them, ends up taking the life of a child.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.760]   Ends up saying, hey, I'm going to abort this child
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.080]   because, man, God would not want this child
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.400]   to be raised in a home like this.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.320]   Could be crazy.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.600]   And if you're in the room, and that's part of your story,
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.780]   any of those things, man, there is so much grace.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.720]   God can redeem, restore any story, any story.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.380]   One of my closest friends, partners in ministry,
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.160]   is a girl named Allie, who that's a part of her story.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.600]   And she is a testimony to just how God can redeem
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.420]   and work no matter how bleak.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.960]   But at the same time, she would acknowledge
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.280]   there's incredible pain.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.720]   When we grab and take things into our own hands,
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.040]   and take them out of God's.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.840]   And so Abraham modeled this,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.520]   and not only did he have a lapse of faith there,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.760]   there's another time where God shows up,
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.720]   and basically, shortly after this, he says,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.600]   look, I'm going to give you a child.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.720]   And Abraham's response, he literally laughs
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.640]   in the face of God.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.920]   I'm gonna read it, and it's almost comical.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.880]   This is what happens a little bit later.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.080]   God shows up, and he says, hey, Abraham,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.640]   I know you still don't have a child,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.680]   and it's been 25 years.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.120]   Think about that.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.400]   God promises you something,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.440]   you're expecting something from him, 25 years.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.880]   If we don't get a prayer request that we pray on Thursday,
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.000]   answered by like Sunday, we're like,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.760]   where are you, God, where are you?
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.520]   Abraham, 25 years.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.120]   He's still waiting, and God shows up,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.840]   and gosh, I love this part, because it's so like crazy.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.360]   He says this, verse five of chapter 17, next chapter.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   No longer, Abraham, God shows up,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.280]   hey, does he show up with a little child?
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.360]   No, I'm showing up with a name change.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.680]   I want you to change your name.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.080]   What am I gonna go by, God?
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.160]   You will be called Abraham,
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.480]   for I have made you the father of many nations.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.000]   I will make you very fruitful.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.040]   I will make nations and kings come from you.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.720]   Wait a second, God, I don't even have one king,
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.000]   or one child, let alone a nation.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.080]   Can I just get one?
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.960]   Not only do I want you to change your name,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.280]   we're gonna change Sarai's name, your wife.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.000]   She's gonna be the mother of many nations.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And as for Sarai, you are no longer to call her Sarai.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.560]   Her name will be Sarah.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.840]   I will bless her and give her a son by you.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.800]   I will bless her so she will be the mother of nations.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.000]   Like, imagine this conversation
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.520]   when he gets home to his wife.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.600]   So God showed up today, and apparently,
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.520]   I'm supposed to stop going by Abraham,
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.360]   and start going by father of many nations.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.040]   I'm Big Papa, and you are Big Mama from now on.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.840]   And think about it, I mean, he doesn't have a kid,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.160]   he's gotta go around the neighborhood
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.680]   when people are like, hey, Abe,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.520]   you mind if I borrow, you know, camel?
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.440]   I don't know what they borrow.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   Hey, Abe, you mind if I borrow?
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.240]   And he's like, actually, you call me father of many nations.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.480]   Okay, Abe, you don't even have a kid.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.400]   It's father of many nations, first off.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.360]   Like, think about this, for an entire year,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.320]   change your name to father of nations.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.600]   That is crazy.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.960]   And God, in the midst of this, says,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.120]   hey, I'm inviting you because I've said it.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.720]   You can take it to the bank.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.880]   It's as good as done.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.520]   You are a father of many nations
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.880]   because it's going to happen.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.920]   That's how sure of a thing that it is,
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.400]   and I want you to call yourself that.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.840]   Here's what Abraham does.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.720]   In the midst of being told this would happen,
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.640]   he doesn't do what I think a lot of us look at the Bible
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.080]   and we're like, man, what a faithful patriarch
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.940]   who must have said, yes, Lord, you have spoken,
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.780]   and so it shall be.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.840]   Here's what he does.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.000]   Abraham fell on his face and laughed.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.800]   He laughed at God, saying,
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.560]   will a son be born to a man 100 years old?
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   Will Sarah bear a child at age 90?
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.600]   And Abraham said to God,
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.240]   if only Ishmael could have your blessing,
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   then God said, yes, but your wife, Sarah,
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.240]   will bear you a son.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.980]   You will call him Isaac.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.160]   I have made my covenant with him.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.720]   I will establish it with him
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.200]   as an everlasting covenant for his descendants.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.560]   Time goes by, and God, despite Abraham laughing in his face,
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.580]   despite the waves of not trusting him in his situation,
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:01.640]   despite his faithlessness, God is faithful to the promise,
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.180]   and a little baby boy shows up.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.020]   Sarah gets a bump in her stomach,
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.360]   and nine months later, Isaac gets brought into the world.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.080]   And I wanna pause really quickly here
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.540]   before we go to the last part of the story.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.420]   I think this was the pivot point in Abraham's life.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.240]   I think this was the moment when he began to go,
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.080]   oh my gosh, God, whatever you say is going to happen.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.000]   I trust you.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.680]   I think because we're told later on
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.920]   that Abraham's faith grew, that on the journey with God,
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.760]   he grew strong in his faith as he saw God continue to work.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.880]   And I think, and why do I think that?
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.140]   Mainly because what would you do if you were Abraham
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.880]   and you saw a 90-year-old woman give birth to a baby?
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.680]   For us, we're like, oh man, that's crazy.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.260]   That's so biblical crazy.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.220]   Think about your grandma.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.360]   My grandma's 93.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.920]   Girl ain't having no babies anytime soon.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.400]   You got any grandmas around?
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.760]   No children coming through that.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.080]   Abraham watches.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.640]   I apologize.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.600]   And by that, I mean a woman, her.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.880]   We're gonna just move on.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.240]   (laughing)
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.520]   We're just closing prayer after that, Lord.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.760]   It's true.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.680]   It's true.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.120]   Oh man, okay.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.760]   Oh man.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   So anyway, all right.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.400]   So Abraham sees this, but it did happen there.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   Abraham sees it happen in his own life.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.480]   He sees God show up.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.680]   He sees God deliver and keep his promise.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.960]   And let me bring us back.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.280]   I think it was in this moment that he began,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   his faith grew strong.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.960]   No matter what God says will happen,
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.120]   if he says it, it's true.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.420]   It's going to happen.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.320]   And I say that not only because of how amazing it would be
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.160]   if we saw it firsthand,
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.000]   but because of what happens next in Abraham's life.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.040]   And this man who both expressed faith at times
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.640]   and then had these moments and waves
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.960]   where he didn't trust God,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.480]   all of a sudden does what I think is unimaginable
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.300]   in terms of faith.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.440]   Shows an amount of faith,
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.460]   I don't even know how to get my arms around fully.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.180]   And God comes to him and says one more thing.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.180]   So the baby is here.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.020]   Isaac is here.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.320]   God's kept his promise.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.000]   Abraham's been waiting 25 years.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.760]   Finally, a little baby boy is here.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.160]   Finally, a child that God has promised will live,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.480]   that God has promised Isaac will be the one
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.620]   that my covenant never ends through.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.160]   Isaac will be the one, this little baby boy,
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.680]   he's going to be the one who will bring about
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.300]   really the savior of the world.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.740]   Jesus would come through Isaac.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.400]   So Abraham's sleeping well knowing,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.040]   "Hey, I know God has promised."
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.560]   And just like he promised and it was fulfilled
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.720]   in a 90-year-old woman, this child will live.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.000]   This child will bring into the world the savior.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.880]   Until all of a sudden one day, God shows up to Abraham
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.240]   and he begins to test Abraham's faith.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.200]   His final exam, if you will, of faith
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.080]   in their relationship.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.240]   And here's what God invites all of us to.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.460]   He's about to show how he calls Abraham
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.800]   to a place I think he calls and wants all of us to live at.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.400]   But it's a place of trusting God,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.720]   this is our third point, with no reservation.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.760]   That he's gonna trust God.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   "I'm not holding anything back, God.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.680]   "I'm gonna trust you with anything and everything."
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.540]   And here's what happens next in Abraham's story.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.260]   So the little boy begins to grow
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.220]   and this is what happens.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.500]   Sometime later, this is chapter 22,
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.100]   God tested Abraham.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.860]   And he said, "Abraham," and Abraham said, "Here I am."
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.820]   And then God said, "Take your son,
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.700]   "your only son whom you love,"
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.080]   or your one and only son you may have, Isaac,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.240]   "and go to the region of Moriah, go to Mount Moriah,
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.300]   "and sacrifice him there as a burnt offering
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.640]   "on a mountain that I will show you."
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.680]   Child sacrifice?
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.900]   Like God, what is it?
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.840]   You want me to sacrifice the child?
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.340]   What are you asking me to do?
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.380]   I mean, I've been waiting years and years and years
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.540]   for this child and finally he's here
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.820]   and you're saying, "Go and I want you to sacrifice him."
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.420]   What are you asking me to do?
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.680]   But Abraham, I think this is why I believe
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.060]   that his faith had grown strong,
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.940]   that he knew no matter what God's asking me to,
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.780]   I can trust him.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.900]   I know that he's a good, loving father.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.620]   He wouldn't call me to do something
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:26.340]   that went against his will, his good and perfect will,
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.700]   so I'm gonna trust him.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.460]   We're told later in the book of Hebrews
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.180]   that Abraham in this moment believed and trusted
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.260]   that even if he sacrificed his son,
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.860]   God could raise him from the dead.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.460]   He knew that this child must live
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.340]   and so even if God's asking me to kill this child
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.660]   and just wait for it,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.020]   'cause you can feel the tension of the story,
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.420]   even if God's asking me
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.300]   that he can even raise him from the dead,
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.820]   there's nothing impossible for him, so I'm gonna go
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.220]   and I don't know what he's gonna do,
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.700]   but I'm not holding back.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.520]   I'm gonna trust him without reservation.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.380]   Whatever he calls me to, I'm putting it in your hands, God.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.260]   And Abraham goes and he goes to Mount Moriah
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.660]   early the next morning and I just,
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.100]   the mixture of emotions he must have felt
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.540]   as he gets on a donkey with his son who he's going to kill.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.700]   Early the next morning, Abraham got up
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.540]   and loaded the donkey.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.380]   He took two of his servants and his son Isaac
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.020]   and when he had cut the wood for the burnt offering,
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.300]   they set out for the place God had told him about.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.180]   On the third day, Abraham looked up
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.780]   and saw the place in the distance.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.740]   Three days, three nights,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.860]   camping underneath the same stars that God said,
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.140]   this son, Isaac, will be the one
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.940]   through whom more than the stars you could count will come.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.620]   Where could God be going with this?
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.100]   And he said to the servants when they arrived at the mountain
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.400]   stay here with the donkey.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.260]   So God says, I want you to go to this mountain
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.660]   and build an altar, sacrifice him here.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.260]   At the bottom of the mountain, Abraham says,
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.140]   hey, servants, you guys stay here.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.460]   I love what he says next.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.860]   While I and the boy go over there,
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.860]   we will worship and then we will come back to you.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.440]   I don't know what's about to happen.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.180]   I don't know what's gonna happen up on that altar,
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.020]   but I know this, at the end of the day, I can trust God.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.900]   I know even if he has to raise my son from the dead,
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.940]   we will come back to you.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.500]   This is the child of the promise
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.380]   and I can't fully understand how God could be asking me
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.020]   to do this right now, but I know I can trust him.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.820]   I'm gonna continue to walk with him.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.160]   Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.580]   He placed it on his son, Isaac.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.580]   He carried the fire, the torch, and the knife.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.700]   As the two of them went on together, Isaac said,
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.020]   father, yes, my son, the fire and the wood are here,
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.940]   but where's the lamb for the burnt offering?
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.660]   Abraham answered, I love this.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.340]   God himself will provide the lamb
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.900]   for the burnt offering, my son.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.500]   And the two of them went on together.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.240]   When they reached the place that God had told them about,
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.780]   Abraham built the altar there.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.700]   He arranged the wood on it.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.060]   He bound his son, Isaac, and he laid him on the altar
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.780]   on top of the wood, and there he reached his hand
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.420]   and took the knife to slay his son.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.700]   But the angel of the Lord called out from heaven,
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.500]   Abraham, Abraham, here I am, he replied.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.000]   Do not lay a hand on the boy.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.360]   Do not do anything to him.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.760]   Now I know that you fear God.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.980]   You have not withheld your only son from me.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.440]   Abraham looked up, and there in the thicket,
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.060]   Abraham's sitting there, he was about to sacrifice his son,
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.900]   and God says, don't touch the child.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.460]   I'll provide a sacrifice.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.860]   And he looks up, and he doesn't see a lamb.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.660]   He sees a ram caught in the thicket inside of the wood.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.300]   Miraculously, all of a sudden, an animal has appeared
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.980]   right before them to be the sacrifice God provided.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.220]   He went over and he took the ram
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.680]   and he sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.820]   So God called that place, or Abraham called that place,
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.020]   the Lord will provide.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.180]   To this day, it is said, on the mountain of the Lord,
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.180]   it will be provided.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:07.020]   That Abraham, despite waiting years and years,
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.420]   said, I'm going to trust you.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.780]   I'm going to even place the life of my son.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.580]   And this is what I mean by, I don't know
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.660]   that I have enough faith to do what Abraham did.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.560]   I think there's things in my life I know that there are,
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.260]   my son included, where I would go,
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.900]   God, I cannot give you this.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.940]   I mean, there's parts of my own life,
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.640]   when I think about like job and future,
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.380]   and even like ministry, and Annie's here,
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.300]   and music, make it spiritual.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.140]   And I think of just like, what are you doing, God?
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.260]   Where I'm going, I don't know if I'll let you touch this.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.380]   I don't want you to touch my wife's health.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.180]   And Abraham models for us where he just says,
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.700]   look, I'm not holding anything back, God.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.740]   I'm putting all of it in your hands.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.140]   I trust you.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.380]   I trust you with whatever you do, God.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.380]   And I think the crazy thing for me on the things
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.660]   that all of us, and I know you're in the room,
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.100]   they're holding onto things tight.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.640]   When it comes down to like your singleness,
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.000]   you gotta, hey, take anything.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.400]   I'm not gonna be single for the rest of my life.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.240]   I will do whatever,
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.600]   I will get on 19 different eHarmony accounts.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.160]   I am not being single, God.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.600]   Do not take that from me.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.680]   And I think all of us have this reluctance to God,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.220]   I'm not giving you this.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.280]   And I think the crazy thing is like,
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.840]   Abraham said, hey, I'm gonna put even my son's life
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.360]   in your hands, as if it's not there already.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.040]   You're the only thing keeping him alive.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.820]   You're the only thing that holds any chance
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.940]   for whatever future you have in this room.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.700]   There's nothing that you're holding onto
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.860]   that God's not already holding onto.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.300]   It's not already in his hands.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.180]   And the best shot we have is to place it
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.140]   and surrender to him.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.740]   I love the story of Isaac,
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.840]   and I'll close here, we'll land the plane.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.020]   Because Abraham, not only did he get to see God show up
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.800]   in miraculous ways, he got to see something else.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.660]   He got to see what the story of Isaac
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.460]   and really Abraham is all about.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.820]   And so if you've been tuning out,
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.700]   tune back in right here.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.860]   If you're counting these little wood things,
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.980]   come everybody right back here.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.540]   We're gonna just look at the very purpose
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.260]   of the entire story of Abraham and Isaac.
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.020]   It was never just about the sacrifice of this son.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.620]   It was about the sacrifice of a son
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.440]   that would come years and years later.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.300]   I mean, see the parallels in the story.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.300]   Take your son, your one and only son who you love.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.600]   And all of us in that moment are going,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.780]   God, what the heck?
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.980]   How can you ask him to kill his son?
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.640]   I'm not gonna have him kill his son
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.900]   because I'm killing mine.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.880]   On behalf of him and Isaac and all of the human race.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.160]   He's the one that will be delivered up.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.100]   I mean, see the parallels on the same mountain,
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.060]   Mount Moriah.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.620]   You know what we call Mount Moriah today?
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.200]   Mount Calvary.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.220]   It's the exact same dirt.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.180]   I'm not saying like, oh yeah,
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.600]   it's kind of like the same picture.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.980]   Literally the same place.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.940]   2000 years before Jesus, God on that mountain says,
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.080]   don't kill the son.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.260]   I'm gonna kill mine.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.520]   The whole story, Isaac carrying the wood
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.820]   up that mountain years later,
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.120]   Jesus would carry not wood for an altar,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.980]   but wooden cross on his back.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.020]   Because the story points to the God
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.320]   who steps into the world.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.240]   And we ask, where are you going with this?
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.360]   Jesus, that's where the whole thing's been going to.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.800]   That's really what the whole Old Testament,
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.600]   BC before Christ, it all points to Christ.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.140]   Everything, last week we talked about Noah,
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.420]   the week before Adam and Eve,
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.300]   all of them, they're pictures of Jesus.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.560]   Jesus said this in Luke 24,
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.880]   where he basically says, look,
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.200]   everything in the Old Testament,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.960]   first half, all about me.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.620]   This is the sequel to all of them.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.560]   Jesus, they all point to him.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.180]   Adam, who failed his test in the garden,
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.200]   Jesus passed his in the garden.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.640]   Noah, a piece of wood lifted up and raised,
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.360]   much like a wooden cross raised,
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.640]   and all who trust in it will be saved.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.480]   Isaac, the son who was spared, the one and only son.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.800]   It's all been pointing to Jesus.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.160]   Your life, everything that you're going through,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.440]   everything in your life,
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.520]   God right now is trying to use to point you to Jesus,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.720]   to allow you to look at Jesus.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.640]   Abraham, Jesus says about Abraham,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.040]   and I love this part, and I promise you,
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.360]   I'm laying in the plane, we are landing this plane.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.520]   Abraham, Jesus said, Abraham saw my day coming.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.560]   He looked forward to my day coming.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.320]   John 8, 56, Jesus says, he's talking to these Jews,
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.960]   he says, you're sons of Abraham, right?
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.160]   Abraham looked forward to my day coming.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   And then it says this, and he saw it, and he was glad.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.960]   Not just, hey, he was looking forward,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.480]   he was excited this would one day come,
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.680]   you know, he didn't exactly understand.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.520]   Abraham, distinct from the others, Abraham saw it coming.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.320]   Not only when he looked up from the thicket and saw the ram,
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.120]   he saw the Lamb of God coming.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.480]   He saw what this was all about.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.300]   He saw what all of life is about,
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.200]   that all of meaning on this planet,
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.760]   you cannot experience meaning without knowing Jesus.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.360]   Life finds its meaning in Jesus.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.640]   Everything you're going through,
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.360]   everything you being here tonight,
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.480]   listen to me, please, you here tonight,
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.120]   if you do not know Jesus, are in this room
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.000]   because the God of the universe has woven your story
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.480]   to land you here right now,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.840]   trying to point you to the King of Kings,
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.720]   the Savior, who God said, spare Isaac and spare you.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.560]   I'm going to kill my son so that they can live.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.760]   That's what God is doing.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.400]   That's what everything in your life you're going through
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.380]   is meant to point you to look at Jesus.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.340]   If you are a believer,
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.240]   it's meant to make you look more like Jesus.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.360]   It's all about him.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.520]   It's always been about him and will always be about him.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.640]   And if you don't know him,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.020]   he sends the invitation to you, will you trust me?
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.320]   Not just in a moment by moment basis on the cross
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.340]   with arms spread out wide, trust in me,
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.840]   not in what you do.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.640]   That's the message of the gospel.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.080]   Trust in me.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.320]   Trust that I paid for your sin.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.720]   Trust that I'm enough.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.920]   You're not a good enough person to get in.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.040]   You never will be.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.600]   But I'm giving you a free ticket.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.020]   Will you trust me?
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:07.320]   The son who was slain, the lamb God provided,
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.800]   and everything is meant to look towards him
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   or make you, if you know him, look more like him.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.080]   I'm gonna pray that would be the case and we'll close.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.200]   Father, thank you for the story of Abraham and Isaac
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.520]   and the story of faith.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.120]   Just the example of a man who trusted you in the midst
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:30.600]   of just incredible asks, go.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.360]   I'll tell you when to stop.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.960]   Trust me with even your son.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.760]   Lord, thank you that despite just his failures,
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.160]   despite my failures, my moments,
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.920]   I just don't trust you.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.880]   Everyday moments, you still love us.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.560]   You're patient with us.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.620]   You still died for us.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.400]   You still allow us to have a relationship with you
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.560]   defined by faith.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.320]   That it's not about can you behave,
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.680]   but do you believe that Jesus paid for it?
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.800]   Father, we worship you now through song.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.080]   We thank you that all of life finds meaning
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.600]   in knowing Jesus and seeing Jesus.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.960]   Thank you for this scandal of grace we're about to sing
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.220]   where you died for us, you died in our place.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.640]   We sing and worship you through song now, amen.
