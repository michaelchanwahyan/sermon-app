1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,120
 Come on, Fortch, how we doing?

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,560
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,080
 Come on.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,720
 Come on, come on.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,120
 Tonight, yes, tonight we are talking,

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,760
 I'm talking to the men.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,360
 Hey ladies, you can leave.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,560
 No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,200
 Hey, are there any dudes here anyways?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,040
 Do you guys show up?

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,740
 (audience cheering)

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,640
 I love it, I love it, I love it.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,040
 Well, I wanna say hi to our campuses,

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,880
 El Paso and Fort Worth and Houston and Tulsa

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,320
 and wherever you're at around the world,

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,280
 if you're listening, welcome to the porch.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,580
 We're glad you're here.

19
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,120
 We're talking to the men, what to look for in a woman.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,020
 And so to find out what you guys are thinking,

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,020
 we went to the State Fair of Texas here in Dallas

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,560
 and we were asking some guys.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,000
 And so we caught some video.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,060
 Why don't we start just by watching this?

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,440
 Hey guys, Josh and Elaine out here at the State Fair

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,600
 and we're here trying to figure out how people navigate

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,740
 life, love, relationships.

28
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,840
 Dating, their dream guy, their dream girl,

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,780
 do you believe in the one, soulmate, all that stuff.

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,620
 Yeah, come along with the ride, let's figure it out.

31
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,480
 Describe to me your dream girl.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,620
 You know, she gotta like be into the same stuff

33
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,980
 that I can be into, 'cause like if we ain't into the same stuff

34
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,120
 we're not gonna click.

35
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,460
 Probably have to be like a Mexican, nice body, tan.

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,400
 She got a nice smile, some cute eyes.

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,060
 You know, the body doesn't have to be perfect,

38
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,000
 but you know, a little, a little curviness.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,100
 Funny I guess.

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,340
 Yeah, what do you think?

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,440
 Yeah, someone who's quirky like me, I don't know.

42
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,840
 Just instant connection I guess.

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,980
 Like he said, beautiful smile,

44
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,640
 that's like the first thing, smile.

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,020
 If she has a good personality,

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,620
 I never really was big on the body, so like.

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,860
 (laughing)

48
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:05,360
 All right, all right, all right.

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,440
 So that's what we're thinking.

50
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,000
 So my family and I, we went to the state fair as well,

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,540
 and a very different experience, right,

52
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,840
 when you got three kids with you,

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,380
 and so you know, we're riding the ladybugs and stuff.

54
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,140
 And we go through this like, that warehouse thing

55
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,880
 where they, it's not the car show,

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,220
 but that area by Big Tex, if you've been there,

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,680
 you've been to Dallas.

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,420
 And in there they like sell hot tubs and mattresses.

59
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,660
 You guys been in there?

60
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,960
 You probably don't even go in there,

61
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,620
 but we go in there 'cause we're those people.

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,660
 And we're walking through,

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,400
 and there's this guy selling a Vitamix, a blender.

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,600
 Like and so we, our family, we get sucked into this guy.

65
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,740
 He's got the microphone on, and he's just making the sale,

66
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,800
 talking about how amazing this blender is.

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,740
 And so I don't know if you have blenders

68
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,240
 where you're into like juicing celery or something,

69
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,620
 but this dude's just getting after it.

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,020
 And it's an amazing blender, right?

71
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,160
 Like it weighs the stuff that you put inside.

72
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,520
 It tells you the recipe, and then it tells you

73
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,420
 if you're putting enough of it in there.

74
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,860
 And he's mixing it all up, and he's pulling some spinach,

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,020
 and some kale, and some grapes.

76
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,060
 I'm like, man, I don't want anything to do with that.

77
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,000
 But as he adds, he adds some like ice and water,

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,240
 and it keeps telling you it will be green

79
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,440
 until you put just, or actually it's red, I'm sorry,

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
 it'll be red until you put just enough in,

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,880
 and then it turns green, and it says,

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,580
 okay, switch to the next ingredient.

83
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,880
 And he's just mixing it up.

84
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,040
 And as I was thinking about that with my family,

85
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,180
 as this guy's adding stuff in there,

86
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,820
 this is what I think guys do when it comes

87
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,220
 to trying to find the perfect woman.

88
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,460
 You know, they want these different ingredients, okay?

89
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,200
 Like I want her to be really fun, okay?

90
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,000
 But not too much drama, okay?

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,160
 I want her to love football, but not too much football,

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,940
 like not more than me, 'cause that's weird.

93
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,780
 And I want her to be like really hot, you know,

94
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,440
 add the cayenne or whatever.

95
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,180
 I want her, she needs to look like Gigi Hadid

96
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,620
 or Megan Fox, but also serve like Mother Teresa, okay?

97
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,480
 But, and so I want her to love to work out,

98
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,820
 because I like to look at people who love to work out,

99
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,400
 and so you're kind of throwing that stuff in there, right?

100
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,100
 This is what you're thinking,

101
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,500
 and you're trying to mix up the perfect woman.

102
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 And it leaves you looking, and wanting, and searching.

103
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,780
 Because if I'm honest, as I've met with guys

104
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,780
 over the past decade, here's what I,

105
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,620
 here's been my big takeaway

106
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,520
 of what you guys are looking for.

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
 You don't know what you're looking for.

108
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,420
 You don't really know what you're looking for.

109
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,220
 You're thinking, oh, you know, I'll just,

110
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,860
 when I find it, I'll have this feeling,

111
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,760
 this emotional response.

112
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,940
 That's what's going on, like it'll be perfect,

113
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,860
 it'll be just the right mix of everything,

114
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,660
 so I have a little bit of this, a little bit of that,

115
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,700
 and everything is gonna blend together perfectly,

116
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,900
 throw me into her life,

117
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,940
 and we're gonna mix together perfectly.

118
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,580
 And that's just not how it works.

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,780
 And what it does is I see guys get into relationships,

120
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,480
 and everything seems right,

121
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,080
 but then anxiety kicks in, fear kicks in,

122
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,640
 cold feet kicks in, all of these questions

123
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,020
 begin to consume them, they go,

124
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,860
 well, I don't know if she's the one,

125
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,240
 or if we're gonna make it work,

126
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,400
 or if I should take that, you know, go further,

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,440
 take that step.

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,800
 And what if?

129
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,040
 What if I could help you tonight?

130
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,140
 What if I could give you from the scriptures,

131
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,520
 the things to look for in a woman,

132
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,440
 just to keep it really simple,

133
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,920
 hey, here's some things that you can look for in a woman.

134
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,660
 So this evening, we're talking about the fantasy girl,

135
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,420
 as we move through this series called Fantasy,

136
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,880
 Finding Real Love in a Fake World.

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,140
 And the reason we say finding real love in a fake world

138
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,720
 is because that's the big felt need

139
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
 that everybody came in here with,

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,080
 everybody's listening with, you want to be loved,

141
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,420
 you want to experience love, you want to give love.

142
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,220
 But the problem is, is the world says,

143
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,760
 hey, this is how you do that,

144
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,920
 they have no idea what they're talking about.

145
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,760
 They're awful at it.

146
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,100
 They're really, really, really bad at it,

147
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,440
 and yet they're your teachers.

148
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,560
 Be it social media, be it Tinder, be it movies,

149
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,880
 be it TV shows, be it airbrushed magazines, it's fake.

150
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,900
 And it leaves you not knowing what you're looking for.

151
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,740
 And you end up thinking about a wife like she's a smoothie,

152
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,880
 with all the perfect ingredients in there.

153
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,880
 And you don't even know what ingredients you're looking for.

154
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,280
 I'll say it in a different way,

155
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,780
 kind of throwback to last week,

156
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,200
 you're looking for the wrong ingredients.

157
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,780
 And so what can we do about it?

158
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,780
 I want you to know I understand, like I empathize with you.

159
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,680
 When I was looking for a wife, I mean,

160
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,120
 here's the truth about where I was at,

161
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,480
 wasn't in a relationship with Jesus.

162
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,400
 I was entrenched into an addiction to pornography and sex.

163
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,620
 I loved going to the strip clubs.

164
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,540
 So what did I want in a wife?

165
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,380
 I wanted someone who looked like a porn star,

166
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,500
 who I could tolerate.

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,120
 Like, honestly, like I could just put up with her.

168
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,220
 And I think the reason I say that is,

169
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,900
 I think that's a lot of you,

170
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,460
 men, you came in here,

171
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,240
 you've been brainwashed by the same teacher I was.

172
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,380
 And you may not say it like I did,

173
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,380
 but subconsciously, that's what you want.

174
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,180
 You want someone who's hot by your standards

175
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,580
 and that you can tolerate.

176
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,580
 And that's gonna lead to tragedy, disaster,

177
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,400
 despair, divorce, and a lot of hurt.

178
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,580
 And it may just leave you,

179
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,960
 you might just keep looking and looking

180
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,420
 and looking and looking.

181
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,860
 I want you to know, men, marriage is a good thing.

182
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,940
 Proverbs 18, verse 22 says,

183
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,980
 "He who finds a wife finds what is good

184
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,660
 "and receives favor from the Lord."

185
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,060
 And so if you are here or you are listening

186
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,500
 and you are well and you want a wife, find one.

187
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,340
 Like, find one, I wanna help you.

188
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,780
 Like, we could do this before you go home tonight.

189
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,580
 Like, I'm telling you, we can make it super simple.

190
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,980
 All right, we'll just do some arranged marriages,

191
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,440
 mix it up, it's gonna be awesome.

192
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,100
 But you gotta start by knowing what you're looking for.

193
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,620
 And so I think the scripture's gonna do this.

194
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,100
 So we're talking about the fantasy girl

195
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,860
 and it's interesting because there's a scripture,

196
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,900
 an entire chapter of the Bible

197
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,540
 dedicated to the fantasy girl,

198
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,020
 or the gold standard, if you will.

199
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,820
 Do you know what it was, what it is?

200
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,420
 Proverbs 31, Proverbs 31, woman.

201
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,500
 I probably referenced Proverbs 31 50 times

202
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,640
 in the past 10 years, and I've never taught this text

203
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,180
 in the way that we're going to do it tonight,

204
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,100
 verse by verse, looking at it.

205
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,740
 And it's really an interesting text

206
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,220
 because you know who wrote it?

207
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,060
 So it says King Lemuel.

208
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,420
 King Lemuel, there's some debate around this,

209
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,500
 but leading scholarship believes

210
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,740
 that there was no King Lemuel of Israel.

211
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,900
 We don't see that in history.

212
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,580
 We should encourage you because the other kings

213
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,500
 we see in history, the history books,

214
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,380
 show us who they were.

215
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,660
 We don't see this one.

216
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,180
 King Lemuel means devoted to God or the fruit of my vows.

217
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,740
 So people think that it's Solomon, talking about Solomon,

218
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,660
 but it says really who wrote it

219
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,180
 is actually King Lemuel's mom, which would be Bathsheba.

220
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,180
 And so this scripture would have written by Bathsheba.

221
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,600
 And here's why, it's a loving mother, a wise mother,

222
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,660
 giving instruction to her kid of,

223
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,140
 hey, this is who I'm praying that you end up with.

224
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,900
 Proverbs 31, verse 10 through 31,

225
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,100
 is actually a poem, it's an acrostic.

226
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,780
 And so there's 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet.

227
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,540
 Every line starts with one of those letters.

228
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,980
 If it was written, if it was done in English,

229
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,220
 it would be like, you know, A is for apple, B is for,

230
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,780
 and so that's an acrostic.

231
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,980
 As you go down, it's the first letter

232
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,420
 of every letter of the Hebrew alphabet.

233
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,840
 And so this is a mother giving instruction to her children.

234
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,140
 Hey, this is what you look for.

235
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,540
 And here's the promises that it makes,

236
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,020
 that if you find this woman, it says,

237
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,380
 her husband is respected at the city gates

238
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,420
 where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.

239
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,180
 Every man here, ladies,

240
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,060
 I'm gonna give you some good advice here.

241
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,940
 Every man here wants to feel respected.

242
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,220
 He has a deep desire inside of him to feel respected.

243
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,600
 And specifically when he gets married,

244
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,940
 he wants to feel respected by his wife.

245
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,460
 This text says, hey, you find the right woman

246
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,780
 and you're gonna be respected not only by her,

247
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,180
 but all of the people of the land.

248
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,740
 It goes on to say the promise to the woman,

249
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,900
 it says that her children arise and call her blessed,

250
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,140
 her husband also, and he praises her.

251
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,780
 Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.

252
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,280
 This is the words of her husband.

253
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,580
 Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.

254
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,260
 And it says, and then the command to the guy,

255
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,420
 because this text was not written to women.

256
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,020
 This text, this is not the,

257
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,860
 hey, here's what you must be women.

258
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,060
 This is, hey guys, here's what you should value.

259
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,200
 Here's what you should look for.

260
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,580
 And it ends with an instruction to the men.

261
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,580
 It says this, honor her for all that her hands have done

262
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:50,140
 and let her works bring her praise at the city gates,

263
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,700
 which was not something that was done in Israel.

264
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,660
 And so this is extraordinary praise

265
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,480
 for an extraordinary woman.

266
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,680
 It is the gold standard.

267
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,860
 Ladies, can I tell you something?

268
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,900
 For the next few minutes,

269
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,060
 you're really gonna have to fight something.

270
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,960
 Comparison.

271
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,200
 All right, so let's resolve your heart right now

272
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,060
 that you don't let it turn downward,

273
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,340
 that you don't grow discouraged

274
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,780
 because there's hope in this text.

275
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,140
 So hang in there with me as we move through this text

276
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,440
 that it would not beat you down.

277
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,340
 And so Proverbs 31, we're gonna look at seven qualities.

278
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,380
 Yes, seven from this text.

279
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,060
 I've read commentaries that listed 31.

280
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,380
 I read commentaries that listed 10.

281
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,060
 I looked at here, I think we can dumb it down

282
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,580
 to seven qualities to look for as you're dating someone.

283
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,480
 What is dating?

284
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,540
 My friend Daniel Crawford next door,

285
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,460
 he gave me this definition, I love it.

286
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,280
 It says assessing someone's suitability as a spouse.

287
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,220
 How do I assess someone's suitability as a spouse?

288
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,780
 This text, men, this text will help you do that.

289
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,020
 Verse 10, let's go.

290
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,300
 A wife of noble character who can find,

291
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,900
 she is worth far more than rubies.

292
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,540
 Where it says a wife of noble character,

293
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,020
 it could also be translated in the Hebrew, a capable wife.

294
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,820
 Okay, it's saying, hey, this thing,

295
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,340
 you have to seek her out.

296
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,060
 She is difficult to find, but if you find her,

297
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,660
 she's more valuable than rubies.

298
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,340
 Right off the bat, you have an application,

299
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,060
 men, you have to find her,

300
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,020
 which means you have to look for her,

301
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,500
 which means you're going to have to take a risk.

302
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,260
 You're going to have to get out there and search for her.

303
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,140
 She is not, while you're watching the Cowboys game,

304
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,740
 gonna fall through the roof and land on your lap.

305
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,600
 That's not going to happen, all right?

306
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,020
 You have to seek this woman out.

307
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,100
 Her husband has full confidence in her

308
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,560
 and lacks nothing of value.

309
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,340
 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.

310
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,100
 And so it says right off the bat,

311
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,860
 what we're looking for, one of the qualities,

312
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,960
 you are looking for someone who is faithful.

313
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,100
 That's the first quality, faithful, you can write that down.

314
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,560
 She should be faithful.

315
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,080
 Now let's make that practical.

316
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,900
 What does that mean?

317
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,540
 It means she's trustworthy.

318
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,780
 It means that she does what she says she's going to do.

319
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,860
 You can ask yourself that question, what does she do?

320
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,020
 How do I know if she's faithful?

321
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,740
 Well, does she do what she says she's going to do?

322
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,620
 Does she use her words to build up?

323
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,960
 Does she gossip?

324
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,300
 Because that breaks trust.

325
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,220
 And you have to trust this woman.

326
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,300
 This is your life partner we're talking about.

327
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,460
 Like a marriage has to be built on trust.

328
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,180
 If there is no trust, there is no marriage.

329
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,740
 And so this woman should be known for her integrity.

330
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,980
 You know this is true if you've ever been

331
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,660
 in an untrustworthy relationship.

332
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,640
 It is miserable.

333
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,140
 I've been in one, you guys are nodding your head,

334
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,740
 getting whiplash back there.

335
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,580
 It is terrible.

336
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,620
 Causes you so much pain, you feel trapped in a prison,

337
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,540
 but you can't get out.

338
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,340
 And so this is a big problem.

339
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,340
 It's really interesting.

340
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,940
 Fox News two weeks ago actually asked me to write a response

341
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,940
 an article about this girl who made a list of 22 things

342
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,960
 that her boyfriend had to do.

343
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,220
 Did anybody see this?

344
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,060
 Yeah, here's a picture of this list.

345
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,660
 And so it's like, hey, you are not to have

346
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,140
 single girls numbers.

347
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,860
 If I text you, you have to get back.

348
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,280
 You have to respond within 10 minutes.

349
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,740
 If I catch you with another girl, I will kill you, okay?

350
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,580
 Wow.

351
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,540
 She says you can't hang out with these particular friends.

352
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,740
 All right, I'm looking at that.

353
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,580
 So I read it.

354
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,780
 They say, hey, we want you to write a response to this.

355
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,600
 I'm reading it.

356
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,980
 I'm like, man, my response is that that relationship

357
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,300
 is no longer intact.

358
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,820
 Okay, the way they found this list is this guy traded

359
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,060
 in his car and whoever got the car,

360
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,980
 the list was still in there.

361
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,820
 He posted it on the internet and said, oh, this poor soul.

362
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,500
 And it went mega viral, like worldwide viral.

363
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,900
 And so they said, hey, respond to this.

364
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,820
 And I said, listen, that marriage is doomed

365
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,440
 because there's no trust there.

366
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,740
 That's not healthy.

367
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,580
 You have to be able to trust each other.

368
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,260
 Now, listen, let me say this to you guys.

369
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
 Just because you don't trust her doesn't mean

370
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,520
 she's not trustworthy.

371
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,380
 (congregation laughing)

372
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,880
 Little subtle rumble there.

373
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,840
 Mm, a lot of, hey, just listen, dear in this message,

374
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,440
 let's not elbow each other, point, okay?

375
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,780
 Don't do that.

376
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,140
 Just because you don't trust her doesn't mean

377
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,300
 she's not trustworthy.

378
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,380
 It may be your issue.

379
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,660
 You may not be trustworthy.

380
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,540
 Untrustworthy people don't trust people.

381
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,900
 That's a fact.

382
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,660
 Untrustworthy people don't trust people

383
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,820
 because they're afraid that someone's gonna do to them

384
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,700
 what they're already doing behind their back.

385
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,360
 And so I'm talking about if you have evidence or proof

386
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 that, hey, she is not trustworthy or she is not faithful.

387
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,780
 And so if she's faithful, how does she care for her home?

388
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,260
 Verse 13, she selects wool and flax

389
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,940
 and works with eager hands.

390
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,940
 Flax is used to make a really fine linen.

391
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,240
 And where it says she's eager to use her hands,

392
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
 what it's actually saying is she enjoys it.

393
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,120
 Like she finds joy out of doing these things.

394
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,140
 In context, it says she is like the merchant ships

395
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,220
 bringing her food from afar,

396
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,660
 which is such a beautiful text because what it's saying is

397
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,340
 she's like the people, people who are around her

398
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,260
 are like the people standing at the docks.

399
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,900
 And when food comes in from all of these lands,

400
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,140
 it's exciting things.

401
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,660
 It's things they've never seen.

402
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,620
 It's saying that when you sit down to a meal

403
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,940
 that she's made, you don't know what it is.

404
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,220
 You don't know what to expect.

405
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,380
 It could be anything.

406
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,420
 She's not serving you hamburger helper.

407
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,900
 Like she's coming up with creative things,

408
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,700
 which I just love that that's in the text.

409
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,580
 It says she gets up while it is still night.

410
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,940
 She provides food for her family

411
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,660
 and portions for her female servants.

412
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,100
 What this text is saying is she's able to assess

413
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,180
 the needs of her family.

414
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,420
 And so my second quality to look for is,

415
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,260
 is she attentive to the needs of her home?

416
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,900
 Attentive to the needs of her home.

417
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,580
 This is something that you're going to want

418
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,140
 in someone that you're going to spend

419
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,300
 the rest of your life with.

420
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,620
 What does that mean?

421
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,420
 Practically speaking, it's talking about

422
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,020
 her caring for her family.

423
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,540
 Does she love children?

424
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,140
 You're like, well, how do I know if she loves children?

425
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,820
 Well, she wants to be around them.

426
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,380
 You know, I'm gonna babysit,

427
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,620
 I'm gonna keep so and so's, you know,

428
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,820
 I just love their kids, you know.

429
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,100
 Love when they're around.

430
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,260
 Why is that important?

431
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,260
 Well, because a huge part of marriage is raising children.

432
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,140
 And what I've seen in the generations that are,

433
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,540
 my generation and the generation behind me,

434
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,140
 Gen Z, is we get self-absorbed and selfish

435
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,020
 and we start to think, you know,

436
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,940
 I don't, kids kind of get in the way.

437
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,180
 I mean, I do weddings sometimes where we're talking

438
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,380
 with people, they're like, well, you know,

439
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,740
 yeah, we're gonna travel the world and then we'll have kids.

440
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,140
 And I'm like, what I would tell you is travel the world now

441
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,420
 because marriage is about family.

442
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,140
 And what God's view of kids is,

443
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,580
 he says they're a blessing from the Lord.

444
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,780
 Have lots of them.

445
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,860
 That's what the Lord says.

446
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,940
 And so if you don't view kids as a blessing,

447
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,100
 you don't view children like God does.

448
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,260
 And you should consider that.

449
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,300
 Now, listen, if you can't have kids,

450
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,580
 that's not a disqualifier at all.

451
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,500
 You can adopt, you can decide.

452
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,420
 I've got a friend in ministry that he and his wife,

453
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,300
 they never had children, but they have poured their life

454
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,300
 into millions, literally millions of kids.

455
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,500
 That's a life well-lived.

456
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,020
 And so what does it look like to love children?

457
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,260
 This woman has skills, you know, to make a house a home.

458
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,420
 Homemaker is such, like it has negative connotation today.

459
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,300
 I reject that because I think God's word rejects that.

460
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,460
 It is a compliment.

461
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,420
 It is a gift.

462
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,140
 And so here's the encouragement to you, ladies,

463
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,700
 is if you're like out there and you're like,

464
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,460
 yeah, but that's not me.

465
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,420
 You know, this is a great time to work on those skills.

466
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,420
 It's not a non-negotiable for you.

467
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,420
 I'll just say, like my wife, she doesn't love to cook.

468
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,100
 It's, she has a ton of gifts, like a long list of gifts.

469
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,460
 Cooking's not like on the first couple of pages.

470
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,140
 And so we eat out a lot and that's okay.

471
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,740
 I like to eat out and so we've got a budget, we stick to it.

472
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
 It works, we've had a great marriage.

473
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,340
 And so I'm not, don't be discouraged if that's not you,

474
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,620
 but this is something that is straight from this proverb.

475
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,780
 And so I'm putting it before you.

476
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,460
 And so right now there's some women in the room,

477
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,500
 they're like, oh, but you know,

478
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,700
 he's against, you know, working outside the home

479
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,540
 and you know, this and that.

480
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540
 No, not at all, no.

481
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
 This woman works outside the home.

482
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,580
 This text goes out of its way to show

483
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,980
 that this woman works outside the home.

484
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,220
 She works outside the home, she works inside the home.

485
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,140
 She does a lot of work.

486
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,980
 That's this woman, Proverbs 31 here.

487
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
 But let me show you that she works outside the home.

488
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,900
 It's 16, she considers a field and buys it.

489
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,340
 Out of her earnings, she plants a vineyard.

490
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,620
 She sets about her work vigorously.

491
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,380
 Her arms are strong for her tasks.

492
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
 And so men, what you're looking for,

493
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,660
 a woman with big arms, okay?

494
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,940
 That's gonna be important.

495
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,820
 She sees that her trading is profitable

496
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,740
 and her lamp does not go out at night.

497
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,100
 In her hand, she holds the distaff

498
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,820
 and grasps the spindle for her fingers.

499
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,500
 A distaff is something for sewing or knitting.

500
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,420
 And then also in verse 24, it says,

501
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,740
 she makes linen garments and sells them

502
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,460
 and supplies the merchants with sashes.

503
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,500
 This lady is getting after it.

504
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,020
 She has jobs upon jobs outside the home, okay?

505
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,860
 That's the truth.

506
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,300
 And so my third quality that you're looking for,

507
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,880
 that you would consider is that she's not lazy.

508
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,300
 That she's not lazy.

509
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,420
 She's going to have to do a lot of work.

510
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,580
 Men, here's why.

511
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,060
 Because being married to you is a lot of work.

512
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,380
 (congregation laughing)

513
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,780
 And I know from experience,

514
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,620
 being married to me is a lot of work, okay?

515
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,460
 A lot of work.

516
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,980
 And so it's, listen, marriage is hard.

517
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,900
 You guys ever heard that, marriage is hard?

518
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,740
 You ever heard that?

519
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,940
 Anybody sick of hearing that?

520
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,300
 I'm so sick of hearing how marriage, how hard it is.

521
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,540
 Let me tell you the truth.

522
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,740
 Let me tell you the truth.

523
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,820
 Life is hard.

524
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,700
 That's the truth.

525
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
 Men, let me talk to you for a minute.

526
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,100
 Men, life is hard.

527
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,100
 That's why you need a helper.

528
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,820
 That's what the scripture calls a wife, a helper.

529
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,100
 Can I tell you something before you get offended

530
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,940
 and walk out?

531
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,180
 It's what the scripture calls the Holy Spirit, God,

532
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,300
 a helper.

533
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,300
 And I'm not saying that you can't be a helper.

534
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,140
 You can be a helper.

535
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,460
 And do you know why you need a helper, men?

536
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,220
 Because we need help.

537
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
 That's simple, right?

538
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,140
 We're just some dudes that need some help.

539
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,340
 And so God in his kindness is like, hey, let me help you.

540
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,540
 I will not only give you my Holy Spirit to help you,

541
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,220
 but I will create an amazing, beautiful creature

542
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,220
 that is as incredible in the way that he's wired her

543
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,060
 to come alongside you.

544
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,900
 And so, you know, it's going to be important

545
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,100
 that she is not lazy,

546
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,740
 because the job before you, and it's not just marriage,

547
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,460
 it's life, is hard.

548
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,740
 Like I've got a hard job.

549
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,940
 You know, I love my job.

550
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
 I love where I work.

551
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,620
 I love who I work with.

552
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,260
 But I write a term paper every week.

553
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,540
 I listen to, in the form of a sermon,

554
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,620
 I listen to people's problems every day.

555
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,980
 You know, there's some difficulties with it.

556
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,820
 Let me tell you something.

557
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,860
 I couldn't trade my wife for her job, not for one second.

558
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,340
 I am not one of those dudes like,

559
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,180
 my job's harder than hers.

560
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,580
 No, her job is so much harder than mine.

561
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,780
 It's so much harder than mine.

562
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,340
 And so as you think about marriage,

563
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,100
 you need to know what the job is in order to find

564
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,580
 the person that you're going to partner with.

565
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,420
 Okay?

566
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,240
 Like, let me just tell you,

567
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,900
 'cause I know you're thinking, well, you know,

568
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,940
 I just want someone who's fun and hot.

569
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,660
 This actually comes from the book, if you've read it.

570
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,860
 And so when I was in high school,

571
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,940
 I had this huge crush with this girl in my class.

572
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,780
 We'll call her Kelly.

573
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,900
 It's a made up name.

574
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,660
 And we were being partnered up,

575
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,140
 guys and girls being partnered up.

576
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,900
 And so I'm sitting there and the teacher's going around

577
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,380
 and I'm like, please, please put me with Kelly.

578
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,220
 Please.

579
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,140
 I'm like, I don't even believe in God,

580
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,260
 but I'm like, God, please put me with Kelly.

581
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,100
 And at the time, and I believe in God now,

582
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,380
 just in case you were wondering.

583
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,140
 Big, big fan of God.

584
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,300
 And so she's going around and she's like, okay,

585
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,980
 we'll do Jeff and Elizabeth.

586
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,440
 All right, we're going to do John and Jennifer.

587
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,400
 And then she's like, all right, we'll do Jonathan.

588
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,620
 And I'm like, please, please, Jesus, please.

589
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,300
 Kelly, I'm like, yes.

590
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,140
 You know?

591
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,060
 And because I was attracted to Kelly, she was attractive.

592
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,900
 And the assignment was,

593
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,460
 I just didn't consider what the assignment was.

594
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,140
 The assignment was we were going to dissect frogs.

595
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,740
 And Kelly was cute, but she hated frogs,

596
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,980
 especially the dead kind.

597
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,540
 And she didn't want to touch them at all.

598
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,660
 And that was challenging

599
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,460
 because I wasn't very good at biology.

600
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,220
 And I was really hoping that she was going to be smart.

601
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,600
 And, you know, and so now we are in this partnership

602
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,840
 and she's not very good at the assignment.

603
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,020
 And that describes more than half of the marriages I see.

604
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,340
 I just chose someone.

605
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,140
 I didn't consider what the assignment was, right?

606
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,660
 I just were hoping they would be good at sex.

607
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,540
 Not the 99.4% of all the other stuff

608
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,800
 we talked about last week.

609
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,700
 The sex, if you have a lot of it,

610
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,240
 a lot of it is 0.6% of the time.

611
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,000
 What about the 99.4% of all the other stuff?

612
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,100
 You want to make sure that you both are good at that.

613
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,260
 It's interesting.

614
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,980
 Like we make so much decisions.

615
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,500
 I'm talking to you guys.

616
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,220
 So much decisions around sex.

617
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,420
 I just think that's true in dating.

618
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,260
 And a big driver for that is like,

619
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,580
 I want her to be attractive.

620
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,740
 Is sex better with attractive people?

621
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,060
 Don't answer out loud.

622
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,980
 I mean, just, just think about it.

623
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,780
 I'm just gonna let you think about it.

624
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
 I'm just gonna let you think about it.

625
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,780
 She opens her arms to the poor

626
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,880
 and extends her hands to the needy.

627
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,300
 Another quality, my fourth quality that marks this woman

628
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,020
 is that she's tender to the needs of others.

629
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,700
 Keep in mind, this is the gold standard, all right?

630
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,620
 These are not all non-negotiables.

631
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,440
 These are good ideas if they're there.

632
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,460
 This is what a mother prayed for her son.

633
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,680
 She's tender to the needs of others.

634
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,300
 And so is she tender to the needs of, JP, how would I know?

635
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,660
 Does she text encouraging things to people

636
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,500
 when they need it?

637
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,380
 Does she lift their spirits?

638
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,820
 Is she writing notes?

639
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,820
 Is she thinking about the needs of others around her?

640
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,380
 Does she desire to give?

641
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,580
 Is she serving, right?

642
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,500
 This is so big.

643
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,340
 Is she serving?

644
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,220
 That's like half the battle.

645
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,540
 Is she involved in a church?

646
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,620
 And serving there, giving of her time there.

647
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,460
 This is huge.

648
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,340
 It comes from Genesis chapter 24.

649
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,060
 Here's what's going on.

650
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,380
 Abraham, you guys heard of Abraham?

651
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,300
 Abraham is looking for a wife for his son, Isaac.

652
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,140
 And so what he does, and we can learn a lot from this,

653
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,940
 he gets his servant, Eleazar, and he says,

654
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,740
 "Hey, I want you to go and find my son a wife."

655
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,820
 Right, now this is crazy that Eleazar

656
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,060
 can find Isaac a wife when they haven't met or anything

657
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,700
 because he knows what he's looking for.

658
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,980
 That's the difference between us and them.

659
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,060
 See, in Bible times, you literally could just

660
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,180
 leave the house with a list.

661
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,420
 You could go up to somebody like,

662
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,440
 "Check, check, check, check, I do."

663
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,620
 You know, I mean, you could do that then, right?

664
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,140
 And we've complicated things since then.

665
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,240
 And so Eleazar leaves, and he's looking,

666
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,340
 and he's like, "So where does he go?"

667
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,940
 He goes where servants hang out.

668
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,140
 He goes to the well, and he prays.

669
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,620
 He says, "Lord, would you send someone to me

670
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,300
 "who is a servant, who would not only give me water,

671
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,160
 "but also water my camels?"

672
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,580
 Now, a well in those times, it was like a flight of stairs

673
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,540
 that went into the ground.

674
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,140
 It was hard work to fill up buckets of water

675
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,520
 and then walk those stories of stairs.

676
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,660
 And then Rebekah comes up and says,

677
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,580
 "Here's some water, and let me go

678
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,220
 "and also get some for your camels."

679
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,620
 And so he's looking for someone who serves.

680
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,700
 He goes where servants go,

681
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,900
 and he chooses someone who served.

682
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,300
 This is such a novel idea.

683
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,940
 And then they get married.

684
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,460
 And it was that simple.

685
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,160
 Why is it not that simple anymore?

686
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,940
 Gotta have chemistry, JP, chemistry.

687
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,620
 So important.

688
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,240
 (JP sighs)

689
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,140
 My bride, she has this in spades.

690
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,860
 Super sensitive to the needs of others.

691
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,940
 Like she goes, she comes into a room,

692
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,660
 and it's like her superpower, okay?

693
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,060
 She's a kindergarten teacher,

694
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,060
 and she just like walks into a room,

695
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,400
 and she finds the most vulnerable person

696
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,420
 and just moves to them.

697
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,700
 It's like a magic trick she does.

698
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,860
 Like whether it's a baby or an elderly person

699
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,380
 or someone who had a bad day,

700
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,760
 I mean, she can just smell it from across the room

701
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,860
 and move to 'em and just love on 'em

702
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,800
 and encourage 'em like crazy.

703
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,100
 I mean, she is nurturer through and through.

704
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,020
 And so our marriage faced a really big challenge this year.

705
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,360
 I mean, probably one of the biggest challenges

706
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,380
 in 14 years of marriage.

707
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,540
 We got a puppy.

708
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,500
 And so just, I thought,

709
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,300
 you know, we're gonna let the puppy inside,

710
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,460
 and it's gonna be all good.

711
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,980
 And I didn't consider how nurturing she is.

712
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,020
 And she likes to put ice in the bowl

713
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,740
 and make sure the water's of a good temperature

714
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,820
 and that it's comfortable and that the TV's on

715
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,060
 when we're not there so they're entertained.

716
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,700
 And that's all lost on me.

717
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,980
 I'm like, we're not doing any of that.

718
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,640
 You know, we're not, no.

719
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,340
 Okay, fine.

720
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,740
 And so, you know, and if I'm honest with you,

721
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,980
 if I'm just putting it all out there,

722
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,340
 I'm jealous of the dog.

723
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,260
 I'm like, stop showing her so much attention, you know?

724
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,700
 I'm over here, you know?

725
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,540
 And,

726
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:43,320
 and I know that I need a little bit more

727
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,300
 of that in my life.

728
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,560
 Like, I think Christ would walk into a room,

729
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,620
 I know he would, in fact,

730
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,500
 and be finally in tune with the greatest needs

731
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,620
 and move to the person who is most vulnerable.

732
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,400
 And so, you know, are they tender to the needs of others?

733
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,560
 Do they tend to the needs of others?

734
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,520
 Are they tender to the needs of others?

735
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,960
 It goes on to say, verse 21,

736
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,380
 when it snows, she has no fear for her household,

737
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,040
 for all of them are clothed in scarlet.

738
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,080
 She makes coverings for her bed.

739
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,040
 She is clothed in fine linen and purple.

740
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,520
 I want to focus on the clothed in scarlet

741
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,000
 and she's clothed in fine linen and purple

742
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,440
 and she makes coverings for her bed.

743
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,080
 And so this is kind of a strange one,

744
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,760
 but if I, I just, I see it clearly in the text.

745
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,800
 And so number five, aesthete.

746
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,160
 Okay, anybody heard of this word, aesthete?

747
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,960
 I hadn't either.

748
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,880
 Is she aesthete?

749
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,720
 Here's what it means.

750
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,440
 It's where we get the word aesthetics.

751
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,480
 Does she care about making things pretty?

752
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
 And you're like, really?

753
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,800
 That's like on the list of non-negotiable,

754
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,640
 dude, it's from Proverbs 31, all right?

755
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
 You argue with the scripture.

756
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,200
 But here's why I think the Holy Spirit

757
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
 preserved this text for thousands of years

758
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,320
 so that we can read it and apply it to our lives today.

759
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,000
 It's because if I'm honest,

760
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,380
 like as I just think through the sexes and the genders

761
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,460
 and the roles that we play,

762
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,640
 you know, a lot of guys don't care if things are pretty.

763
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,320
 And God's like, I like things to be pretty, I'm a creator.

764
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,240
 And so if you're gonna have a home,

765
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,320
 I want things to be pretty.

766
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,560
 Guys are kind of like function over,

767
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
 I'm sorry, function over form.

768
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,720
 Like we just want things to work, right?

769
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,800
 And we don't care if they're pretty.

770
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,280
 And girls are like, no, I want it to work

771
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,380
 and I want it to look good, right?

772
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,720
 And so you make your home pretty.

773
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,160
 And so you know that if you think I'm lying, right?

774
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,880
 Like you know that you went to some guy's apartment

775
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,960
 and you had to go to the bathroom

776
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,360
 and you went somewhere else.

777
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,120
 You're like, I am not going in there.

778
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,360
 It is a biological experiment in there

779
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,840
 and I'm not setting foot in his bed.

780
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,620
 He's growing mold in there, right?

781
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,220
 And that's just what some guys do.

782
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,560
 And I'm telling you, these aren't non-negotiables.

783
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,120
 And so Monica and I had the opportunity to build a house

784
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,480
 and you know, people will walk in and say,

785
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,400
 oh, is that Monica?

786
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,240
 Oh, did she do?

787
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,560
 And I'm like, nope, that was me.

788
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,300
 And so I tend to be the one in the relationship

789
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,560
 that cares more about this.

790
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,400
 And so that's okay.

791
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,480
 Like if that's where you're at,

792
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,360
 you're finding balance, you know how God made you,

793
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,760
 how God wired you up and you're looking for someone

794
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,920
 to compliment that.

795
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,880
 And so that's all right.

796
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,480
 Again, these aren't non-negotiables,

797
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,280
 not all of them anyways.

798
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,840
 And so it says she is clothed with strength and dignity.

799
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,760
 She can laugh at the days to come.

800
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,120
 She speaks with wisdom and faithful instruction

801
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,000
 is on her tongue.

802
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,360
 She watches over the affairs of her household

803
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,520
 and does not eat the bread of idleness.

804
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,720
 Another quality is she's sensible in preparation.

805
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,560
 That's number six.

806
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,920
 She is sensible in preparation.

807
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,640
 Sensible means chosen in accordance with wisdom.

808
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,120
 She makes choices according to the knowledge that she has.

809
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,160
 It says that she speaks with wisdom.

810
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,120
 She's clothed in strength and dignity.

811
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,000
 And it says that she can laugh at the days to come

812
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,980
 because she's prepared.

813
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,400
 So as she looks at the challenges that they're facing,

814
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,880
 she has a plan for that.

815
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,440
 She's prepared for that.

816
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,520
 And she watches over the affairs of her household.

817
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,420
 She is not idle.

818
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,960
 She shows care for the future.

819
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,080
 This also comes from verse 18 where it says,

820
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,160
 "Her lamp does not go out at night."

821
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,680
 Like the virgins who stopped preparing

822
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,400
 and they let their lamps go out in the New Testament,

823
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,460
 that phrase in the Hebrew, lamps do not go out at night,

824
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,120
 means she's prepared.

825
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,040
 She has a plan.

826
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,260
 Now I'm not saying that she's OCD.

827
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,920
 I'm not saying that she's super high strung,

828
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,320
 like constantly planning.

829
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,560
 I'm just saying that she's not given to manis and pettis

830
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,280
 and happy hours and spray tanning

831
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,000
 over actually getting ready

832
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,080
 for what she needs to be getting ready for.

833
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,320
 Like being aware of what is coming at her.

834
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,640
 And this preparedness, it leads to confidence.

835
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,260
 It says she laughs at the days to come.

836
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,440
 And so on our kitchen table,

837
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,600
 you walk into my house at any given time,

838
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,040
 and right there on the kitchen table is my wife's chair.

839
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,520
 And on her chair is a purse.

840
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,560
 And in the chair is her Bible study bag,

841
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,360
 which is like books and books.

842
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,540
 And then on the table is an old school calendar

843
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,240
 that she buys every January from Barnes and Noble.

844
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,840
 And she, at night, we put the kids down

845
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,300
 and she sits down in that chair and she just goes to work.

846
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,840
 Man, she's got colored markers.

847
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,280
 She's got a marker for every color of her thoughts,

848
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,080
 you know, and just like writing down on Tuesday.

849
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,360
 Tuesday, you're going, where are you traveling?

850
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,320
 Okay, and you're speaking, okay.

851
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,880
 And then Thursday, what are we doing?

852
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,440
 This weekend, we got soccer games and this.

853
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,380
 And she's just, you know, marking stuff up,

854
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,800
 grabbing the yellow and the red and the green.

855
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
 And she just does it every night.

856
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,540
 I'm so glad she does 'cause I'm awful at that.

857
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,600
 And so here in Dallas, it's been raining since 2012.

858
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,600
 And so we've like rescheduled all of the soccer games,

859
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,020
 the kids' soccer games.

860
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,440
 Basically, we have to play a whole season of soccer games

861
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,960
 in two weeks, that's a true story.

862
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,720
 And so that's just meant, that's changed everything.

863
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,080
 So the sun came out and so did soccer games.

864
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,000
 And so she's just writing, okay, we can't do that.

865
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,760
 We've got a soccer game, soccer game, soccer game.

866
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,160
 And it's like playing Tetris, moving this stuff around,

867
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,360
 but she's great at it.

868
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,600
 And it's so helpful.

869
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,200
 And so I'm not saying that your wife can't be spontaneous.

870
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,800
 I'm not saying she can't be artsy and fun,

871
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,420
 but I am saying that what this mama prayed for her son

872
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,420
 is that he would find someone who's sensible in preparation.

873
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,620
 And then it says, verse 30,

874
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,020
 "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting."

875
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,180
 My daughters say this verse every day to me

876
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,160
 before they get out of the car for school.

877
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,100
 "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,

878
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,500
 but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."

879
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:14,500
 I love what the author is doing here.

880
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,300
 They juxtapose chemistry with the fear of God.

881
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,620
 And so you say, what does the Bible value?

882
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,940
 I would say the Bible values the fear of God

883
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,180
 infinitely times more than chemistry.

884
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,480
 That's the truth.

885
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,540
 And I use infinitely more.

886
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,100
 That's not, I'm not even over speaking.

887
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,380
 Like I could say a hundred times more, a thousand times more,

888
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,860
 infinitely times more, the Bible values,

889
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,620
 the wisdom of God and the Holy Spirit values

890
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,380
 the fear of God over chemistry.

891
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,340
 And so my seventh quality is she yielded to God.

892
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,920
 Ladies, I want you to be encouraged

893
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,920
 because this is really the only one that's a non-negotiable.

894
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,640
 The other ones are, they're nice to have.

895
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,740
 They may help you be prepared.

896
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,560
 But as I said last week,

897
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,980
 what if it's as simple as finding

898
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,260
 the most godly person you can,

899
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,780
 being the most godly person you can

900
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,840
 and finding the most godly person you can and marrying them?

901
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,720
 What if it's that simple?

902
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,380
 What if we've complicated things?

903
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,540
 And so number seven, they have to be yielded to God.

904
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,860
 Here's what that means is there's people listening right now

905
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,620
 here in Dallas and Fort Worth, El Paso, Tulsa,

906
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,700
 driving in their car, streaming on the internet,

907
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,720
 sitting in their apartment,

908
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,420
 and you don't even know God and you're not dateable.

909
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,340
 You're not marriage material.

910
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,020
 Followers of Jesus should run from you as fast as they can

911
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,420
 unless they're seeking to share the gospel with you.

912
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,660
 And even in that, I'd encourage you

913
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,220
 to find someone of the same sex.

914
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,460
 And so what you need to do, the good news is,

915
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,340
 it's very simple.

916
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,140
 What you need to hear is that Jesus Christ,

917
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,380
 that God loves you so much,

918
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,740
 he sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to this earth

919
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,680
 to die for your sins, to pay the price for your sins

920
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,300
 so that you don't have to go to hell

921
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,740
 and pay the price for your sins.

922
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,980
 Your sins have been paid for on the cross.

923
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,100
 And that God, to show his infinite power,

924
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,300
 he raised his son, Jesus, from the dead.

925
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,360
 It really happened.

926
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,860
 That's how he became the single most notorious character

927
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,540
 in the history of history.

928
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,000
 He rose from the dead.

929
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,300
 Paul says there's 500 people who saw him.

930
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,140
 They're still alive.

931
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,380
 Go ask them, he writes to the Corinthians.

932
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,560
 And when we trust in him that he died for our sins,

933
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,500
 God raised him from the dead,

934
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,960
 his Holy Spirit comes in our lives.

935
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,580
 And here's the other good news, ladies.

936
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,700
 What that Holy Spirit does is it makes you godly.

937
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,060
 So if you're sitting out there and you're like,

938
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,300
 man, I'm just not there, I'm not perfect,

939
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,500
 you don't need to be perfect.

940
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,020
 You have a savior who's perfect,

941
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,260
 and his Holy Spirit is working inside of you

942
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,800
 to one day complete you

943
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,140
 so that you would be perfect before Christ

944
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,420
 until then you live in an imperfect world

945
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,780
 and you don't need to be perfect.

946
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,980
 Guys, I'm talking to you now.

947
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,100
 Gentlemen, I'm talking to you.

948
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,540
 You're not looking for perfect,

949
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,000
 you're looking for practical.

950
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,320
 You're not looking for someone who's perfectly made for you

951
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,640
 because she doesn't exist, because you are so messed up.

952
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,640
 You're looking for someone who practically compliments you

953
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,280
 so that you can marry and serve God together.

954
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,520
 They love God, you love God, you come together,

955
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,260
 you love God together, and you raise children to love God.

956
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,400
 You have them, you adopt them, you disciple them

957
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,800
 however you can.

958
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,700
 This is God's plan for the world.

959
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,360
 At some point we moved away from it.

960
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,680
 When did we move away from it?

961
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,320
 When did our selfishness infiltrate this plan?

962
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,280
 Are we more happy?

963
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,120
 No.

964
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,940
 Are we happier?

965
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,780
 No.

966
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,600
 Are we more depressed?

967
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,440
 Yes.

968
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,280
 Are we despairing more?

969
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,100
 Yes.

970
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,160
 Are suicide rates at an all-time high?

971
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,360
 Yes, they are.

972
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,300
 What if we just went back to the basics?

973
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,100
 What if we just started to learn from the creator?

974
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,180
 We went back to his design, and we said,

975
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,320
 okay, I'm gonna scrub out all the trash

976
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,760
 that Hollywood taught me, and I'm just gonna go back to this.

977
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,780
 Listen, my wife and I, we weren't following Christ

978
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,620
 when we met.

979
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,940
 We were idiots.

980
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,000
 I was a bigger idiot than she was,

981
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,420
 but both of us were not following Christ.

982
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,940
 And around the same time, God in his mercy

983
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,700
 introduced us to him through his son, Jesus Christ,

984
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,020
 and our lives began to radically change.

985
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,160
 And marriage was not an option for us until then.

986
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,060
 You know what our relationship looked like before then?

987
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,340
 We would get together, we'd break up,

988
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,320
 we'd get together, we'd break up.

989
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,200
 I love you, I hate you, you walk home,

990
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
 I never wanna see you again.

991
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
 You did what with who, when, where, why?

992
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,980
 Talking to me.

993
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:48,440
 And then God came into our lives and began to sanctify us,

994
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,920
 that is, making us like him.

995
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,200
 And as we began to pursue him together,

996
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,160
 he did a work in our relationships.

997
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,860
 And this work is available to you.

998
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,440
 Man, you're not looking for the perfect,

999
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
 you're looking for practical.

1000
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:18,860
 Chemistry, biblically speaking, how important is chemistry?

1001
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,520
 It's not.

1002
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,760
 Some of you, you haven't experienced chemistry, men,

1003
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,280
 because you've experienced chemistry

1004
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,860
 with thousands of two-dimensional images on your iPhone

1005
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,200
 for the past six years, or 16 years.

1006
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,720
 And so chemistry, long-term, is not available to you.

1007
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,480
 You need to get well, gentlemen.

1008
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,040
 You need to heal.

1009
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,720
 You need to return to the gospel.

1010
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,800
 But if you are well, and you desire marriage,

1011
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,520
 it is available to you.

1012
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,040
 There are godly women all around you right now.

1013
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,920
 Just because she's here doesn't mean she's godly,

1014
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,520
 but I know there are godly women all around you,

1015
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,720
 sitting in front of you, and beside you,

1016
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,280
 and behind you, take notice.

1017
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,640
 And so I get it all the time.

1018
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,600
 Let me just address this.

1019
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,120
 It's like, what if I'm not attracted to her?

1020
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,900
 What if I'm not attracted to her?

1021
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,520
 Your friend told me last week, lovingly, just said,

1022
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,440
 you know, I feel like you're saying,

1023
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,040
 like, if I'm dating someone who's godly,

1024
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,240
 like, they're really godly, they have a God-fearing heart,

1025
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,760
 but I just not feeling it, and I break up,

1026
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,400
 I feel like you're saying something's wrong with me.

1027
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,100
 So here's how I responded to that.

1028
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,080
 That's exactly what I'm saying.

1029
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,040
 There is something wrong with you.

1030
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,720
 It's called sin.

1031
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,120
 It's wrong with all of us.

1032
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,380
 And we're not attracted to yet

1033
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,560
 the things that God's attracted to.

1034
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,880
 In 1 Samuel 16, he says,

1035
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,800
 "I do not look at the outer appearance.

1036
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,320
 "I look at the heart.

1037
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,840
 "I'm attracted to the heart."

1038
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,900
 And so you say, well, what do I do?

1039
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,800
 Am I just supposed to marry them?

1040
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,780
 No, absolutely not.

1041
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,360
 No, no, you break up, and you work on you.

1042
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,840
 And you go, and you say, God, why am I not attracted

1043
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,620
 to the things that you're attracted to?

1044
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,760
 Would you grow me spiritually to the point

1045
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,360
 where I would be attracted to the things

1046
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,600
 that you're attracted to?

1047
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,800
 Right, what role does chemistry or attraction play

1048
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,840
 in an arranged marriage,

1049
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,640
 which is our example in biblical times.

1050
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,800
 I know it's not much today anymore,

1051
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,080
 but in biblical times, Eliezer,

1052
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,660
 Isaac had never seen Rebekah.

1053
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,720
 He didn't have a choice

1054
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,780
 whether he was physically attracted to her or not.

1055
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,600
 He just entrusted that huge decision to someone else

1056
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,360
 because that someone knew what they were looking for.

1057
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,200
 Gentlemen, you gotta know what you're looking for.

1058
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,160
 It says in verse 31, honor her

1059
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,760
 for all that her hands have done,

1060
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,600
 and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.

1061
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,040
 Honor her.

1062
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,320
 To love and to cherish, we say at a wedding, honor her.

1063
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,920
 Okay, what if I'm not attracted?

1064
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,560
 You have to, you ready, gentlemen?

1065
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,520
 There's the answer to that question.

1066
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,020
 You have to be able to cherish her.

1067
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,320
 If you can't cherish her, don't waste her time

1068
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,240
 for two seconds, but for the rest of your life,

1069
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,540
 you have to be able to choose to cherish her

1070
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,720
 because there will be times when she's not attractive

1071
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,300
 to you, there will be times

1072
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,200
 where you don't find her attractive.

1073
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,040
 That's the truth.

1074
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,400
 She's not gonna find you attractive either on days,

1075
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,460
 seasons, months at a time, that's going to happen,

1076
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,480
 but you have to choose to cherish her in those moments.

1077
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,960
 In fact, there's a ballet guy,

1078
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,860
 are they called ballerinas too?

1079
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,640
 They are, you sure?

1080
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,000
 Okay, 'cause this is going on the podcast

1081
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,700
 and I don't want, it's like forever on there.

1082
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,340
 Okay, dude ballerina, that's what they're called.

1083
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:53,060
 And he said, he just said, hey, ballet is about the woman.

1084
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:58,960
 And he said, my job as her partner is to highlight her.

1085
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,840
 He said, to make the beautiful more beautiful.

1086
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,220
 And he said, she's amazing on her own,

1087
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,100
 but with me, she can fly higher.

1088
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 And people come to see her display the art and the beauty.

1089
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,100
 And when I say cherish, man, that's what I'm talking about,

1090
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,440
 that you would get with that woman

1091
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,340
 and that you would highlight her beauty

1092
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,940
 'cause you know who's beautiful?

1093
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,780
 A woman who is well-loved is beautiful.

1094
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,180
 When someone is loved well, they become more beautiful

1095
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,740
 and more beautiful and more beautiful.

1096
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,320
 George Strait was right when he said,

1097
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,620
 you look so good in love.

1098
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,980
 And that was George Strait, right?

1099
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,240
 Okay, good, I thought it was ludicrous, but.

1100
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,160
 (congregation laughing)

1101
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,120
 Oh, he's a fantasy guy.

1102
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,940
 Anyways, here's the reality.

1103
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,720
 You show me a woman who's been loved well,

1104
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,920
 and I will show you someone who's beautiful.

1105
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,320
 And so if you wanna be married

1106
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,920
 to someone who's hot, gentlemen,

1107
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,880
 you marry someone and you love them like crazy.

1108
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,580
 You cherish them, that's the truth.

1109
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,800
 That's the reality.

1110
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,320
 I've seen a lot of beautiful women jump into marriages

1111
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,280
 and fade like flowers, cut from their source

1112
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,140
 because they didn't marry cherishing husbands.

1113
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,800
 And so what's not in this list, right?

1114
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,260
 Age isn't in this list.

1115
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:36,000
 She's, you know, that doesn't value.

1116
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,240
 If she's older than you, she may be an amazing wife.

1117
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,440
 It doesn't say, is she a virgin?

1118
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,880
 Doesn't say, does she have kids?

1119
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,960
 There's some amazing women here who have children

1120
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,860
 that would be incredible wives to you.

1121
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,360
 Can she have kids?

1122
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,480
 That's not on the list.

1123
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,760
 Is she a good kisser?

1124
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,480
 It's dumb, I know, you're gonna laugh 'cause it's stupid.

1125
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,500
 Does she come from a good family?

1126
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,240
 What does she look like?

1127
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,740
 None of this stuff's on there.

1128
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,260
 Are you asking the right questions?

1129
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,600
 I know you think through the lens of sex, I get it,

1130
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,040
 'cause I do too.

1131
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,480
 Here, let me say something crazy.

1132
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,020
 If she has all of these things,

1133
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,880
 but y'all can't even have sex,

1134
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,480
 you can't experience intimacy,

1135
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,760
 your marriage is going to be better

1136
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,100
 than if she has none of these things,

1137
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,760
 but she's amazing in bed.

1138
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,220
 Get your head around that.

1139
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,840
 That's true.

1140
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,680
 You say, well, how do you know?

1141
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,240
 'Cause I talk to a lot of people.

1142
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,200
 They'll talk to pastors about anything.

1143
00:48:51,200 --> 00:49:00,200
 In summary, is she faithful?

1144
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,920
 Is she attentive to the needs of her home?

1145
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,160
 Is she not lazy?

1146
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,000
 Is she tender to the needs of others?

1147
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,320
 Is she aesthete?

1148
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,840
 Is she sensible in preparations?

1149
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,120
 And is she yielded to God?

1150
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:28,460
 (congregation applauding)

1151
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,460
 - After you.

1152
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,300
 (congregation laughing)

1153
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:43,300
 - And hey, that's a fantasy girl.

1154
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,100
 That last one, that's the most important one.

1155
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,220
 You get that last one, that's the non-negotiable.

1156
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,780
 There's other things, those are good.

1157
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,940
 You take 'em, you get a little more, a little less,

1158
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,940
 you're mixing up the smoothie,

1159
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,580
 give me more of that, a little less of that.

1160
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,860
 Those things, you know, you want her to be faithful, right?

1161
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,660
 They're not all created equal, okay?

1162
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,300
 You might be able to get by with her not being aesthete,

1163
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,340
 right, but she needs to be yielded to God.

1164
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,000
 And then to find someone yielded to God,

1165
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,700
 you need to be yielded to God, right?

1166
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,540
 And that's the truth.

1167
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,940
 It's funny, we just think about this all wrong.

1168
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,580
 That guy was making that smoothie up there.

1169
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,100
 I'm like, dude, I don't want anything to do with that, right?

1170
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,060
 I'm out on that.

1171
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,940
 He mixes it up and he pours me a little Dixie cup

1172
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,660
 and hands 'em out to my kids and to me,

1173
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,500
 and I'm like, I don't even want it.

1174
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,700
 I'm like with my nine-year-old, she's like,

1175
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,540
 I'm not drinking that.

1176
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,020
 I'm like, I'm not either, I'm with you.

1177
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,260
 (congregation laughing)

1178
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,620
 And the guy's like, no, just taste it.

1179
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,820
 And I tried it, I was like, oh my gosh, that's amazing.

1180
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,260
 When did you sneak in like a pound of sugar or something?

1181
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,020
 Like, what, it was incredible.

1182
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,320
 Like, all I saw you put in there

1183
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,060
 was stuff that's good for me.

1184
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,940
 And that's, like, you want her to be fun and attractive,

1185
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,180
 but if you go after the things that are good for marriage,

1186
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,320
 the fun and the attractive is gonna come.

1187
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,300
 It might surprise you, but if you go after the fun

1188
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,740
 and attractive and chemistry as the top priority

1189
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,700
 and you leave out those other things,

1190
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,460
 it's gonna mess you up.

1191
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,460
 Your marriage is gonna die before it started.

1192
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,700
 And if you don't believe me, look behind you.

1193
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,960
 Not literally behind you, I mean, like,

1194
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,660
 look at your past dating life and what you valued

1195
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,020
 and how did that work out.

1196
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,860
 Guys, would you just consider if I'm right?

1197
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,340
 Don't even stoop to consider if I'm right.

1198
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,980
 Would you consider if he's right?

1199
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,260
 God loves you, he knows, he wants something from you.

1200
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,540
 I'm not just saying, like, don't just hear me say,

1201
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,180
 hey, suck it up and eat your vegetables.

1202
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,540
 That's not what I'm saying.

1203
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,100
 I'm saying, hey, you start your list with what God values.

1204
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,360
 If you do that, you're gonna be okay.

1205
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,180
 You're gonna be okay, guys, I know you're confused.

1206
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,580
 I know you've believed lies,

1207
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,580
 but guys, if you're well and you wanna get married,

1208
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,940
 I can help you.

1209
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,480
 I'd love to help you, let me pray.

1210
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,620
 Father, thank you for just loving us enough

1211
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,640
 to even care about these little things,

1212
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,940
 who we would partner with.

1213
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,140
 God, as we consider the ingredients

1214
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,240
 that we would seek out,

1215
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,700
 would you just help us in our foolishness

1216
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,340
 to love what you love,

1217
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,940
 to long for what you long for,

1218
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,100
 to seek what you seek out in us,

1219
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,300
 really the things that you create in us, God,

1220
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,940
 by the power of your Holy Spirit.

1221
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,580
 You're the king of hearts.

1222
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,580
 You direct them wherever you please.

1223
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,300
 So Lord, would you be the king of our hearts

1224
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,900
 and would you direct them to someone

1225
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,740
 whose heart you already have

1226
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,580
 and help us to live out your will?

1227
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1228
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
