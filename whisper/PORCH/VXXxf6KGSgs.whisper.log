[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.560]   We are in a series called Before There Were Kings.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.560]   You know what?
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.760]   This is definitely a mistitled series, right?
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.300]   Because here's the problem.
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.800]   There was nothing but kings in the day and age that were about to study.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.240]   We're in a book of the Bible called Judges.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.480]   It's really kind of difficult to get your arms around it.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.600]   Judges were not guys in black robes that made decisions and banging their gavel.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240]   Judges were people that made a decision.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240]   I am sick and tired of what I'm underneath.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.560]   I'm sick and tired of the oppression, of the despair, the anxiety, the loneliness, and
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.480]   I'm going to do something about it because I believe God wants to do something about
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.480]   it.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.760]   I'm not going to be underneath unrighteousness.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.120]   I'm going to undertake courageously what God wants me to do.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.040]   And God always wants to set people free.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.800]   This is a great night to be here because we're going to tell you that until you have a righteous
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.920]   king, the series should actually be titled Before There Was a Righteous King, who loved
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.720]   God and shunned evil, who stamped out wickedness in the land, surrounded himself with wise
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   counselors.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.080]   Before there was a righteous king, everybody was a king.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.840]   There was nothing but kings.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.800]   Let me just show you some verses that show up again and again in the book of Judges.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.200]   In Judges chapter 17, verse 6, you're going to see this.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.740]   In those days, there was no king, singular, in Israel.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.520]   And so everybody acted like they were a king.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.080]   They could do whatever they wanted to whoever they wanted.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.960]   A little bit later in Judges 18, verse 1, in those days, there was no king.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.520]   And so it talks about some horrible things that happened.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.040]   And then the book closes in Judges chapter 21, verse 25, in those days, there was no
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.600]   king and everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.000]   Proverbs 14, 12 says this, "There's a way that seems right to man, but in the end is
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.320]   the way of death."
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.920]   And specifically, I'm going to tell you what was happening.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.960]   Those that were strongest were oppressing those that were weakest.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.120]   Those that were entitled by their strength and position to do whatever they wanted, which
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.820]   is kind of always the way it happens, right?
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.960]   When you saw the rise of communism in Russia, it wasn't because there was no government
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   leader.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.680]   People were never living in a commune.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.000]   People were never living the same.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.400]   There was always a ruling elite that was oppressive to the masses that said, "What we're going
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.880]   to do is make it equal for everybody."
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.680]   Why they didn't live like everybody else lived.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.960]   And that unbiblical form of human relationship oppressed people for generations until finally
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.760]   some people stood up and put their lives at risk and said, "I'm sick of what I'm underneath
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.400]   and we're going to undertake a revolution."
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.800]   And you know God wants to call you to a revolution.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.600]   Specifically, I'm excited about tonight because I'm going to talk about the only female person
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.440]   who stepped up and she stepped up because the guys were just getting along just fine
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.840]   because they were strong enough to oppress women and take advantage of them.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.640]   And it's always women and children that suffer when men don't do what they're supposed to
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   do.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.400]   One of the things that discourages me is that sometimes when you get around people who rightly
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.660]   understand that God made male and female is that women think that they can't be strong.
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.060]   You need to know something.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.180]   This will never be the country.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.140]   This will never be the community.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.140]   This will never be the church that God wants us to be if we don't have strong, godly women.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.040]   You shouldn't worry, gals, that you might come off as too strong.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.060]   You should worry that you're going to be anything less than a godly woman.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.500]   You should worry that somebody is going to tell you that to be something significant,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.420]   you got to be like a man.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.580]   No, you don't.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.100]   And in fact, I'm going to tell you, in a world where there aren't enough men being men, we
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.840]   need more women to be like Deborah.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.240]   And so men, you're about to look at a text tonight which calls you out.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.060]   And it's going to basically say this.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.220]   If you won't stand up against wickedness, then I'll let a girl do it.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.380]   Now you might go, "That offends me, Todd, if I'm a woman."
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.140]   But let me just say this.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.740]   It is not a sign of courageous men when they send their women to war.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.300]   I don't know if you've been looking, but that's increasingly what we've been doing around
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.640]   here and what is happening because women and men are different physically and in so many
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.540]   other ways, we cannot come up with a standardized way in order to test our young recruits to
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.080]   make sure they're fit for battle.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.240]   We can't say you have to do three pull-ups anymore because we're saying, "Hey, men and
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.660]   women can do all these different same things."
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.060]   Now listen, there are plenty of women who can do three pull-ups, right?
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.340]   I think somebody out there might be saying, "Todd, you're saying women aren't strong.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.380]   Let me throw you in a ring with Ronda Rousey circa 2014 and let her arm bar you into submission."
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.760]   Big boy.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   And she could.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   All right?
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.720]   I have no doubt that Ms. Rousey would have me tapping out.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.760]   But what I don't need to do is tap out on what is true.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:54.340]   What we do need to do is help our women understand that you don't need to worry if you're strong
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.860]   because God designed you to be beautiful and strong, not just in his sight, but in everybody's
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.860]   sight.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.760]   You're about to see a model here that you can follow.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.120]   Her name is Deborah.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.720]   The word Deborah, the name Deborah means honeybee.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.620]   She is sweetness to her friends and she is the sting of death to the enemies of God.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.540]   And Deborah is ready and she is surrounded by a bunch of weak, feckless, corrupt, cowardly
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.060]   men.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.100]   Gals, if that is your state when you walk in here and I go, "Where are all the good
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.100]   men?"
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.180]   Let me just tell you, you just worry about being God's gal.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.660]   You make your heart so much like God wants you to be that a man has to run after God
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.460]   in order to find you.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.340]   And when you do that, let me tell you what will happen.
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.780]   When you do that, there's going to be nothing but godly men courting you.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.860]   And you don't want to marry a guy that you put up with something less than what God intends.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.140]   I am a dad.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.620]   I've got six kids.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.900]   I have three girls and three boys.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.980]   And so I thought it might be important to raise them the way God wanted me to raise
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.980]   them.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.300]   It might shock you, but I didn't go when I was raising my three little girls going,
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.220]   "How can I make these three kids awesome fathers?"
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.800]   Never crossed my mind.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.220]   When I was raising my boys, I didn't say, "What can I do to make these men good mothers?"
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.580]   Never crossed my mind.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.740]   I did, however, start out by saying, "Hey, how can I let these three be godly men?
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.380]   How can I let these three be godly women?"
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.800]   I'm just going to give you the first two, and you see if you don't see the first two
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   show up.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.460]   When I sat down, by the way, I will put this out on social media night, the whole thing
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.500]   with five different characteristics, about 40 some odd different verses, little taglines
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.220]   that go with each one.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.060]   And this is the very first thing, ladies, I taught my little girls, and it looks like
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:08:01.020]   somebody taught it to Deborah, and to the glory of God, and to the salvation of Israel.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.020]   Deborah did this.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.420]   I told my little girls, number one, this is your job.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.820]   Your very first job is to seek God first.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.740]   And specifically, this was the tagline that went with it.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.980]   You reject the lie that you need some prince on a white horse to come and kiss you and
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.740]   give you significance.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.180]   You don't need a man.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.900]   You don't need a baby in your belly or a ring on your finger.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.900]   You don't need somebody to validate you.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.940]   You are already beautiful in my sight.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.180]   You are already valuable in God's sight.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.500]   And one day you may choose to unite yourself with a man who has run hard to God and found
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:40.380]   you there, but you reject the lie that anything or anyone other than Jesus Christ and God
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.880]   can satisfy you.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.940]   You are not vulnerable.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.060]   You are not needy.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.740]   You are complete in Christ and lacking in nothing.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.620]   The sufficiency of Jesus is already there for you, and you are not somebody only if
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.860]   a man says, "You're beautiful or I'll make you mine," because God has already said, "You're
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.500]   mine, and I made you woman, and it is glorious."
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.820]   That was the first thing I taught my little girls.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.900]   And because of that, they didn't get tore through by a bunch of guys and their insecurity
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.060]   that were trying to validate their importance by having some girl for a second feel important
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.140]   enough to come underneath their wing where they would exploit them and toy with them
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.060]   until they moved on to somebody that they thought could make them more of a man in some
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.380]   other way.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:31.460]   So far, my first two gals have dated two guys, and they married them, each of them.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.540]   I mean, my first little girl dated one guy and married him.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.940]   Second girl dated one guy and married him.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.100]   All through high school, I'm saying, "Why would you want to go pursue a guy or let a
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.460]   guy pursue you when he has no intention to finish?"
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.780]   So we're not going to start unless we've got a plan, and if our plan isn't to finish, then
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.900]   let's keep moving on and do something valuable.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.720]   Deborah understood that.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.500]   Number one, you seek God.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.460]   He's got everything you need.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.860]   And by the way, if you find a guy who's seeking God, he's going to be doubly good to you because
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.500]   he's going to give you somebody to encourage you the rest of your life.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:11.780]   Little girls, women, godly friends, can I just beg you, if you didn't have a daddy that
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.780]   taught you that, that you don't need a man to validate you, and he will never meet your
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.780]   needs.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.700]   He will use you and leave you unless he's God's man.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.020]   Secondly, I told my little girls, "Your job is to speak faithfully.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.220]   Specifically, you love others with godly wisdom and boldness and kindness as a faithful completer
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.900]   of others."
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.580]   That is what God made you to do.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.040]   You don't ever have to be silent.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.620]   When it says women are to be quiet in church, in the scripture, that same word is used.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.280]   It's a few verses before where it says, "Pray for kings and all those that are in authority
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.700]   so we might live a quiet life."
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.420]   It doesn't mean don't speak.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.140]   It means men are doing what men are supposed to do so the woman don't have to go, "Would
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.340]   you step up and do what you're supposed to do so I can do what I'm supposed to do?"
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.900]   Because that's the way God designed it.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.420]   When you start to have women do what men are supposed to do, it is chaos.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.900]   When you have men start acting like women, it is chaos.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.420]   Yeah, okay.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.140]   It is.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:23.620]   I mean, I got to tell you, friends, God loves you.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.840]   Don't be scared to be strong.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.380]   Be scared that someone's going to tell you you've got to be a man.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:35.020]   Now you watch Deborah because she does these two things and she does it well.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.460]   I'm going to read you just Judges 4.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.300]   Deborah's story is told historically in Judges chapter 4.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.120]   And then in chapter 5, she just sings a song.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.880]   And so we'll just read Judges 4.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   But here we go.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.660]   It says, "Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord."
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.940]   I'm going to come back to that, but I'm going to read through and then we're going to teach
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.500]   you some truth right here.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:07.140]   "And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin, the king of Cana, who reigned in Hazor.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:12.400]   And the commander of his army was a guy named Sisera, who lived in Herosheth Haoyim.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.220]   The sons of Israel cried to the Lord, for this guy, Sisera, who was just a mercenary
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.220]   and a warmonger, had 900 iron chariots.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:27.460]   And he oppressed the sons of Israel severely for 20 years."
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.180]   And nobody was really that bothered by the fact they were underneath wickedness, except
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.740]   Deborah the Bee.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.820]   It says right here, "Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappadoth, who was a lapdog to
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.620]   evil," we'll get there, "was judging Israel at the time.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.020]   She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.020]   of Ephraim.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.120]   And the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.700]   As she sat and summoned Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kadesh Naphtali, and said to
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.460]   him, 'Behold, the Lord, the God of Israel, has commanded, go and march to Mount Tabor
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.780]   and take with you 10,000 men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun.'"
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.700]   Now let me just tell you something.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.600]   What I could do right now is take out a map and show you these places.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.860]   This is not Greek mythology.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.320]   This is not Hindu mythology.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.420]   This is not the Quran that is just beautiful poetic writings.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.780]   This is what's called historical narrative.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.780]   This happened.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.340]   I have stood in these places.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.500]   I was just a couple of weeks ago at Mount Tabor.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.340]   A little bit ago, I was right where Deborah and Sisera and Barak went to war together.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.060]   This is historical narrative, and what you're seeing is God is at work revealing who he
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.600]   is through a group of people that the whole world may know who he is because he loves
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.140]   people and doesn't want them to be underneath wickedness, so he's revealing himself and
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.640]   showing who he is so folks could run to him, and you're going to have that choice and that
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.580]   opportunity tonight.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.600]   These are real places, 20 miles apart, 30 miles apart, and these are real people in
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.940]   history, and nobody debates this.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:09.340]   It says that what she did is that she had summoned this guy to come, verse 7.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.140]   "I'm going to draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army."
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.200]   By the way, Jabin's not a name.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.240]   It's a title, kind of like pharaoh.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.640]   There's a number of different pharaohs.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:24.280]   There's a number of different Canaanite kings that would go by the name of Jabin, or Jabin.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.880]   She said, "I'm going to give you the king of Canaanite's army with his chariots and
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.880]   his many troops.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.320]   I'm going to draw them out to the river Kishan, and I will give him into your hand."
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.600]   Barak said, "If you'll go with me, mommy, and I can rub your little skirt when we go
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.680]   to war, I will go with you, but if you're not going to go, I'm not going to go."
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   That's what he said.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.780]   It's kind of there in the Hebrew.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.100]   Verse 9, she said, "I will surely go with you.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.380]   Nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours."
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.260]   Now watch this, all right?
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.420]   "But the journey you're about to take, for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hands of
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.420]   a woman."
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:09.380]   This mighty charioteer, this leader of this wicked, marauding, oppressing force, a woman
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.140]   will take him out.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.140]   It's not Ronda Rousey.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.620]   It's going to be some Bedouin old goat.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:23.620]   Literally, that's what she is, a Bedouin woman, an old ... Her name means mountain goat.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.620]   You're about to meet her.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.620]   It's an old goat.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:31.100]   He's going to wipe out the great warrior.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.700]   So Barak called Zebulon and Naphtali together to Kadesh, and 10,000 men went up with him.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.900]   Deborah also went up with him.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.700]   Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab,
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.780]   the father-in-law of Moses.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.500]   So what we're going to see here is that there's an old tribe of people, non-Jews, that lived
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.740]   and kind of were around Israel.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.780]   They used to be God-fearing non-Jews, but these folks had broke off a little bit and
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.420]   had adopted now back some of the wicked ways of the Canaanites.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:02.540]   And it says here that this guy had pitched his tent far away as the oak in Zaninim, which
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.860]   is near Kadesh, which is just, if you care, it's right there by the bayou.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.100]   It's at the bottom of the Sea of Galilee today.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:15.020]   Then they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.660]   And so Sisera called together all his chariots, 900 iron chariots, and all the people who
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.620]   were with him from Heresheth Hagoyim to the River Kashan, which runs right through a valley
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.940]   of Jezreel, also called the Valley of Megiddo, home one day to a battle called the Battle
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.420]   of Armageddon.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:36.380]   It is the only big, wide, broad valley in all of mountainous Israel.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.260]   It's where battles have always been fought, and there will be another one there one day.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.260]   But watch this.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.060]   "Deborah said to Barak, 'Arise, for this is the day in which the Lord has given Sisera
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.060]   into your hands.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.420]   Behold, the Lord has gone out before you.'
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.980]   So Barak went down from Mount Tabor," which is right across that valley from where they
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.820]   were, "with 10,000 men following him.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.140]   And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.140]   before Barak.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.300]   And Sisera alighted from his chariot," which means got off, "and fled away on foot."
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.620]   I'm going to tell you why he ran from his chariot in a moment.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.460]   "But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Herosheth HaGoyim."
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.900]   He came back from whence he came.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.700]   "And all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.100]   Not even one was left.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.220]   Now Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Yael, the wife of Heber the Kenite.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.700]   For there was peace between Yabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.300]   But there was no peace between this woman, because she knew the wickedness of men.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.500]   And she also knew that what men did after wars, they would take spoil."
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.180]   You'll find in Judges 5 that Sisera's mama is sitting there going, "I wonder where my
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.180]   boy is.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.740]   Why hasn't he come home from war with all his chariots?
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.500]   Where's the thunder of the horses that would come right here?"
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.740]   And they basically said, "Well, who knows?
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.420]   He's probably with one, two of his concubines having his way with the spoils of war."
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:56.580]   And you can find that Yael had had about enough of that.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.780]   And so she says, "Come on in, Sisera."
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.300]   She didn't know what he was running from.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.740]   She just said, "Turn aside, my master.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.740]   Turn aside to me.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.740]   Don't be afraid."
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.460]   And he turned aside to her tent, and she covered him with a rug.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.220]   He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty."
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.420]   So she opened a bottle of milk and gave him a drink, and she covered him.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.620]   And we're going to stop right there, not to ruin the story.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.620]   Are you ready?
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.620]   Let me teach you something.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.340]   You come in here, you go, "Hey, man, I'm giving up my Tuesday night to come here.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.180]   I'm tuning in a podcast, and you give me all this ancient history.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.660]   What relevance does this have with me?"
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.660]   Listen, I've already given you some about what'll happen if you just let God be who
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.740]   God intends to be in your life.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.100]   There is one hero in this story.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.300]   It's God.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:43.380]   And there's only one person that trusts the hero, and she is ready, because she doesn't
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.200]   need ... If there's no man who will do what a man will do, God will do it for her.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.940]   And she seeks first his kingdom and his righteousness, and you're about to see everything is added
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.300]   to her.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:19:00.040]   She has not bought the lie that she needs anything other than God in her life.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.440]   And when you get one person who will do that, male or female, you're about to see blessing
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.940]   unfold.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.140]   So let's learn from this.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.860]   So this is important right here, because you're going to be studying this book.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.020]   And again, remember, the key to this book is that there was nothing but kings.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.380]   Everybody thought they could make up their own right and wrong.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.060]   We talked last week about how lies pervade themselves throughout culture, and there is
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.020]   a lie in our culture today which says there is no absolute truth.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.980]   There's a lie which says, "If it feels good, do it.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.540]   If it seems right to you, it must be all right."
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.960]   That is always going to lead to chaos.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.380]   And let me tell you something.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.760]   Wickedness loves chaos, because the only way that people put up with tyrants and losses
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.940]   of freedom is when there's so much chaos, they go, "You know what?
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.740]   I'd rather live under a wicked tyrant than to have this much chaos."
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.260]   But there is an alternative.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.820]   You call people to live in a way where they don't need a tyrant to rule over them, because
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.020]   they've dealt with a tyrant of sin in their heart.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.100]   And if we don't quickly do that, individually and corporately as a nation, you will see
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:08.620]   more and more and more and more freedoms be taken from you.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:13.340]   And what will eventually happen is they'll say, "We've got to take all your guns, because
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.700]   you guys kill each other with your guns all the time."
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.260]   And guess who takes them?
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.660]   Men who are part of the wickedness.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:26.180]   And what do you think what happens when some men get all the chariots, and then they continue
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.140]   in their wickedness towards you?
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.020]   You go, "We've got a problem here, because it's not easy now to discuss with them whether
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.800]   or not we like their kind of wickedness.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.340]   And we don't have any more chariots or any more guns."
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.860]   That's why our founders said, "Listen, we're going to let people have guns."
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:51.060]   That's why also our founders said, "Our constitution is wholly unfit to lead an immoral and unredeemed
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.060]   people."
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.300]   And if there is anything increasing in our land today, you guys are seeing it.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.660]   We have no longer...
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.500]   We quit doing moral formation.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:06.660]   We quit preaching virtue and honor in schools.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:16.620]   We mock at courage and valor, and then we're shocked to find chaos in our midst.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.980]   And what we'll do is some people say, "What you need is let us take your guns.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.020]   What you need is let us take away your freedom.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.220]   We'll show you peace while they prosper, and you're in bondage."
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.420]   That's what was going on.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.580]   In a very different way, they got here.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:34.420]   But when you don't love God, you love necessarily something less than God.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.020]   When you don't love what is holy, you love necessarily something that is unholy, and
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.300]   it will not work out for you.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.940]   Now what is going to happen right here is this is the third cycle that has happened.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.220]   I'll just make a little note for you.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:51.820]   The first one happened, and a guy named Othniel steps up, and they had been, if you will,
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.260]   oppressed for eight years.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.340]   And then they were oppressed for 18 years because they repeated the same cycle, and
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.060]   a guy named Ehud spoke up, but that was 18 years.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.740]   And now, 20 years.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.380]   Do you see what's happening here?
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.620]   Judgment gets harder.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.780]   It gets longer.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.820]   It gets closer together.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.920]   This is the cycle that you see.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:17.020]   We put this slide up last week, and you'll see what happens is that there was some sense
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.860]   of salvation and goodness in the land, and what happens when things are going well, we
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.860]   don't think we need God.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.020]   We think we can just do what we want to do, and we leave God.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.300]   We go our own way.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.340]   That's called sin.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.100]   And when we operate in a way that seems right to us, it leads to death, not to life, which
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.260]   puts us in bondage, which makes us go, "I don't like being in bondage."
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.580]   And then God, in His grace, is going to rescue us.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.100]   This happens seven times in this book.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.640]   Now watch this.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.260]   Seven times the people are in bondage, and seven times in this book they're delivered.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:53.460]   I'm going to read you key verses in the book of Judges, and you, in your brilliance as
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:59.420]   biblical scholars, will see the thing that happens that causes deliverance to people
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.260]   every time.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.000]   It's what your generation needs.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.120]   It's what I've been trying to do as a leader in this country, in this generation.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   Watch this.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:18.900]   We'll start in Judges chapter 3, verse 10, and it says this.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.340]   It says, "The Spirit of the Lord came upon him."
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.380]   It says, "Othniel," the first judge, the first deliverer.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.740]   And it says, "And he judged Israel wasn't doing right.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:35.300]   We're going to help it do right, and we're going to wage war against wickedness."
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.900]   And so the Lord, it says, says he wiped out this king of Mesopotamia who had been the
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.240]   oppressing force.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   Watch this.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.600]   I'm going to skip over Deborah, because it says it differently for her.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.900]   In Judges chapter 6, verse 34, it says this.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:55.680]   It says, "So the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet."
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.380]   And it says, "All the Abizarites were called together to follow him."
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.960]   Look at Judges 11, okay?
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   Here's another deliverer.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.340]   It says, "Jephthah."
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.700]   "Now the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah."
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.700]   You go to Judges 13.
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.700]   There's a guy named Samson.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.980]   "And the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him."
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.660]   You see the same thing in Judges 14, verse 6, and verse 19.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.460]   And then you'll see it again in 15.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.640]   That is the phrase that showed up every time God was going to move people out of wickedness
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.000]   and into a place of prosperity.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.080]   The Spirit of the Lord came upon.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:40.880]   And let me just take this outside of the context of a nation, because you, who are trying to
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.480]   go your own way, who are trying to figure it out, maybe you weren't raised by a righteous
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   Deborah, you weren't raised by a righteous daddy.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.920]   And so you've been basically trying to make your way, listen to the world, listen to others,
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.120]   you're your own king, you're your own queen, doing everything you could.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   But here's the truth.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.520]   You know you're under oppression.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.960]   You've tried to find guys that would validate you, and they've oppressed you and used you
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.280]   and left you out there.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.380]   You wonder if anybody could ever love you again.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.920]   You're a guy that maybe has had some success, but you realize that success is fleeting and
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.360]   it's not successful enough.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.600]   And you're living under the wickedness of trying to validate yourself the way the world
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.160]   says you should validate yourself.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.680]   And you're going to continue to suffer and be under wickedness and oppression until this
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.320]   happens to you.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.120]   Until there is a righteous king in your life.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   Mark my word.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.240]   God's not trying to rip you off, he's trying to set you free.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.480]   He's trying to make you the kind of self-leader, self-king that doesn't lead to self-destruction.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:45.240]   The scripture says again and again, when the wicked rule, that the people groan.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   And here's the truth.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.920]   You know that.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.320]   You know that because wickedness has been ruling in a lot of your hearts, and you're
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.960]   like, "I am sick and tired of this being over me."
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.000]   And guess what you need?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.680]   The same thing the nation needs when wickedness is ruling over it.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.440]   You need the spirit of the Lord to come upon you.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.760]   And you need to start to see that God is not somebody to be managed or avoided.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.960]   That God's not somebody to be appeased and bought off and paid tax to by doing religious
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   things.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.840]   You need to realize that God is good, his word is true, and that disobeying him doesn't
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:18.040]   hurt him other than he loves you.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:25.020]   And I got to tell you, you know, one of the things that happened to me is that I was given
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.500]   the privilege of bringing life into this world.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.600]   And I got to tell you as a dad, nothing broke my heart more when I understood things that
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.680]   they couldn't understand in their little three-year-old, 13-year-old self.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.760]   And I had to ask them to trust me, and they wouldn't sometimes trust me, and they'd throw
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.020]   fits.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.560]   Or they would get even more freedom when they're a little older, and they'd want to go their
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.360]   own way because all I wanted was for blessing to come into their life.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.200]   And every single time I would watch my kids go, "I don't know if I'm going to trust you."
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.920]   I go, "I kind of get it because I'm not perfect, and I've made some mistakes, and you've seen
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.400]   me act selfishly."
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.560]   But every time I would watch them have a hard time trusting me, God would just say, "Hey,
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:09.640]   Todd, I haven't made mistakes, and I don't ever do anything out of selfishness.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.360]   And man, I love you, and it breaks my heart every time you don't trust me, and you let
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.120]   wickedness reign over you.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   And the one who comes to steal, kill, and destroy be your father.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.560]   He's the father of lies, and I hate it when my kid believes lies.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:30.040]   And I love you, and I want to make a way back for you to me."
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.040]   This is the book of Judges.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   It just keeps happening.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.800]   And the Lord is trying to raise up individuals who will stop doing evil again in the sight
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   of the Lord, not because it hurts God, other than that God loves you.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.240]   And so the Lord sold them into the hand.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   That's what God does.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.680]   He loves you enough to let you have the consequences of your actions.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.760]   Don't be deceived.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   God is not mocked.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   A man will reap what he sows.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   This is just a fact.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.080]   Some of you go, "Well, Todd, I've been kind of doing wicked things for a while, and it
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   really isn't that bad."
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.760]   Well, the Bible really will address you in that.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.000]   There's a thing called the law of the harvest.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.520]   This is the law of the harvest.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.680]   The law of the harvest is you reap what you sow.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.920]   In other words, what you put in, you're going to get out.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.320]   But here's the thing about the harvest, is when you put seeds in, you don't reap that
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.120]   right away.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:22.120]   The law of the harvest is you reap what you sow, you reap it later than you sow it.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.920]   And you also reap more than you sow, because you put an apple seed in the ground, what
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   do you get?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   One apple?
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.360]   No, man, you get a whole tree.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.600]   You reap what you sow, you reap it later than you sow, and you reap more than you sow.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   And it's just that old statement.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.000]   I think we said it again last week.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.280]   Sin will take you farther than you want to go, keep you longer than you want to stay,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.820]   and cost you more than you want to pay.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.840]   And you'll sit there one day and go, "How did I get here?"
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.040]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.200]   Proverbs 19.2 says this, "It's not good for a man to be without knowledge.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.840]   He who makes haste with his feet errs, gets on his chariot and rides towards wickedness."
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:01.000]   It says, "The foolishness of man," Proverbs 19.3, "The foolishness now of man subverts
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.480]   his way or ruins his way, and then his heart rages against God."
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   Have you ever done that?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   Have you ever been in your chariot, not listening to God, not following the Spirit of the Lord,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.200]   doing what you want to do, and you're in this cycle again of pain, and you go, "God, how
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.240]   could you let this keep happening to me?"
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.360]   And he's like, "I didn't want it to happen to you, but I'm not going to rape you.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.720]   I'm not going to make you do something.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.840]   If that's the way you want to run, I'll stand there and weep, and my toes will be at the
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.400]   edge of the ranch, ready to run to you when you turn back to me."
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.960]   And when you've had enough of wickedness, this is Ecclesiastes 8, verse 11, "Because
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.840]   the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly," in other words, because you don't
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.880]   reap immediately what you sow.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.200]   Ecclesiastes 8, 11 says this.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:49.480]   It says, "Therefore, the hearts of men among them are given fully to do evil."
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.320]   Have you ever gotten more emboldened by that?
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   Right?
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.960]   You ever cheated on a test, got away with it, and go, "Well, I think I'll study even
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.000]   less next time."
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.840]   You don't do it once and go, "Okay, I got away with that.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   I prospered.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   It was excellent.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.800]   Let's never do that again."
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   You don't do that.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:14.480]   You wait until it stings, and I'm just going to tell you, God loves you, and so He lets
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.120]   you experience what you choose so that you can just see that's not something you want
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   to keep choosing.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.360]   Some of you guys have gotten to a really dark place, and you know what I'm talking about
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.920]   when I say that judgment always gets harder and longer and closer together.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:41.400]   Proverbs 29, 1, it says, "He who hardens his neck after much reproof will suddenly be broken
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.080]   beyond remedy."
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.640]   This is the progression of sin.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.560]   First it startles us, like, "Wow, that was pretty."
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:56.680]   Then it becomes pleasing to us, then easy, then delightful, then frequent, then habitual,
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.460]   then a way of life, and then our guilt is gone.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.600]   We feel dead to the world.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   Then we're obstinate.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.920]   "There's nothing wrong with this.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:09.080]   You're never going to tell me to stop doing this."
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.240]   Then we live in the despair and sadness of damnation of our own choosing.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.600]   It's the way it always goes.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.880]   I just want to say to some of you guys that are here, and you walked in with some scars,
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   be thankful for those scars.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   Be thankful for the pain, for the despair, for the anxiety, for the bitterness, for the
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.840]   hangovers, for the DUIs, for the STDs, for the unwanted pregnancies, for the loneliness.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:40.360]   Be thankful for it, but turn from that vomit.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.400]   Don't eat any more of it.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.520]   Your father loves you, and he can restore the years the locusts have eaten.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.240]   You need to know something.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.200]   I don't care where you've been or what you've done.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.080]   Who you are is somebody that God can use.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.720]   Can I say that to you again?
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.080]   I don't care who you are or where you've been.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:11.480]   What you are is somebody that God wants to forgive and heal and restore and use.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.920]   Here's what's so amazing.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   This room is full of people like this.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:26.320]   It is full of people who used to be just professional vomit eaters who just go, "What am I doing?
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.080]   God, this isn't your fault."
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.160]   The kindness of God in the form of the Spirit of the Lord fell upon them when they repented
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.080]   and acknowledged the wickedness of their own queenship, their own kingship.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.520]   God lifted their head and forgave them, and he made them beautiful.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:52.080]   They are now Deborahs, and they are Daniels, and they are helping others out of wickedness.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.040]   You can be next.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.920]   It says the sons of Israel cried to the Lord.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.560]   I just don't want to rush past this.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.800]   They cried to the Lord.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.340]   That's all you have to do.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:13.680]   Some of you guys like Israel in this section have for 20 years lived underneath wickedness,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.560]   and you're just like, "Todd, I don't know what to do."
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.480]   I just want to say, "Well, why don't you cry out to the Lord because he is gracious."
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.760]   Can I just read to you what a guy who actually had a pretty good 20-year run, and then he
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.400]   tubed it, what he did?
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.620]   He did exactly what you did.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.580]   He was eating not at vomit.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.440]   He was eating at king's tables, and then he just couldn't resist people who tried to convince
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.040]   him that vomit is where life was.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   His name is David.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.720]   This is what David said.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   This is Psalm 32.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:53.880]   He says, "How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is covered."
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.880]   Psalm 32.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.160]   David is saying, "You want to know who's blessed?
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   You want to know who's happy?
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.320]   It's the man to whom the Lord doesn't impute iniquity, doesn't give him what he deserves,
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.160]   and whose spirit there is no deceit."
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.800]   In other words, not that he's not just a liar, but his spirit isn't lying to him.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.480]   Listen, your spirit's lying to you.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.760]   If you think there's something in this world that's going to make your spirit happy, it's
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   just not.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   David said, "When I kept silent about my wickedness and my sin, my body wasted away through my
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.000]   groaning all day long."
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Because David was a righteous king, made an unrighteous decision, and tried to hide it,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   and it just didn't work.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.920]   There's only one way to get that out, and it's got to purge, and then you've got to
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.560]   not go eat it again.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.960]   "Through my groaning all day long, day and night, your hand, God, was heavy upon me."
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   You felt that?
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   It's called anxiety.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.960]   It's called depression.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.960]   It's called loneliness.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.640]   It's called hopelessness.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.880]   Is it inside of you?
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.440]   "My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer."
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:57.520]   You see that Hebrew word there, which just means rest, just musical interlude, and just
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.000]   this is who he was.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.280]   And then he says, "But I acknowledge my sin to you.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.400]   It is judges," chapter 4, verse 3.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.480]   "I cried out to the Lord.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   In my iniquity I didn't hide.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.760]   I told you this is what's inside of me.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   It's got to come out.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.200]   I'm going to confess what I've done to the Lord."
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   He already knows it.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.800]   He just wants to know that I know it, and so I'm going to say, "Lord, this isn't good."
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.320]   And God forgave the guilt of my sin.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.640]   Can I just say this to you?
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.160]   If you got that thing in you this morning, I mean this evening, I would just beg you,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.360]   just get it out.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.160]   God knows it's there.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.240]   It's just not going to get better.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.680]   It's not going to pass.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   You just got to go, "This is what I have eaten, and it's got to come out."
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   Verse 6, this is for you.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.480]   Chapter 4, this is what I would have said if I was with Israel during the time of Judges,
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.480]   chapter 4.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:51.600]   I would have said, "Israel, let everyone who is godly pray in a time when you may be found,
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.000]   because surely in a flood of great waters, there's a day the one who hardens his neck
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.520]   after much reproof suddenly will be broken beyond remedy."
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.280]   That's not you today.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   That's not you.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.160]   I can say that with confidence because you're still here and alive to listen to this.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.600]   It's appointed for men to die once, and after this comes judgment.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.200]   It is possible that your heart can become so hard that you'll never turn, but my God
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.520]   says, "Todd, you never assume you meet somebody like that, so I'm not going to assume it tonight."
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.360]   You just right now in your seat just go, "Lord, help me listen to this guy as he keeps talking.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.120]   Help pick the lock of my hard heart.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.720]   Help me believe that you can restore the wickedness that I've lived under."
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.880]   Just watch him go to work.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.480]   Let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when he may be found.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.400]   Surely in a flood of great waters, they will not reach him.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.640]   God, you're my hiding place.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.800]   You preserve me from trouble.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.040]   You surround me with songs of deliverance.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.880]   Let me just rest in that truth.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.720]   That's what God wants you to know.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.400]   I'm going to just say one more thing about this, and then we're going to tie in because
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.440]   remember this book, you're going to see it seven times.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.600]   Seven times they go through this cycle.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   It's symbolic.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.560]   It's a picture of this is just perfect evil.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   You keep going.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.360]   Some of you guys, what's happened is you have purged the wickedness before because you got
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.360]   the DUI.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.160]   You had the unwanted pregnancy.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.420]   You had the STD.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.680]   You had a boyfriend that broke your heart.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.120]   You swear you'd never go back to that broken cistern again, and yet you do because what
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.680]   you experienced was a sorrow like the world experiences and not a godly sorrow.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.960]   You're like, "What are you even talking about?
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.060]   This is what I'm talking about.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.060]   This is your scripture.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.600]   This is God talking to you.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.200]   This is 2 Corinthians 7, verse 10, and this is what you've got to be.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:38.700]   The sorrow that is according to the will of God is the sorrow that produces repentance,
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.700]   which is a word that says change of mind, not just a sadness.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.940]   What you're going to see in the book of Judges, I want you to watch this.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.940]   This is why I'm teaching you this because in the book of Judges, you're going to see
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.540]   them go through that cycle of things are good.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.900]   I don't think I need God.
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:54.900]   Things aren't good.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.900]   God help me.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.900]   Things are good.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.020]   Have you ever done that?
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.020]   Let's just be honest for a second.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.020]   Oh, God.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:10.340]   Don't let this blow what it's going to blow.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.340]   You got away with it.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.340]   You're like, "Okay.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.340]   Oh, God.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.340]   Don't let this thing have two lines.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.340]   Oh, I got away with it.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.340]   Oh, God, let this feeling go away.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.340]   I don't know if I can live without it, but let it go away.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   I won't do it again."
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:35.140]   You're sorry for the way you feel and for the oppression that you're experiencing, but
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.060]   you're not sorry that you have no king that is righteous.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.860]   You're not sorry enough to stop ruling your own life.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.580]   You want to just keep going back to that.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:52.140]   That's what this book is about, but praise God, there was somebody that the spirit of
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.220]   the Lord came upon, and I pray you find it tonight.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.540]   Some of you cried to the Lord because there was this guy, he had 900 chariots.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.900]   Chariots weren't like tanks.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.740]   Chariots were basically this.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.340]   When armies would come and they'd start fighting, there would always be a time when there'd
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.620]   be kind of a give and take, and they would start to maybe withdraw and run away.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.680]   If the other side had chariots, they could track you down and wipe you out.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:18.000]   Those 900 chariots that were running all around Israel that the Canaanites had because they
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.120]   had understood how to craft things out of iron had kept Israel from saying, "We don't
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   like your wickedness."
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.240]   Now, Israel had its own brand of wickedness.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.640]   Just mark my word, guys.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:40.440]   The Democratic Party, the Republican Party, it's got its own brand of wickedness.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:47.160]   Will you get leaders that are going to rule, not as Democrats or Republicans, but being
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.700]   ruled by a loving God, and especially if they start to take away your right to raise your
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:59.940]   voice and to assemble and, if necessary, wage war against wickedness, then you better get
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.720]   ready for King George to rule over you.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.880]   You're not going to like it.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.340]   What they're going to try and do is group you up into little classes and say, "Okay,
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.040]   you women, okay, you people who want to express yourself this way, okay, you people who want
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.760]   to express yourself this way, okay, you people who have been hurt before, we'll put you in
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.480]   a whole bunch of little identity politics, and then we're going to tell each of you,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.240]   we'll give you what you want, and we'll collaborate you all together and get power from you, and
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.440]   then I'll be in power.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.360]   That's all I really want anyway," because that's what unrighteous, wicked men always
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   do.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.320]   They'll tell you they've got your best interest in mind, but just watch the healthcare they
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.400]   vote for themselves and the healthcare they give you.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.220]   Watch the benefits they vote for themselves and the benefits they give you.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.660]   Watch the guards they put out in front of their house and the guards they say you don't
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:45.360]   need in front of yours.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.840]   What had happened is that the Israelites had no way in their own wickedness to go, "That's
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:58.080]   more wicked," but there was a prophetess.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.760]   Praise God.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   There was no men.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.760]   Men were cowards.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.920]   Men were wounding and exploiting one another and exploiting women, but there was a prophetess.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:11.200]   Praise God.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.400]   The wife of Lippadoth, his name means torch or lamp, but the lamp was out.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.580]   This brother wasn't teaching people the word of God.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:25.000]   He was too busy living his wicked life, but she was judging Israel at the time.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Now watch this.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   This is beautiful.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.640]   She used to sit under the palm tree, a place of rest, of fruitfulness, of refreshing, of
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.440]   shade, of sweetness in a season of bitterness.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.480]   That's Deborah.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.720]   That's anybody who is ... Have you ever met someone?
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.040]   Do you guys know Deborah?
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.040]   Don't you know somebody?
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.400]   Man, when I'm around that girlfriend, that girl, she's refreshing.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.920]   She's an oasis in this despairing life.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.880]   There's just something about her and that something is the spirit of the Lord.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.800]   Men in their brokenness, people in their brokenness had nowhere else to go and so they would go
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.280]   to her for judgment.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.800]   Like, "Will you tell us what you think?"
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.160]   He knew what Deborah would do.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.920]   That's what prophets do.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.320]   Prophets either tell you what God's going to do or prophets tell you what God has already
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.840]   said needs to be done.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.060]   There are forth tellers.
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.600]   They bring forth what is there or they say, "Hey, this is what's going to come."
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.880]   Very rarely does God do that second one.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.640]   He says, "If you want to find people who can tell you things are going to happen," and
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.840]   they call themselves prophets.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   That's awesome.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.720]   They don't just speak though in vague generalities.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.600]   They're not Christian fortune cookies.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.440]   They're very specific.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:46.960]   He says if they get one wrong, you got yourself a bad prophet.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   But what your Deborahs should do is they should open the Word of God and say, "This is true.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.520]   Let me bring it forward to you."
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:03.200]   It should be life-giving, fruit-bearing, an oasis in your desert.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:09.080]   And so she didn't have the general sitting at her feet, so she summoned him.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.760]   She said, "Boy, why don't you come down here?"
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.760]   In verse 6.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.800]   So she sent and summoned Barak.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.720]   His name means lightning.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.360]   This brother's flashing around doing anything but what he should be doing.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.920]   This knucklehead wasn't sitting at the feet of wisdom, and he didn't have wisdom himself.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:34.960]   But praise God, this courageous woman who does what godly women do, which is speak faithfully.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:41.080]   She couldn't be quiet in church because the men weren't speaking the truth.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.320]   She'd been praying for kings and those who were in authority, and they weren't godly
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.920]   people, and she wasn't going to live a quiet and tranquil life, so she just stepped up
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.880]   and said, "We're going to fix this.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.840]   Boy, you're the general.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   Come here.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   Let me tell you what God's going to do.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.200]   He's going to use your faithless self if you'll just listen to me."
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:04.240]   And there was something about Deborah that made this boy listen.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:10.800]   She sent and summoned him and said, "Has not the Lord" — that's really what it means
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   when it says "behold."
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   Some of your Bibles might even say that.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:18.200]   "Has not the God of Israel commanded, 'Don't put up with this wickedness, this godlessness,
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.520]   this Canaanite way?
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.840]   You don't have to live that way in Dallas, in Houston.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.680]   You don't have to live that way in Missouri.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.480]   You can live as people who've been set free from the fleshly lusts which wage war against
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.560]   your soul.'"
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:39.400]   Somebody in this generation has got to say, "We don't have to listen to their progressive
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.400]   ideology.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.200]   We're going to go back to the ancient past where the good way is, and we're going to
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.880]   walk in it, and we are going to flourish, and we're going to set up palm trees all
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:55.160]   across this country, and we're going to tell people to come and find rest."
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.280]   Surrender to God.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.400]   We're going to change the world through the lives of young adults.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.040]   But we need young adults who are doing this.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.720]   She says, "Barrick, man up.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.800]   God doesn't like wickedness and oppression.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.920]   Thus says the Lord, 'Go.'"
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.960]   And he says, "I'm going to draw out Sisera."
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.960]   God says this.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.360]   "I'm going to bring Sisera to you, the commander of Jemez's army with his chariots and his
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.000]   many troops, and I'm going to bring him down to the Megiddo Valley that the River
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.520]   Kishan runs through it."
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.240]   Now what we know happened historically is that what God did is he turned on the rain.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.760]   Now let me ask you a question.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.160]   This is a big field.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.120]   It's in a paved highway.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:42.880]   When do chariots become unhelpful?
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   In mud.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.800]   God says, "I'm going to draw them out.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:55.280]   I'm going to turn on my sprinkler system, and we're going to clean this place up."
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.800]   And so Barrick just says, "Will you go with me?
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:04.320]   I don't trust God, but you seem to."
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:09.460]   And she just says, "I'll go, but the honor's not going to be yours because there's never
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:15.440]   honor when you don't do your job."
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.000]   So she rose and went, gathered.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.040]   Deborah went with them.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   We know the story.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.140]   Sisera, in verse 13, called together the chariots.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.680]   We read it, 900 of them, and all the people who were with them, and they came down in
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   the River Kishan.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:33.680]   We know from chapter 5 it overflowed with lightning and with storms, and the river overflowed
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.960]   and flooded that valley like it still does today, and those men didn't know how to fight
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.840]   off their chariots, and it was a game changer.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:47.080]   And they ran 15 miles back home, and Barrick and the boys chased them, and then Sisera,
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.280]   everybody was dead, but Sisera was still alive.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:58.040]   So Sisera runs about 40, 50 miles back up by the Sea of Galilee, and here comes this
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:03.480]   old mountain goat that's sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   And her husband was buddies with him, but she wasn't buddies with him because she knew
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.160]   what wicked men did.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.880]   And so Jael went to meet him, verse 18, and said, "Turn aside, my master.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   Turn aside to me.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   Don't be afraid."
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.880]   And he turned aside, drew her in her tent, and she covered him with a rug, and he said,
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.880]   "Please give me a little water to drink, for I'm thirsty."
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.400]   So she opened a bottle of milk.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.680]   When do you drink milk?
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.400]   Whenever you open a bag of Oreos.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.960]   That's when you drink milk.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.800]   When you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, that's when you drink milk.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.440]   And apparently, late at night, to make you sleepy.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   Right?
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   Isn't it interesting?
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   Watch this.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   Deborah's a bee.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   What do bees make?
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.440]   What do goats give you?
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.440]   Milk.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.360]   Israel's the land of milk and honey.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.960]   And when you start to let milk and honey, and you believe in God, you watch peace come
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   to the land.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.560]   This is just beautiful what God did right here.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.000]   He gave her a little milk, and he said, "You go stay in the doorway of the tent.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.640]   Tell you what to do."
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:06.120]   The mountain goat took a tent peg and seized a hammer in her hand and went secretly to
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.480]   him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground, for he was
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.480]   sound asleep.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.960]   And I love this.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.420]   The Bible makes an observation.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.920]   So he died.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:23.560]   I guess so, when a mountain goat drives a peg through your ear.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.440]   Here's a picture of it, a painting of it, that's been captured a number of times.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.760]   Look at that little mountain goat.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.240]   She looks like a mountain goat, doesn't she?
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.800]   Right there.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:41.440]   That little midget woman, a Bedouin, a gypsy.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.440]   Let me just tell you something, man.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.400]   When God's ready to get rid of wickedness, he'll get rid of wickedness, and he doesn't
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.600]   need your help.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.120]   But he's willing to use you if you just say, "Lord, here I am.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.080]   Use me."
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   So here comes Barak.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.080]   He's all excited.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   He's going to get his kill, right?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.080]   I just love this.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:02.880]   And it says in verse 22, it says, "And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.520]   meet him and said, 'Come, I'll show you coward, the man you're looking for.'
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:13.080]   I nailed his head to the ground.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.840]   And behold, Sisera was lying dead with a dead peg in his temple."
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.160]   That's awful that I just laughed at that right there.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.840]   But let me just tell you, that's biblical.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:28.160]   When the wicked reign, people groan.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.240]   But when righteousness comes, the people rejoice.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:37.080]   Wouldn't you laugh and rejoice if I came into your life and said, "I'm going to take that
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.080]   thing that's oppressing you, and I'm going to take my little mountain goat courage of
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.520]   self, and I'm going to drive a nail through its head, and we're going to look at it.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   It can't go nowhere.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.080]   It's dead, and it's stapled to the ground."
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:51.520]   You'd be like, "You can do that?
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   See the Wizard of Oz.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   Watch what happens when all the munchkins see the red shoes and the striped socks with
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   a house on top of it.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:09.080]   They all go, 'Ding dong, ding ding dandy dong, the witch is dead.'"
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   That is so biblical.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   It is, thank you.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:25.760]   I just want to tell you, God is just waiting for you to say, "Spirit of God, fall on me.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.040]   Kill the wickedness through the cross of Jesus Christ and the compassion and the love.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.120]   You're not mad at me.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.680]   I've been a witch.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.040]   Heal me.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.600]   Forgive me.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:40.960]   Help me not be a vomit giver and eater, and make me somebody who sits under a palm tree."
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:48.640]   And gives rest and whose life is restored, and who is honey and sweetness to the land.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   I'll give you four quick points.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   I'll do this in five minutes.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.640]   You ready?
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.960]   Number one, just know who you are, right?
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.320]   Just know who you are.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.000]   Deborah didn't say, "I'm a man.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.280]   You want to go, sister O?
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.120]   Let's go."
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.960]   She just said, "I'm a woman, and I'm just going to find, I'm going to preach the word
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.560]   of God until somebody listens to it."
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.800]   Girls, you don't have to be pregnant or wear pants to be valuable to God.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.080]   Just be God's woman.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.240]   Speak the truth in love.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.920]   Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.040]   Show true beauty.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:22.400]   Stay humble.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.840]   Live for him.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   Serve the Lord.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.880]   Man, all through scripture you see this.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.400]   Shamgar, at the very end of Judges chapter three, Shamgar was a farmer.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.640]   He was the second judge.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   You know what he did?
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.320]   He killed hundreds of people with an ox goat.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   You know what an ox goat is?
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.320]   It's a stick.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.240]   It was just somebody said, "That's about enough.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   God, let's do something."
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   God goes, "What do you got?"
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.240]   He goes, "I got a stick."
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.720]   He goes, "Let's go kill hundreds of people."
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.240]   Who can do that?
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.600]   God can do that.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:53.280]   When you take common people who have faith in an uncommon God, they do uncommon things.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.560]   Just know who you are, and just know who God is.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.240]   He loves you.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.120]   Hey, feed these people.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   We can't feed these people.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.920]   Well, we found some kid we think we can beat up.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:09.800]   He's got five loaves and some fish, but what are these?
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.480]   Before so great a people, Jesus, bring them to me.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.040]   Watch what I can do with them.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.440]   Moses, let my people go.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.040]   Well, what am I going to do?
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.040]   You got a stick?
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   Great.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   Use your stick.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.640]   I could go on and on and on.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.440]   David, kill the giant.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   What are you going to use?
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   Do you want the armor?
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.280]   No, I got a sling and I got God.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   That's enough.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:37.720]   Now, you don't even need a sling, a stick, or five loaves and two fish, man.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:44.320]   You got to use what you have.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:51.760]   Deborah was useful because she knew who she was, and she knew in light of who God was
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   that God could use her.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   I tell people all the time, no man is uneducated who knows their Bible, and no person is wise
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.440]   who is ignorant of his teachings.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.440]   So know who you are.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:06.120]   You're a child of God waiting to be redeemed, or you are a child of God redeemed.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.880]   You just pop up your palm tree and you go.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   Use what you have.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.680]   I basically already taught you this point right here.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:19.320]   Common weak people with faith in a strong God do uncommon things.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.320]   Use what you have.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.320]   You got a Bible?
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.320]   You got faith in it?
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.680]   You got a community of friends to encourage you?
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:32.280]   Change the world.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:37.080]   Surrender your heart to God and watch him change the world.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.240]   Then strengthen the hearts of others.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.360]   That's what Deborah did, isn't it?
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:45.000]   Great women and great men make others excel still more.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.720]   Iron sharpens iron, and Deborah was iron.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.880]   So who's a Deborah you sit with?
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:54:02.200]   If you're a Deborah, who are the barracks you're calling to summon to sit with you?
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.520]   I'll just read this one little passage.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.120]   It just fits too well here just to blow it off, and then the last point's just a sentence.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.240]   But this is what Paul says when he was writing to the church in Philippi.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.880]   He says this, "For to me to live is Christ, to die is gain.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.080]   For if I'm to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me, and I do not know
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   which to choose.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.080]   I'd rather go be with God.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.200]   I'm ready to rest.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.920]   But I think if I stay here, it's going to be helpful to others.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.960]   So I'm hard-pressed from both directions.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.000]   Do I go to, you know, I desire to depart and be with Christ?
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   That's very much better.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.800]   Yet to remain in the flesh is necessary for you because God still has me here and you
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.040]   need a palm tree.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.040]   So I'm convinced of this.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.840]   I know that I'm going to remain and continue with you all for the progress of your faith
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   and your joy."
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   Now watch this.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   You want to know how I know if you're a Deborah?
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   Girls?
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.120]   You want to know if you're a Deborah if this week there are people because they're near
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   you make progress in their faith and increase in joy?
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.660]   Guys, you want to know how you're a Daniel?
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.900]   This is how you can know.
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.400]   You know because you're not here dabbling with wickedness.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.360]   You know it's so much better to be with Christ, but because Christ is with you and left you
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:10.100]   here, it's for one purpose, and that is for you to help other people progress in their
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.080]   faith and understanding of God.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.360]   And when they do, they will increase in their joy.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   And when you live that way, here's your fourth point, know who you are, use what you have,
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.960]   strengthen the heart of others, watch your God go to work.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.520]   I've seen it happen, man.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:36.480]   I was a skinny buck-toothed kid who was more persuaded by wickedness than truth, who got
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:42.560]   strong and athletic so I could be wicked like the other strong boys.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.880]   And I realized who I was was no good king.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.220]   And so I gave God what I had, which is the life that had not been spiritually formed
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.800]   as a young man.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.520]   And I said, "Well, can you reparent me?"
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.400]   And lo and behold, he did.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.400]   He forgave me.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:01.680]   He got rid of the vomit in me and he had me stop going back to the vomit that I'd cast
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   out.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:06.420]   And he started to let me use my life to strengthen others.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.000]   And just like I pray you will, 20 years ago I just gathered some friends in this city
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.800]   and I said, "Let's just start to do something for others.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.040]   And God, we're going to watch you go to work."
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.200]   And here you sit.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:25.280]   Father, I pray that you would raise up some Deborahs and some Daniels, some godly men
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:30.840]   and godly women, some women that seek you first and reject the lie that anything or
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.200]   anyone can satisfy you.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   I pray that they learn to speak faithfully, that they love others with a godly wisdom
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:41.960]   and a boldness and a kindness as a faithful completer of others.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.600]   Father, thank you just for, man, just all the written, this is Stinking Judges 4, Father.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.680]   We're in this book that's just like, "What is that?
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:49.680]   What's in there for me?"
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:54.640]   And we had to rush through an hour and leave so much on the table because you love us so
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   much.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.640]   There's so much good truth there.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.160]   Would you just give us a hunger for your word, more of it?
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:06.680]   And would the spirit of God fall on this place right now, somebody who's thirsty?
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.280]   Would you plant a palm tree of forgiveness and redemption and strength in their life?
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.560]   And would you get the glory in Jesus' name?
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.320]   Hey guys, thanks so much for listening.
