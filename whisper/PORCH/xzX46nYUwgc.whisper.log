[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [ Background noise ]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   >> All right, what's up everybody in the room?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   All of our Porch Live locations, I'm going to list them out because it's a new series.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Porch Live, Fort Worth, North Houston, Austin, Texas, Midland, Texas, Scottsdale, Arizona, Boise, Idaho, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Cincinnati, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Indianapolis, and Greater Lafayette.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   We are launching into, launching into a brand new series on dating and relationships.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And hopefully extracting from God's word helpful principles related to all things love and of course marriage.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now, when I was around 20, you know, college, shortly after college, I realized that I was ignorant of wedding invitation protocol.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Specifically as it related to when you received an invitation to a wedding, the rules, unspoken rules, if you will, as it relates to who you can attend and can attend with.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Here's what I mean.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I would receive those invitations and like all through college, really until I got married and we had to do our own invitations.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   It would be an invitation, a friend was getting married and I'd open it up and it would say, you know, number of guests, one.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And I assumed that if you're invited to a wedding, you can always bring a date.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   No matter if they have a plus one or not.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So I would just cross out the plus one and I would put two on there.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And every wedding I went to as a single unmarried person, I always brought a date with me.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I just thought, you know, of course, if I'm going to a wedding, I'm going to bring a date.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Whether I was dating someone or not, it just was a part of it.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Like there were multiple, in fact, on one occasion I brought two because I was just like, yeah, we're bringing a couple of friends.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's going to be a party.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's going to be great.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   In fact, the way that I met my wife was I got invited to a wedding up here in Dallas.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It's like when we were in college and the way I started dating my wife and I got an invitation and I did what I had done because I didn't know there was a rule that if they only say you can come, only you come.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I was like, no, more than marriage.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's going to be a party.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And an hour or two before I left College Station to head to Dallas for this wedding, I bumped into my wife's best friend at the time.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I wasn't dating my wife or anything.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I was like, hey, do you have plans this weekend?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   You want to go to a wedding?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   We got in the car, went up to a wedding.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And later that night ended up dating or ended up hanging out with my wife and my wedding date, which was my wife's best friend at the time.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I just didn't know there was certain protocol and rules on, you know, when you get that invitation, this is only for you.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   In fact, I think we should change that rule, that that's a story for another time.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Now, what does that have to do with what we're going to talk about?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Well, really in this entire series, just like in that scenario of not knowing who to bring to the wedding, who's in bounds and who's not, what's appropriate and what's not.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   This whole series is aimed at giving clarity as best we can from God's Word on who you should bring to the wedding.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Not any wedding. Your wedding.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   In other words, the type of person to date, how to date, and to look for and to be in dating and eventually in marriage.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And our attempt to extract from God's Word principles as it relates to dating in a way that aligns with God's best.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   As it relates to the importance of this topic, because I know in the room there's certain people are like, oh my gosh, a dating series.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Just a reminder that I'm single again.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And there's other people who are like, just chomping at the bit.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   You're like, I don't come to the porch any other Tuesday. I'm just here for this. I'm looking for love. I'm looking for love.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's the spectrum in the room.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   The nervous laughter is typically the people who are there.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   But there are a few things that in your life are going to make as significant of an impact on your future as who you marry.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And the thing that's going to impact and determine who you marry is who you date and how you date.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   80% of the room statistically will get married by around the age of 35.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Now that's not a guarantee, but that's statistically likely.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I mean, think about that. That's an enormous percentage.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   That means everybody but this section is getting married.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And I apologize. And you guys are going to be single for forever.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   You're really excited about that.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I mean, statistically, that's likely.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And so if that decision and evaluation is coming up, and maybe you're in that season right now,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and there's relationships that exist inside of the room,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   and how would God have you date one another, honor one another?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Maybe you're in a season of singleness, and you feel like God may be preparing or calling you,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and there is somebody that you should date.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And so we're going to spend time just talking all throughout about what it looks like to date well,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   who to look for as it relates to a guy, who to look for as it relates to a girl, how to date,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and what God's Word has to say about that.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But tonight, I want to speak to a very specific group in the room.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And it is a group that may not even identify with the next sentence I'm going to say,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   but you are single, and you are not ready to mingle.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And by that, I don't mean that you are not interested in dating.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You may not even be interested in dating.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But as it relates to is it wise right now for you to date, the answer would be no.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   That there's a season that you should spend solidifying your relationship with the Lord,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   getting healthy, working through, and preparing for that season of dating.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Candidly, there are some couples in the room that we're going to look at three reasons
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   or three scenarios of when you should not date.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And these scenarios may apply to you and your relationship.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And the last thing I want is for you to come in here and feel beat down, feel discouraged, feel any of that.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   But I do want to provide clarity because it is such an enormous decision
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   that's going to impact your future and your life.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Next to trusting in Jesus as your Lord and Savior, who's going to be your master?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Who will be the mate that you walk through life with?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   For anyone who's going to get married, it's the most significant decision you're going to make.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And so God, because He loves you, wants to provide wisdom and truth and principles
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and does all throughout the scripture on the type of marriage and type of woman to look for.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Now, I want to start by looking at a story in John chapter 3 as we look at these three things.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   John chapter 4, I saw it. I apologize.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   In John chapter 4, we're introduced to arguably the most relationally dysfunctional person in all of the Bible.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And she is currently single or she's currently unmarried.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   By single, I mean unmarried.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And Jesus pursues this woman and what makes up her relational history and baggage
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   has some overlap with the three things and three times scenarios where you should not date.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And if these apply to you, it may be time for you to hit the brakes on the relationship,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   to hit pause on dating in general, and to strengthen and solidify your relationship with the Lord.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Because you're never going to get a relationship with a spouse right if you don't have a relationship with the Lord right.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And God loves you. And He wants you to experience all of His best in the dating context.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   But we're going to look at this woman. I'm going to fly through the story and then extract a few things
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   out of these three scenarios of when not to date.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And in John chapter 4, starting in verse 4, it says this.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Talking about Jesus.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   "Now he had to go through Samaria."
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Now this is interesting and I'll move quick here, but when it says Jesus had to go through Samaria, that's unusual.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   John, when he wrote this, his audience, the readers, would have gone, "What?"
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Because Jewish men and women, they didn't go through Samaria.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Samaria was kind of a neighboring country and area and they had hostility with the Jewish people.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It was just like, "We got bad blood."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And so they wouldn't go through that area because there was racial tension and hostility.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   But Jesus says, "I don't operate like everybody does. I have to go through Samaria."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Because there is a woman that I want to meet and I have a conversation plan to take place.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So Jesus says, "We're going through Samaria."
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   So it begins to explain where they go in Samaria, this area.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   "It was near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Jacob's well was there. Jesus was tired from his journey, sat down by the well, and it was about noon
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   when a Samaritan woman came to draw water.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And Jesus said to her, 'Will you give me a drink?'
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   His disciples had gone in town to buy food.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   The Samaritan woman said to him, 'You're a Jew and I'm a Samaritan woman.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   How can you ask me for a drink?'
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   For Jews do not associate with Samaritans,'" John says.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So it's the middle of the day. It's blazing heat.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Jesus sits down at this well. It's the Middle East.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's 100 plus degrees outside, incredibly hot.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And someone shows up at the well that would have been unexpected, an unusual time.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   You didn't go to the well to get water in the blazing heat of the day,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   unless you were trying to avoid people.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And we're going to discover this woman had a lot of relational baggage.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   She had a past. She had a present.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   She had some real shame that she carried.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   In other words, Samaritans were outcasts.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   She was an outcast of outcasts.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   She's going to the well at noon to avoid people.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And she shows up, and her worst case scenario that she can imagine is sitting at the well.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It's not just there's people around.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   There's a man here, and it's not just any man.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   It is a Jewish man. Jews don't like women like me.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And then he asks her for a drink, which to us, you know, we're like, 'Is that really a big deal?'
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   He's saying, 'Can I use--can we share the same cup?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'm going to associate myself with you.'
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   So of course she's perplexed.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And that day, men didn't talk to women who are not their wives,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   and he's not just talking to her.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   He's asking her, 'Can I have a drink?'
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Jesus answered in her response to, 'How can you ask me?'
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And he says a line that only Jesus could get away with.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So imagine, you're this lady. You're sitting at the well.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   There's this stranger that's sitting there.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I mean, to us, we read that, and we see the imagery.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   We know it's an illustration. It's beautiful.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You would ask me, it would give you living water.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   But when you're a Samaritan woman who carries all kinds of shame in the blazing heat of the day,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   and you show up, and there's some guy who asks you for a drink,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and then says, 'You know what? In fact, you should have asked me,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and I would have given you water that's alive.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It's not beautiful. It's weird.'
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And so she's going, 'Water that is alive? What are you talking about?'
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And she rightfully goes, 'Sir, you don't even have anything to draw the water with,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   and it's a deep well. Where can you get this living water?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Are you greater than our father Jacob, basically the guy who made this well,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?'
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Jesus answered, 'Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   But whoever drinks the water that I give them will never thirst.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   The water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.'"
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Jesus is using a metaphor, and he's saying,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   just like that physical water quenches your physical thirst,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I offer a satisfaction, something that can quench your spiritual thirst.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   I offer a lasting satisfaction that nothing else in this world can provide.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   "Sir," the woman said, I'm sorry, then the woman said to him,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   "Sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   So she's still not connecting the dots and still doesn't get it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   She's just going, 'Give me the alive water so I don't ever have to come back here.'
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And here's where Jesus begins to lovingly just lean in.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   He said, "Go and call your husband and come back."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   She replied, "I have no husband."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And Jesus said, "You're right when you say you have no husband.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   The fact is you've had five husbands,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   and the one, and the man that you have now or are sleeping with, living with now is not your husband.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   What you have said is quite true."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And now we begin to understand why this woman was showing up in the middle of the hottest part of the day
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   when no one else would be around to get water.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   She carries this shame and baggage, relational brokenness.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I mean, five divorces in that day and age was unbelievable.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   I mean, it's unbelievable in today's.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It's very rare in today's day and age at that time.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And she had become so relationally dysfunctional that eventually she just gave up and was like,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   "As long as he'll sleep with me, I don't even care.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   He didn't have to commit with me."
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And now she's living with a man who's not even married to her.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And so she changes the subject and as a response to being uncomfortable of like,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   "How does this guy know everything, all of my baggage?"
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And she says, "Well, I can see that you're a prophet, and riddle me this, prophet."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And she asked a religious question, and then Jesus gives an answer to it.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And then she says, "I know."
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   The woman said, "I know that the Messiah, who's called the Christ, is coming.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And when he comes, he'll explain everything to us."
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And then Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you, I am he."
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The very first occasion that Jesus introduces himself and reveals that he is the Messiah
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   is to this outcast of outcasts, where he looks her in the eyes and says,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   "I'm the one you've been waiting for."
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   The longest conversation that Jesus has in all of the New Testament is with this woman.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   The most relationally broken, dysfunctional woman in the Bible
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   occupies the greatest amount of time of the Son of God in terms of communication.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   So let's just set the record straight.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Whatever brokenness and whatever issues and dysfunction
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   that is a part of your relational history or current history,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   if you were in the presence of Jesus himself, you wouldn't feel shame.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   You'd feel pursued.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And this entire night is going to be an attempt to learn from some of the parallels
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and ways that we look for relationships to feel something that they can't.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   But if you leave here and you feel shame and guilt and be down, that's on me,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   because if Jesus was here, you wouldn't feel that.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And if you feel convicted to change habits, that's on the Spirit.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And so I want to look at three things that are really parallels to this woman's incredible story
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and parallel to the ruts that she was in that we can find ourselves in
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and three reasons that you and I should not date
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   or three signs that you were not ready to date.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   So the first one, you were dating delusional.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You were dating delusional.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Let me explain what I mean.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Each of us is going to be a D.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Delusional is when you are deceived.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   You're underneath the--you believe something that's not true.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's akin to thinking and believing in lies.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   This woman had likely fallen into a myth that a lot of us fall in today,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   which is, "Man, if I could just find the right person, then this relationship would work."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And after one failed marriage, after another failed marriage, after another,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and constantly going, you know, "The problem is him.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I just need to find the right person."
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   And it's delusional to assume that after five different broken relationships,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   the problem is always them.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   If you are always at the scene of the car crash, you need to begin to ask the question,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   "Maybe I am part of the problem here."
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   If the common denominator in every broken relationship in your life is you,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   then it could be worth addressing you.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   This woman had bought in a delusion of, "Someone out there would be better suited for me."
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Well, my fear for us, just candidly, is from the moment you could read and think
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and take in information from the very first time, very first memories that you have,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   you have been discipled as it relates to love and dating from the world.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Now, no one would ever call it that, but you've been discipled by Disney
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   from the time that you were five years old.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It's true.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   You've been taught about fairy tales and love and what to look for and the hero,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and they lived happily ever after have been ingrained in your mind and my mind
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   from the very first breath that you took.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And fairy tales, I love fairy tales.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I love a good knight in shining armor, but fairy tales will lie.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Fairy tales tell you messages like, "Man, if the shoe fits, it's just going to be perfect.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   You'll live happily ever after."
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Fairy tales communicate really the same storyline.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   There's always a damsel in distress.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   She needs to be rescued, and you're looking for her,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   and you're going to be the shining armor.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   In dating relationships and love, you're not looking for somebody who needs to be rescued.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You're not looking to be the savior of somebody.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   You're looking for a partner in life, not a project that you're going to rescue.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And yet this message is consistently a fairy tale idea.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And then there's the more modern ways or more recent, you know,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   discipling from the world that has happened.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And that looks like just the music that we listen to, the movies that we watch.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I mean, Taylor Swift has probably discipled more people on love and the world than anybody else.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I mean, just think about all the ways that she has shaped.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I mean, I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Then why did you date him?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   But that message communicates.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I mean, every Taylor Swift song communicates the same thing, like,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   "Yeah, he's bad for me, but I still like it, but he's bad for me, but I still like it."
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And, "Ahh!"
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And that communicates and begins to make you think, like,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   "Man, I want to have a relationship where they kind of play the game."
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Like, they don't always just honor me and text me back, and they're just a little mysterious.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You know what mysterious is? It's shady, okay?
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   That's what mysterious is.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   When they don't communicate for three days, that's shady.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   That's not mysterious. That's not a quality to appreciate.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   But that's Taylor discipling.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Call it Drake. Call it the Rom-Com series.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Whether it's, you know, a Cinderella story, and whatever the name of that girl is.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   What was her name?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Hilary Duff.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   To Rachel McAdams and the notebook.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   You want to talk about dysfunction?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I mean, look at the storyline.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And they communicate, "Man, you should be looking for something."
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And, you know, it's most important to listen to your heart and follow those feelings.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And, "Oh, man, it's when the butterflies are there, you know you're in love."
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Here's the deal with butterflies.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Those fade.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Butterflies fly away.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   If you follow and live for that, you're going to have feelings that--
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   you're going to fall in love seven times a day.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I mean, all this is informing a lot of the ways we think.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Here's very specifically some of the ways that you are dating delusionally.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   If you embrace that, like I already said, they lived happily ever after.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   As soon as they got married, they put a ring on, happily ever after into the sunset.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   That has never happened in the history of humanity and existence and marriage.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Marriage is amazing, but it takes daily work and dying to self.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   If you get nothing else and you just hear this point, marriage is amazing.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Being married to my wife is one of the greatest gifts, but it is freaking hard.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   This is not for the faint of heart, because it is called on husbands to die daily to your own desires.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   When you sin against them, ask them for forgiveness to pursue and prioritize them above yourself.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And same thing with wives.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Paul even says this. He's saying, like, look, in 1 Corinthians 7, he's talking about marriage.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   He's like, look, singleness--and I know everyone in the room is like, "Yeah, you know, I'm sure it's hard, but at least you're married."
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   I want to just set up the fact that there's no happily ever after. It is daily going to work.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Paul would say this, 1 Corinthians 7, he says, "Those who marry will face many troubles."
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   "Those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you of this."
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   You're choosing in marriage, this is somebody I am going to pursue conflict with, be sanctified with, die to yourself.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   The moment you say, "I do," you are no longer you.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   That person is dead and gone.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And daily, you're now called to live in love.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Marriage is not dissimilar to the pandemic.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   This feels like a stretch, but follow me.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   The pandemic, anything that was weak was exposed.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It strengthened things that were strong, and they even grew stronger.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   But we saw families, businesses, churches, our world, go through the trauma and the challenge.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Marriage is not traumatic. It is a daily dying to yourself, though.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It's not a happily ever after. That's a fairy tale. That's a child's way of thinking.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Another way of thinking would be listen to your heart.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Listen to your heart. Some of you guys have parents that tell you this.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   When you're evaluating, what does your heart say?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And they're often well-meaning, but the Bible says when your heart is the compass by which you live,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   you're living according to a compass that will lead you to a really bad destination.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   It will lie to you.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   It's like following a broken compass, and you're like, "I think it's north," and you're going the total wrong direction.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   In Jeremiah 17, verse 9, it says, "The heart is deceitful above all things,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   above anything else."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Jeremiah says your heart is in its own category of how it can deceive you.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   That's why some of you guys are in relationships, and you come to the porch, and you love Jesus.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Sure, some of you do, or a lot of you do.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   But you're dating somebody, and you know he's not who God says you should date,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   or you know she's not who God says you should date.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   But your heart has moved you and made you go, "Yeah, but we're working on it,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and she's going to get there, and we have a song, and we just love each other,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and the hills are alive with the sound of music when I hold her hand."
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And that's your heart deceiving you.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   The Bible says we're to have wise, just counselors, people in our life who speak into that relationship,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   that listening to your heart is a foolish way to live.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   It's another one, that you would embrace this delusional mindset that there is one person out there for you.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   The one.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Man, this is common.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I mean, church Christian circles talk about this.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   "Hey, there's a soulmate, and when God made them, he had you in mind."
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Now, that sounds really great with Justin Timberlake singing it.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's just not biblically true.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   That my wife was not made for me.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   She was made for God and to have a relationship with him.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   I wasn't made for my wife.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   She's not there to complete me.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I was made for a relationship with God.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   There is no "the one" for you.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   There is a group of people called God's people, and there is a someone from amongst that group
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   that has the characteristics and criteria that you can choose to pursue and to marry,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   but there is no "the one" out there that you are looking for and waiting for.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   You are looking for the characteristics that God lists out in Scripture
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   that should be exhibited in a husband or a wife and a father and a mother.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   There is no "the one" not to burst the bubbles.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And it sounds great, and you know, we watch the movies and it makes us go,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   "Oh man, if only I could find..."
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   But you know that's not true.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Think about it. If there is just the one, with the divorce rate where it's at,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   somebody missed their one, and that means like a domino effect, just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   How many of us have...it's over.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   There's no "the one," but you can't choose from among.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   You can't choose someone from among God's people,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   which leads to the next one, a lie that is delusional.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And this one always gets people riled up, but it's the truth.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Make sure you're sexually compatible.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's delusional.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Hey, you need to make sure, you know, you wouldn't buy a car before you test drive it.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   You need to make sure you guys are sexually compatible.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Here, I'm going to just burst this bubble real quick, and I'm not trying to be crass.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Here's how you know.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   In fact, tonight, if you're in a dating relationship,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   you don't have to introduce sex to know if you're sexually compatible.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   You can come down front.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I will tell anybody that wants to know if they're sexually compatible.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Here's how you know. Ready?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   You're a man, and she's a woman.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   God literally designed the parts.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And I'm not saying that you should explore sexual compatibility with anyone
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   if they're the opposite sex.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm saying that's a box you don't have to really worry about
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   as long as you're a man and she's a woman.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Sex and making sure, like, hey, you've got to make sure you guys have great sexual chemistry.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You have your whole marriage to figure that out.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Great sex doesn't make a great relationship.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Sex doesn't make a relationship.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Sex makes babies.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And you don't need to worry of do we have that compatibility,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   which brings me to the last one.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Chemistry matters more than character.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Chemistry matters more than character.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Chemistry is--man, I'm not saying it doesn't matter, there's not a place for it,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   but if it comes at the expense of character,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   if the thing that you celebrate and really the reason you're in love
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   is just, man, every time we're together and we just--we both like the Cowboys
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   and we both, you know, love Mexican food and we both--blue's our favorite color.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And, like, if that's the foundation of your relationship and they don't have character,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   that is a recipe for a disaster.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Because character--chemistry doesn't get you through all the challenging things
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   that are in front of this room.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I mean, look at the size of this room.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Do you know how many miscarriages are ahead of this room?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Do you know how many diagnoses of cancer are ahead of this room?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Do you know how much challenging times are ahead?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I mean, we have a God who can sustain and is in control and is sovereign,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   but in those moments, you don't need to just enjoy the same music.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   When you're walking through the death of a family member, you need character.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And that is a higher priority.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Do they tell the truth?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Are they honest?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Are they trustworthy?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   How do they care for people around them?
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   How do they care for the family members that they have?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   How do they talk about somebody when he's not around?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Do they have character?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Or do y'all just have chemistry?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   First thing, like this lady, delusional dating.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   The second thing is dating dehydrated.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   You are dating dehydrated.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Now, let me explain.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   I'm not talking about you need to go get a water bottle.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I'm saying this lady clearly was relationally--I mean, of all the women in the New Testament,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   this girl was thirsty.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Five different marriages, and now she's sleeping with a guy who's not even her husband?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   We don't know all the back story and all the ways and all the reasons.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   But she clearly was attempting--and the story of the Bible is Jesus saying,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   "Hey, you have a physical thirst, but you have a spiritual thirst.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   You're trying to fill with a man?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   There's no marriage or man that can fill that.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   There's no woman or wife that can fill that.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Only God.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   You can search for the rest of your life and discover that."
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   And every person who's ever been married, they quickly learn marriage doesn't change your loneliness.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And you're not going to believe me, and it's easy for me to say.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I get it because I'm married.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   If you're right now going, "Gosh, I can't be okay without having someone in my life,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   and so I'm just going to lower my standards because I'm just so tired of being lonely,"
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   marriage will not fix your loneliness.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Marriage will fix your singleness.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   But it cannot fix your loneliness because that is an internal, soul-level, only Christ-fixable problem.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Marriage will change your last name, but it won't change your loneliness.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And it is so much better to be single and feel lonely right now
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and wait for someone who has the criteria that God says to look for
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   than to be married and lonely in the future.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   It is so much better to be single today and trust God and look for the characteristics he said,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   to be single and lonely today than to be married and lonely someday.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   That loneliness is a far greater depth, and you probably don't believe me,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   but I've been teaching on dating on this stage and at this place for 12 years,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   and I have seen nothing destroy the hearts and lives of people like their toxic dating relationships,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   the compromises that they've made.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And I just don't want that for you.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   And you've got to decide, "Man, am I looking for this relationship to fill?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   I'm looking for something to fill a hole in me that maybe they can't fill."
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Because they can't.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   You're dating dehydrated.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   You want to approach dating as a whole person, W-H-O-L-E, "I'm a whole person.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   I'm complete in Christ. If they don't complete me, I'm complete in Christ."
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Not approach dating as a whole, H-O-L-E, like, "I got holes in my life,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   and I'm looking for you to plug and you to fill them."
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Because they won't be able to.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   This woman tried and tried and tried and tried.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   She had five marriages.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Some of us are like, "I just want one, God. I just want one marriage."
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   She got five, and it didn't work.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I was on Instagram, and I did a poll yesterday and asked,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   "Hey, what are some examples of being relationally thirsty?"
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And y'all are crazy, man.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   So here's some of the examples and answers.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   [Laughter]
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   They dress like a harlot.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   They hop from one relationship to the next to the next.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   They only text you and slide into your DMs at 3 a.m.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   They're on every dating app imaginable.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   They have the Snapchat handle in their Instagram bio.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Hard pass.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Man, it's probably time for everybody to just retire Snapchat.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   [Applause]
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Wow.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You're welcome, TikTok.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   They'll take anyone. They wear revealing clothes.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   They continuously jump from one relationship to the next.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   They're always talking about how they just wish that they were in a relationship.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's all they ever post on Instagram about.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   They're serially dating.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   They lower their standards to address their loneliness.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   They're grasping for attention and thirst traps.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Now, those may not be the ways that you would say, "I'm dating dehydrated,"
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   but I would ask you the question, to be honest with yourself,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   like, "Are you dating from a healthy, strong relationship in Christ?"
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And some of you are. Some of you should date.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And you're in a great place with Christ.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And you're single. And I'm so proud of you.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And keep going.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   But some of you, you're dating dehydrated.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   And that person can't quench your thirst.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   You're asking them to do what only Jesus can, like salt water.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   There's no amount of salt water that can quench your thirst.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And if I approach salt water and want it to quench my thirst,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I'm asking it to do something it cannot do.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And you dating someone, expecting them to fill the hole that only Jesus can,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   is asking them to do something they cannot do.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And I have seen this creep in, even in Christian circles,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   where people, they don't even fully realize that they're looking for this person
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   to fill a hole, and then they get married, and they don't fill that hole,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and they go, "Maybe I married the wrong person."
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   In fact, almost every affair that I've ever been a part of,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   counseled, shepherded, cared for people that are walking through,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   happens the exact same way.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   In fact, an affair happens by somebody in this room, and I hope it never does.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   But if it does, let me just tell you the offense.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   It happens almost the exact same way every time.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   You ready?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   A couple gets married. They're in love.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Things are going well. They took the vows.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   They're together.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Bring in some little kids along the way.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   They're journeying through life. Things are hard.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Bodies are changing. Job's hard.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   All of a sudden, they don't have as much time to prioritize just the two of them.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   He's over here at work all day long, eight hours a day.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And you know what happens at work?
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   He's spending a lot of time around people and some coworkers,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   some of the opposite sex, and he's thriving.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   He's shining. He's got his best.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   He's had a cup of coffee. He's sharp. He's ready.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Unlike at night where he goes home, and he's changing diapers,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   and he's going through all those challenges at work,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   he's around people that are seeing him thrive
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   or seeing him use his gifts and seeing him what he's good at creating,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   designing, making.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And some of the opposite sex begins to connect with him and go,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   "Man, you're so great at that."
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   And it starts with an emotional connection.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And while that's happening,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and the flirting is happening back and forth,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   all of a sudden, they begin to spend more time together one-on-one.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And maybe it's at lunch, and it's not a big deal.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And all the while, just at home, things are challenging,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and life is hard, and it's stressful, and schedules are busy.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   But at work, it's like, "Man, we've got wide-open spaces,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   and she appreciates me. She knows my gifts."
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And you begin to confide in one another.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I mean, I've seen it happen more times than I could count.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And eventually, a physical line is crossed.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And you know what the mindset of this person
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   who's crossing that boundary the whole time is?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   "I think I married the wrong person."
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   The majority of affairs happen at work.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And they don't happen because people are going like,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   "You know what? I'm just going to ruin everything in my life today."
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   They happen because they go,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   "Oh, I think I married the wrong person,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and I don't want to be unhappy."
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And they're delusional. They're dehydrated.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   They think, "If I could just get with the right person,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   everything would be fine.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And I must have married the wrong one."
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   You have never married--
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   no one in history has ever married the wrong person
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   because they're who you're married to.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   But if you chase and you operate looking for none to fill,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   that's the storyline of how it always happens.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   So you want to be someone who dates complete in Christ
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and only dates people who are complete in Christ.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And finally, the last one.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Dating--when you are dating damaged--
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   now, I want to be really careful and be very specific,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   because I know already people feel like damaged goods
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   in this talk and just in general.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   By damaged, all of us in life experience hurts, trauma,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   abuse to varying degrees,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   but painful moments in our story.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   The absence of a father or the abandonment of a parent
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   or something that hurts inside of your life,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   and you have the responsibility and I have the responsibility.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   It wasn't your fault that that happened,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   but it is now your responsibility to heal from it
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   and not date from a damaged place.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But I've got the decision and you have got the decision
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   and the responsibility to decide,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   "I'm going to heal from the hurt and the harm
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   that happened to me."
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Because if you don't heal from hurts, from cuts,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   from things that will happen to you,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   you are going to bleed out on people
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   who never hurt you and never cut you.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   We say that again.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   If you don't heal from what happened to you,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   you are going to bleed out in life
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   on people, relationships, spouses, dating,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   on people who never cut you.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   But you can decide, "Man, I'm going to heal."
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   How do you heal from past trauma and past abuse?
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   We did an entire series called "Anti-Suppressants"
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   on working through this stuff.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   But one of the things you've got to decide is,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   "I'm going to forgive.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   I'm going to choose to forgive people that have hurt me.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   I'm not going to carry this anymore.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   I'm not going to let this person
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   have any more control in my life.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I'm going to forgive them."
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   And again, I'd encourage you to go listen to that message
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   on releasing that debt and entrusting that to God,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   "Anti-Suppressants" from earlier this summer.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   But I'm going to choose to forgive them.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Colossians chapter 3 says,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   "We are to forgive one another if you have any grievance,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   just like God in Christ forgave you."
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Anytime I'm doing a wedding of two individuals,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I ask a series of questions and meeting with them
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   and just getting to know them
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   and spend time with them before we do the wedding.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And I ask this question every time,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   "Is there anyone in your life you have not forgiven?"
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   And they'll think and they'll go through,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   and sometimes it's, "No, not that I can think of."
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And other times it's, "My dad, my sister,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   my brother, grandparent."
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   And I, as tenderly as I can say,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   "I cannot do your wedding until you forgive them."
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And that's not to be harsh or to be hurtful.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   It's 'cause Jesus commands us to in Scripture.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   And if I'm going to stand there and say,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   "By the authority vested in me,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   according to God Almighty,"
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   pronounce you man and wife,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   I can't with integrity say,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   "I am joining two people together,"
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   and one of them is saying,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   "I carry around hurts and resentment and bitterness."
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Because you two coming together in marriage,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   you've already shown that, "Hey, when I get hurt,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I'm going to pick this up and I'm going to carry it
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   and I'm going to hold onto it."
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   There's a level of which, "Man, if you hurt me,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I'm carrying this with me."
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   What happens in marriage is you have
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   the most intimate, deep relationship that possibly exists.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And the greater the depth of intimacy,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   the greater the depth and potential for pain.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   And you're going to have these two people come together,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   and one of them has already said,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   "When I get hurt, I hold onto resentment."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   So inside of that marriage, what are they going to do?
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   When they get hurt, they're going to hold onto that resentment.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And marriage is two people choosing to forgive one another
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   after deeply hurting one another,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   unintentionally or intentionally.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Billy Graham was asked, "What makes a good marriage?"
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And he said, "Two great forgivers."
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Is there anyone that you need to forgive?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Maybe one of the greatest gifts you can give your spouse
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   is saying, "Man, I have worked through and healed
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   a lot of painful things, and it may take time,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   but I can say, 'Man, I've forgiven
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   all that have harmed and hurt me.'"
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Another way to begin to heal is to deal with toxic habits,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   that eating disorder.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   If there's something you need to confess
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   to your community group, a pornography addiction,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   that is feeding and fueling lies as it relates to sexuality,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   a spending problem, that you've got multiple credit cards
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   in multiple different directions,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   and you've got a lease on a Range Rover outside,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and you're way over the top in terms of debt.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   There's a gambling problem.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Maybe you're coping with just alcohol,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   weed, nicotine, video games.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   That you would deal with those toxic habits now,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   because marriage, like I said, it doesn't make those go away.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   It magnifies them.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   You're putting pressure on it.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Whatever you're carrying, you can give the gift to your spouse
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   of saying, "I'm going to choose in this season to work on that,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   work through that."
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   When you go on your honeymoon, you're going to bring luggage with you.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   You want the luggage and baggage you bring
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   to be in physical luggage,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   not baggage that you're still carrying.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Or you want to minimize it as best that you can.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And that is a gift to your future wife or your future husband.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   And then spend this season prioritizing Jesus.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Maybe you need to go through REGEN, which is a recovery ministry
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   and dealing with different destructive hurts, habits,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   and hangups on Monday nights here at 6 o'clock, 6.30.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Prioritize pursuing Jesus.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Paul said in 1 Corinthians 7, "Use this season right now,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   if you're single, to strengthen and solidify
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   an undistracted devotion to the Lord."
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   My wife and I, we dated for a year,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   and then we broke up for almost two years.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   And there was no plan to get back together.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   We just reached a point where we weren't ready to move forward.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   It just was the right time.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   And it was horrible, and it was really painful.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   And I didn't know what would happen.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   But I decided in that season, man, I'm going to take a year,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   and just pursue and prioritize the Lord.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   That I'm going to grow in my knowledge of His Word.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I'm going to grow.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   And I was a 20-something single in Dallas.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   And the moment you decide, God, I'm just going to pursue
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and prioritize you for this season,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   it's like every amazing single lady in the whole world
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   begins to pop up all around you
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   after you've made that commitment.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   But it was one of the greatest seasons.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I look back, and I don't know who I would be today
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   if I didn't have that season.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   And it wasn't a result of,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   the reason wasn't because of a breakup.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   It didn't have to be because of a breakup.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   It was just a season where I could go,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   God, I just want to prioritize you
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and learn more about you.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And maybe if you are any of these three things,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   the gift you can give is go,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   man, I'm going to prioritize preparing for marriage
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   by prioritizing Jesus.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   The truth about marriage is it is far more important
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   and far more significant the preparation you have before it
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   than the promise you make.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Marriage is going to come down to preparation
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   and a promise, not a promise.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   It's not the strength of your promise
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   that is going to make it work.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   In other words, if this week, Dallas Cowboys,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Coach McCarthy, whatever his name is,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   comes out and he's like, hey,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   I promise we are going to win the Super Bowl.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   I am committed and I promise as hard as I can,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   we're going to win the Super Bowl.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   You would roll your eyes and you go,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   man, you can promise all day,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   but if you're not preparing,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   you're not going to win the games.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Because we know that when it comes to athletics and sports,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   it's not about how hard you promise,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   it's about how well you prepare.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   And the same is true in marriage.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   You can together be like, hey, boo, man,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   we're going to make it, no, this is going to be great,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   I'm really, really promise.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   But if you don't prepare, it comes down to preparation,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   not the strength of your promise,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   but how well you have prepared.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   In conclusion, these are three signs to exit in dating.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   You're dating delusionally,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   and you need to shift and embrace God's design.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   You're dating dehydrated,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and you need to shift and embrace
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   that Christ alone can satisfy.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   You're dating damaged,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   and that doesn't change your value,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   and you're not damaged goods or thrown out to the curb,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   but you got to heal.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   And you're going to choose,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   I'm going to prioritize healing and pursuing Jesus.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   I was in Mobile, Alabama,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   and I was speaking about a month ago at an event,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   and I landed and I got off the plane,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   and I realized I didn't have a belt,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   or I forgot my belt,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   and so I Googled and looked what stores were available nearby
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   and by the hotel,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   and it was a Marshall's.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   And I drove over and went inside of the Marshall's,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and if you've been into Marshall's,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   it's kind of like Ross or just one of these stores
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   where you go in and everything's on sale.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   I don't know that they've ever had an item
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   that is not on sale go into Marshall's before.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   So I go over there, and I'm looking at all these belts,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   and they're like, "This belt was $119,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   but now we'll sell it for a nickel."
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   And so everything is just like so marked down,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   and I literally bought the belt that I'm wearing right now,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   and it was $49.99 for $7.99.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   It's just like, man, who -- what is the business model,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   and how are they making any sort of revenue on this,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   and why are they selling these products so discounted?
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Maybe they don't think they're as valuable,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   or they are valuable.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   And then you contrast that with other stores.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Stores you go into, and they never have a sale.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   I mean, I'm talking like high-end stores,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   or even Apple, that you go in, and you're like,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   "Look, hey, is the iPhone, is there going to be like a sale
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   coming out, like 20% off?"
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   And they're like, "No."
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   You go into Louis Vuitton, and they go,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   "I'm sorry, we don't do sales.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   We don't do coupons.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   We know the value of our product,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   and we're not going to sell it short.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   We're not going to discount it and undercut its value."
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   The difference in those two scenarios is one says,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   "Man, I know its value, and I won't settle for anything less."
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   The other one says, "Its value is really not that big.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I'll take whatever we can get."
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   I want to leave you with this.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   This woman had the most broken relational history
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   of anyone in the New Testament.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   The Son of God shows up on the planet,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   and one of the first interactions that he has
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   is him prioritizing, "I have got to go to Samaria."
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Not he happened to walk through, and they were going along,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   and he said, "No, no, guys, hey, today we're all getting up.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   We are going to Samaria because there is a woman
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   who I have an appointment with, who I am pursuing,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   who I want to know, despite all the brokenness,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   all the messed up stuff, she needs to know her worth.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   And I will expose and explain that I am the Son of God,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   the Savior of the world, the Messiah,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   the one who paid for all of humanity's sins,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   the one that she has been waiting for,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   because I'm not done with her.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   And she needs to know her value, despite all the brokenness."
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   It doesn't change how I feel about her.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   He had to go to Samaria.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   And what you need to hear is God,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   no matter your past, has not changed how He feels about you.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   And he says, "You want to know your worth?
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   You need to stop discounting yourself
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   and giving yourself out and allowing other guys,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   and they don't meet all the standards that God says,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   but I just am afraid of being lonely,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   and real guys don't exist like they talk about at the porch,
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   or real girls don't exist like that.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   You don't sell yourself short because you know your value.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Your value is so great that God Himself
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   would die on a cross for your sin, for your life.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   That's how valuable you are.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   And when you come to dating, you think about love.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   You don't sell yourself short.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Discount your life. Discount your future.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Discount your sexuality, your marriage, your love,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   because you know your value.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Just like this woman, Jesus said,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   "I know everything about you.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   I still love you.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   I'm still here to die for you.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   It doesn't change how I feel.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   I want you to experience healing in your love life.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   It doesn't make me move away, though.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   I want you to know your value."
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   And I hope tonight,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   if you've never trusted in Christ and received Him as your Savior,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   the payment for your sin, He's so in love with you.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   And that relationship above any other matters most.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   You want to know your value?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Your value, according to God,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   was the exchange of His own life
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   so He could have a relationship with you.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   You don't sell yourself short and settle for a discount.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   You know who you are.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   And now date and live in light of that.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Let me pray.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Father, I pray for everyone in this room
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   who is in a dating relationship
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   that you would breathe clarity and life
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   into that relationship if you want it to continue,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   if it would honor you to continue.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   And if it doesn't, and if it isn't, and wouldn't,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   we pray that you would break it up.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   And we ask for your help in our hearts
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   as we journey through that.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   I pray for every single person here
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   that if they were honest, they would say, "I'm not ready."
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   And I need to spend some time prioritizing you
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   that that would happen.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   I thank you for the hundreds, if not thousands,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   of godly singles who love you and model daily.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   You are enough, you're sufficient,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   you're the one I was made for.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And God, we trust you with marriage
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   and we ask that you would provide,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   if that is in your will, a spouse, in your time,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   and help us to trust you with that.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   And I pray that this whole series
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   wouldn't just sharpen best practices on dating,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   but deepen our relationship with you,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   the one we were made for.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   We love you. Amen.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
