00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 [Applause]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 [Music]

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Cheers]

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Porch, man whether you guys are in the overflow or you're hanging out in Boise or Tulsa or Austin or in this room here,

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 man it is a huge honor and joy to get to be with you guys.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Again, if we haven't had the chance to meet, my name is Drew Worsham and if you were here last, just I mean I'm more curious,

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 by show of hands any of you here last time I was here?

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 [Cheers]

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Okay, thanks, that's super encouraging, I'm a little flattered.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Well, I knew coming back that there was probably no way that I would be able to step up on this stage and not do what we did last time,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 which if you were here, yeah, you're already ahead of me.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 For the last 15 years of my life I've spent traveling full-time as a professional magician or illusionist for the Christians that are here.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 [Laughter]

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 It's usually a joke, we'll see.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But I figured we'd kind of just kickstart, maybe do a trick if that's okay with you guys, is that cool?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 [Cheers]

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Usually that's the response.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Well, I was born in the 80s and then I spent most of my years growing up in the 90s and there was this really popular game

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 that was like I said popular when I was a kid and then it kind of fell out of fashion and then recently has kind of surfaced in popularity

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 and I think probably has a lot to do with this kind of 90s fashion trend.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And some of you may have one of these, you may have seen one of these, but just out of curiosity, do you guys know what this is?

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 [Cheers]

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Rubik's Cube, yeah, yeah, very good, very good.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 What's interesting about, well, just actually curiosity, and be honest, don't try to impress everybody here tonight,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 but just by show of hands, how many of you can actually solve a Rubik's Cube?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 If we give this to you right now, you could probably solve it before we left tonight.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Oh wow, very cool, okay, maybe one, kind of like you were nervous about it, maybe not so much.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 You, sir, you can, right here, oh wow, like people are pointing at you, probably means you were home-schooled.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 [Laughter]

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 That's honestly the first time I've used that joke, I'm glad it worked.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Tell me your name.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Ryan, you really can solve the Rubik's Cube?

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Just, were you home-schooled?

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yeah, you were, yes!

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 [Cheers]

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Ryan, just, hey, honestly, be honest, how fast can you solve the Rubik's Cube?

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Sometimes under a minute.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 [Audience "Ohhs"]

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I don't know if you heard that, but he said under a minute.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Sometimes, sometimes.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Sometimes, okay.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Gotta drop that disclaimer just to make sure.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I tell you what, Ryan, join me up here, will you guys give him a huge round of applause?

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 [Cheers]

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Yeah, keep clapping.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 He's got, oh man, I shouldn't have picked the guy in the middle.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Come on, keep clapping for him, keep clapping for him.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 [Cheers]

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Oh, whoa, nice, that was impressive.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Okay, step up here.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Ryan, if you would take this and shuffle it for us.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And make sure it's, it's just one of those cheap Walmart things, so be careful, don't drop it.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Sorry.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Okay, you feel good?

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Yeah, I feel good.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Okay, perfect.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Ryan, this is where this gets to be fun.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I want you to take it and put it behind your back.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And here's what's going to happen in just a second.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 In just a minute, Ryan's going to solve this Rubik's Cube behind his back without looking.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And I'll probably honestly, this is going to be maybe the most impressive thing that you've seen me do all night.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But if I told you you were going to do that, what would you say?

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I've done it before.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You solved it behind your back.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Or like without looking.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Without looking, you like memorized it though.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Okay, well just so that we're, man, I didn't think this day would come.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I didn't know you were that homeschooled.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So, I'm kidding.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Ryan, but you didn't look at it, you didn't memorize it.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So if you were to solve it right now, that would be a miracle.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And Ryan, be very honest, don't lie.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 We didn't set this up beforehand.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 This is the first time we're meeting.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And you really did shuffle the Rubik's Cube.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 You're not just playing along.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Okay, well tonight that's exactly what's going to happen.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 We're going to try for you to solve this Rubik's Cube.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And the way this is going to work is because right now it's impossible.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I'm going to try to get inside of your mind.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I'm going to try to influence every single muscle movement that you use with your fingers.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So here, I'll just go ahead and tell you up front, don't overthink this.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Don't fight it.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Like I said, just kind of almost like you're just, if you really could have this superpower, what it would feel like to solve it.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Now I need to take a good look at it.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 We've got green on the top.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Be very careful as you turn it, don't drop it.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 We've got green.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 See the red side.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 White.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Orange.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Yellow.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Blue.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And we're missing, okay.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Perfect, okay.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I think I have a good idea.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 On a count of three, you're going to just start solving that Rubik's Cube.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Okay?

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Like I said, behind your back.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Do not overthink this.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And this is going to blow their minds.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But to make it interesting tonight, just for fun, we're going to add a second Rubik's Cube into the mix.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And just to kind of have a sample here, I'll be doing this as well.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Now just, we want to, Ramsey, you can back me up on this.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 You bought these Rubik's Cubes.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And you and JD, you guys shuffled these before we came up here, I can't even begin with.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 So this should be fun.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Oh my gosh.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Are you ready?

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 A little nervous.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Okay.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 You got this, Ryan.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 You got this.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 You ready?

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Three, two, one.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Begin solving now.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Go with your impulse.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Don't overthink it.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Just keep moving.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Just keep moving.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Keep moving.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Doing great.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Keep moving.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Very good.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 You feeling confident, Ryan?

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Good.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Okay.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Stop.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Finish the move.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And here's what I want you to do.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 With the Rubik's Cube still behind your back, and your right hand open, would you just come take your hand and put it out just like this.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Ryan, in just a second, not now, you're going to take that Rubik's Cube and you're going to show everyone what you've done.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Now here's the deal.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Ryan, if you pull out a solved Rubik's Cube, the chances of you doing that are one in 43 quintillion.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Which just like, oh, that's just a big number.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Just if you're curious, you're more likely to leave tonight and swing by the gas station and pick one of those Powerball pick six and to get all six of them right tonight.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 But not only tonight and tomorrow and the next day, but every single day for the next 72 years.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 That are the chances.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So I tell you that to say that if he pulls out this Rubik's Cube solved, that's so impressive that it probably deserves a whole lot more applause than what's been given so far tonight.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 It may be a standing ovation for you.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Ryan, show them what you've done.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 [Applause]

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I thought you said you could solve it.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And you said you could solve it behind your back.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 OK, cool.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Well, at least one of us will do something impressive tonight.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Ta-da!

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I'm just kidding.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 This is impossible.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Seriously, you guys give Ryan a huge round of applause.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 You can have a seat.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Well, you can have a seat.

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Ryan, you're going to kind of have to be the eyes for everyone tonight because they're not going to believe this.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 But tonight you really did shuffle the Rubik's Cube.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 You didn't just play along.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 We didn't talk beforehand.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 You guys really did shuffle these as well.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Well, tonight, if one side of your Rubik's Cube that you shuffled were to match one of the sides of my Rubik's Cube tonight,

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 that would be just as impressive as this crazy thing.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Right?

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 That's impressive.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 That's awesome.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 They're not impressed.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Maybe it would be more impressive if they realized it wasn't just one side, Ryan, that there were actually two sides that matched tonight.

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Yeah, yeah.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Not just that, but what if there were three sides that matched as well?

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We'll just keep going.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 What about four?

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 No, this is -- okay, no, it's cool.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 No, no, no, no.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I see this all the time.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 But it's not just four.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 We've got five.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We've got six sides that match exactly.

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Would you guys give Ryan a huge round of applause?

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 You can have a seat.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Well done.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Yeah.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I thought it was cool.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Sweet.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I guess that one's more for me than it was for anybody else.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Well, tonight, right before walking up here on stage, a friend of mine, Austin, who traveled with me to San Antonio, we're on staff together at a church in San Antonio,

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 and he just, man, lovingly just kind of pat me on the back and said, "Drew, it's really easy to step on stage as a performer.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 You've done that for the last 15 years," or maybe even as a preacher.

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Tonight, if it's okay with you, I'd like to just maybe step away from just the performer side and just speak to you as a pastor,

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 and maybe even as a big brother, hoping that you would leverage your life for things that really matter in your short amount of time here on planet Earth.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 A lot's changed in my life since, I think, September we were here.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 My wife and I, we have a 2-year-old, which is crazy.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I think we have a picture.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 My wife's name is Jane, and we have a 2-year-old named Tilly.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 She's amazing.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I don't know exactly the timeline, but I think I left the porch, and the Spirit's just moving at this place, and went home and found out a few weeks later that we're pregnant.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I don't know if there's a connection.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I don't know if it's a porch baby or not.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I'm not sure how that works.

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 We're having a son come June, and we're pumped about that.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I share that just to kind of catch you up with our life, but also to let you know that we really do love you guys, and we love what God is doing here.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 This really is a special place.

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 We can look around, and there are places all over the country that want to tap into the DNA of what God is doing here in Dallas.

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 There are people in San Antonio right now that are gathering together and go, "How do we replicate this?

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 How do we clone this?"

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Because there seems to be a move of God because of the leadership here, and we want to be a part of it.

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 God is doing something really, really cool, and my hope is just to kind of step into a moment and just kind of keep it spinning.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I want to pray for us, and then we're just going to dive into God's Word, and we'll let Him speak for Himself.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Jesus, tonight, in these next few moments, hears what I know with all my heart.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Not a single person in this space and in this room needs to hear from me.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 No one in this room needs a magic trick.

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 No one needs a joke or a story.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Father, we walk into this place needing to hear from You because it's Your words that are everlasting.

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 It's Your words that have the ability to take a dead person and bring them back to life.

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 It's Your words that change us at the core of who we are, and so, Jesus, I'm begging You tonight to speak to us.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Speak to us in a way that we really can understand.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Speak to us in a way that our hearts can interpret.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 God, I pray that we would leave this space forever changed, not because of some lecture or some performance,

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 but because You showed up and You showed off and You spoke to us.

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And so, God, please, don't let me speak from my own heart and my own thoughts.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Let me just be a microphone that amplifies Your voice to Your people.

221
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It's in Your name we pray. Amen.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Well, if tonight you have a Bible, I'd love for you to turn to Acts.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Acts chapter 18. If you need to swing to the table of contents, please feel freedom to do that.

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 But Acts is right after the four Gospels. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and you got Acts.

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Now, as you turn there, I'm not sure if any of you guys remember Middle School Yearbook Day.

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 It's one of those days that you like wake up with a lot of confidence and you put on your guest jeans,

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 pressed to the hilt, maybe a Gap Polo, use some L.A. looks to spike that part just right.

228
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Just kidding. It is horrific, horrific memories.

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 But the reason I tell you that is because if you think back, a yearbook is ultimately a snapshot into what life was like back then.

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 A life was like back in that year.

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And I share that because we're going to dive into a pretty obscure chapter in Acts chapter 18.

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And what it is ultimately, I want you to see it this way, is a yearbook,

233
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 which is snapshots of what life was like for a few people in the story.

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And Acts 18 is going to introduce us to several people.

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And like I said, it's this kind of yearbook for the early Corinthian church.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And we're going to see what they're remembered for, what they live for.

237
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And most importantly, we're going to see a snapshot of how God accomplishes his plan in and through them with ordinary, everyday people.

238
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And so tonight I'm going to go ahead and kind of give you the punch line.

239
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I'm going to kind of give you the thesis.

240
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So if you're taking notes, you write this down, you go out to eat and somebody's like, "Hey, what'd that guy talk about?"

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 You just say this sentence and it looks like you paid attention.

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And here it is. This is what I want you to catch tonight.

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 If you hear nothing else.

244
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Is that God accomplishes his extraordinary plans through everyday, ordinary people.

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 That that's God's M.O.

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 That he accomplishes his plans to change the world through everyday, ordinary people.

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And that's what this yearbook is going to try to tell you and me that there is a God who has a plan to make cycles of all nations.

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And his intention is to use everyday people to carry it out.

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So tonight we're going to meet some ordinary people who are living for God's plan.

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And then we're going to see three signs so that you can know whether or not you are living for your plans or for God's plans.

251
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 That's our goal. Got it? Feel good?

252
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Let's rock and roll. Acts 18.

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Look at verse 1. And here's what the scripture says.

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It says, "After this, Paul left Athens and he went to Corinth.

255
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla,

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome."

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And pause there for just a second.

258
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 If you've maybe spent some time in the Bible or, you know, unlike me, like I didn't grow up in the church,

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 didn't know a lot of this language, but you may recognize Corinth here,

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 because that's where the Corinthians live.

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And the Apostle Paul is eventually going to write two handwritten letters to the church that he helped start here, this church right here.

262
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And so we get to see a little bit of the humble beginnings.

263
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 The first people who show up in the Corinthian yearbook are Aquila and Priscilla.

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It's a husband and wife duo who have literally been kicked out of their country under religious persecution

265
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 and have arrived in Corinth as refugees.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And watch this. Don't miss this, porch.

267
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 That's where God begins his plan.

268
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Two refugees.

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Like, think about this.

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 When their lives and their plans had totally fallen apart,

271
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 that's when God steps in and he begins to use them to accomplish his plan.

272
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 When their life looked totally finished for them, they were just in this survival mode in a new city,

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 God was just beginning to use them in his plan.

274
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And that needs to be an encouragement or a challenge to some of you tonight.

275
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 That God takes what looks like dead ends and he uses them for new beginnings.

276
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And some of you, that's how you walked into this space tonight.

277
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 You feel as though you're in a dead end situation.

278
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 That life hasn't turned out the way you expected it.

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 That you didn't get the promotion that you were wanting or maybe you've lost your job or you're still not married

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 or maybe worse yet, you still can't even get the first date.

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Or maybe, and maybe you feel like a refugee.

282
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 There's great news.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 That maybe your life didn't turn out the way you planned it or the way you thought it would,

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 but God is just getting started with you.

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 That God uses everyday people with everyday problems and everyday situations

286
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 to carry forward the greatest hope in the world.

287
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And that, listen, it's not just that he can use you.

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 It's that he plans to use you.

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So like, porch, like wrap your mind around that.

290
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Like so often it's so easy for us to step into places like this and we're like, no, no, no.

291
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 God can use you.

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Like that's your job.

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 That's your profession.

294
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And we feel like our responsibility is just to come and to just sit in the seats

295
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and maybe just happily participate.

296
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But what if God actually wants to use you?

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Like what if God wants to change the world through you?

298
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Have you ever thought about that?

299
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 That God used 12 teenage boys in the middle of nowhere

300
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and he flipped the world upside down spiritually because they believed him.

301
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Can you just begin to wrap your mind around

302
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 what would happen if just 8, 10, 12 of you in Dallas

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 or Cincinnati or Boise,

304
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 said God, you can use me.

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 There's nothing special about me.

306
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 If I'm honest, I feel like I'm at a dead end and I've got very little to offer.

307
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And God shows up and goes, good.

308
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 I was waiting for you to figure that out.

309
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Let's keep going.

310
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 He goes on in verse 2, he says,

311
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 and he went, Paul goes to see them, and because he was on the same trade,

312
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 or he's of the same trade, he stayed with them and he worked.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 For they were tent makers by trade.

314
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And he reasoned in the synagogue, the temples in every Sabbath,

315
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 and he tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 So we find Paul, he's making tents during the week,

317
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 talking about Jesus at night, and then on his days off, he went and preached.

318
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Verse 5, when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia,

319
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that Christ was Jesus.

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garment and he said to them,

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 your blood be on your heads.

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 I am innocent. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles.

323
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So finally, the summer interns have arrived, Silas and Timothy,

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 and Paul shifts his focus from tent making to preaching the good news.

325
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Now, real quick, because if you're like me and reading this scripture,

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 you get to this part where he says, your blood be on your heads.

327
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And if we're honest, let's just be honest, if that's OK,

328
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 can you do that in church? I think so.

329
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 If we're honest, this is a little intense.

330
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And it comes across like this is one of those things like an angry fundamentalist would say.

331
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Like if you share your faith with your friends and they don't believe instantly,

332
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 you just look at them and scream like, your blood be on your heads.

333
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 I'm just being honest, not sure if that's going to win you a lot of friends.

334
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 So maybe don't try that.

335
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But unless you think Paul is lacking some compassion here,

336
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 I want just to give you a quick context.

337
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I want you to know that these are the exact same men and women that Paul longs to see come to faith.

338
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Like he knows that all he can do is share the love of Jesus with them.

339
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And Paul fills the burden unless he shares the gospel with them,

340
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 that he in some way shares the guilt of their condemnation.

341
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Like if he doesn't share with them, that weight is on him and lands on his shoulders.

342
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And so we know that he loves these people so much.

343
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Two chapters later, he's going to say that I testify that I'm innocent of the blood of all,

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.

345
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That Paul knows that he cannot control someone's response.

346
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Like good news, porch.

347
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 The people that God is sending you to,

348
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 the people that God has called you to love,

349
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 that's called you to use your life as a spotlight to point to Jesus,

350
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 you can't change their mind.

351
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I don't care how smart you are.

352
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I don't care how many books you've read.

353
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 The truth is, if you can talk them into it, the next person is just going to talk them out of it.

354
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 That only the Holy Spirit,

355
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 only God himself can open the eyes of the heart of a person and let them see Jesus is the treasure that he really is.

356
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 So, whoa, that's just a huge burden off your shoulders.

357
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Because real talk, the most, the reason we don't tell people about this Jesus that's captured our heart and our life.

358
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It's like, well, what if I mess up?

359
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 What if I say something wrong?

360
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 What if they ask me a question that I don't know?

361
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I just can't give you a helpful hint and just maybe,

362
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 maybe this will just like free you up.

363
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 When someone asks you a question that you don't know,

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 you just say, I don't know.

365
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Like I, I'm blown away at how groundbreaking that is for so many of us.

366
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Let me give you a quick example. This isn't in the notes, this is all free.

367
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Okay.

368
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 You come up to me afterwards and you go, hey, Drew, real talk.

369
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You really love your wife?

370
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Go, yeah. What's her name?

371
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Jane.

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 How many freckles she got on her nose?

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I don't, I don't know.

374
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 If that matters to you, I'll ask her if I can count them when I get home tomorrow.

375
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Like if that's a big deal for you.

376
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 But me not knowing the answer to that question doesn't change the fact that I'm absolutely in love with that woman.

377
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 The fact that I'm doing life with her.

378
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And so that's the beauty of following Jesus.

379
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Just because you don't have an answer, you go, I don't know.

380
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I'll try to go figure it out.

381
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I'm sure it's on the internet somewhere or somebody on the port staff will hook me up.

382
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Like I'll find out for you.

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 There's so much freedom.

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I don't know.

385
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I think that was for somebody tonight.

386
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 I'm not sure for who.

387
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But there you go.

388
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 That's what Paul's ultimate, it's not even the point.

389
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I'm so sorry.

390
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Let's just jump to verse 7.

391
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 He says this.

392
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The scripture says, and he, talking about Paul, left there and went to the house of a man named Tiddias, justice, a worshiper of God.

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Which just means that he was Gentile, he was non-Jew and he was a Christian.

394
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 His house was next door to the synagogue.

395
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his entire household.

396
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and they were baptized.

397
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So the next two people that we meet are these two guys with very strange names, Tiddias and Crispus.

398
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 One's a Gentile believer, non-Jewish believer, and one's a Jewish believer.

399
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And I want you to see this.

400
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Tiddias, he puts his neck on the line by housing Paul, one of the most wanted men in the region at this time.

401
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And then Crispus, who's a synagogue leader, the ruler of the faith, hanging out with these people, he's putting his job on the line.

402
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 So both of these guys are risking a lot.

403
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Crispus essentially is putting his job on the line by believing in Christ.

404
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And Tiddias is putting his neck on the line with his community and his friends by housing a guy that really isn't that popular.

405
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Their bios, if you were to look in their snapshot of their yearbook, would say they gave up their reputation and they risked their careers to follow Jesus.

406
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But the verse ends with, don't miss this, "Many Corinthians believed," and this is the whole point of Acts 18, and really the whole book of Acts,

407
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 that God is going to do extraordinary things through everyday ordinary people.

408
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And I think that's what God wants to show us in this chapter, that regardless of your background, your race, your profession, or your relationship status,

409
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 God has a plan for you, and it ends with people falling in love with Jesus and becoming his disciples.

410
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 That even Paul, that we often put the Apostle Paul on a pedestal, and rightfully so in many ways.

411
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Like, I mean, the greatest missionary that our faith has ever known, starting about 13 to 14 churches across Europe and Asia and Africa,

412
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 goes on to write about 75% of the New Testament.

413
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Yeah, yeah, he's on the Hall of Fame.

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 But he was also just an everyday guy.

415
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Like, look at the next three verses.

416
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Verse nine, "And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, 'Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,

417
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 for I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people.'

418
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And he stayed a year and six months teaching the word of God among them."

419
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 The first thing God says to Paul, "Don't be afraid."

420
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Why? Because he was afraid.

421
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Paul was afraid.

422
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 He had already been beaten and rejected, and he knew he was going to get beaten and rejected again.

423
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And this is very important.

424
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Paul is an everyday guy just like us.

425
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 He's not Superman.

426
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 He's scared of what's coming, which should encourage you.

427
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Paul's an everyday guy with a nine-to-five tent-making job,

428
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 trying to serve God during a few of his free hours on Sunday in a fear of what following Jesus will get him into.

429
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And when it comes to faith in Jesus Christ, there are no extraordinary people, just an extraordinary God.

430
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Just everyday people that God uses for extraordinary things.

431
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 He has a plan for you and I too.

432
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And what this entire chapter is pointing you and I to is this truth,

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 that God accomplishes his extraordinary plans through everyday people.

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 His plan to make disciples at all nations.

435
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 His tools, you and me.

436
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 That God used people with pretty stable career paths, and he used people whose lives had totally been flipped upside down.

437
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 He even uses interns.

438
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 What did they have in common?

439
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 They chose to live out God's plan for their lives and not their own.

440
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Their yearbook, the slogan would have been trading our plans for God's plans.

441
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 So here's the question I want to leave you with tonight.

442
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And hopefully you'll have a chance to discuss this as you go hang out and grab coffee,

443
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 or hang out in the lobby, or go grab a drink with friends.

444
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 What plan are you living for right now?

445
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Like what plan are you living for right now?

446
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 What plan is guiding your decisions, influencing your relationships?

447
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Because you're all living for a plan.

448
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 The question is just which one?

449
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And whose?

450
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And so here's what I want to do.

451
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 I want to go back through this chapter and I want to show you three signs to help you evaluate whose plans you're ultimately living for.

452
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Okay?

453
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 So here we go. We'll go fast.

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 These are three signs that you're living out God's plan for your life.

455
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Okay?

456
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Number one, here it is.

457
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 You invest your life into others, not yourself.

458
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 You invest your life into others and not yourself.

459
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 And listen, I'm not talking about taking care of yourself.

460
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 You should.

461
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 But I think many of us have taken that expression way too far,

462
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 and it's all we do is take care of ourselves.

463
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And we need to figure out what does it look like to actually invest in the life of others and not ourselves.

464
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Paul moves in with Aquila and Priscilla here.

465
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 He works with them.

466
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 We know that from other places in Scripture that he develops a deep friendship with them,

467
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 and that's why, like, you see him, like, when he's in Ephesus and he leaves the church there in verse 18,

468
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 like, by the time he writes to the Corinthian church, he mentions them three times throughout the New Testament.

469
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Like, he's constantly referring back to them.

470
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 But Aquila and Priscilla, then they take their lives, and later on in this chapter, we won't have time to get to it,

471
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 they meet a guy named Apollos.

472
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And Apollos is, he's essentially a fairly brand-new believer in Jesus,

473
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 and he doesn't know the whole story.

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And so Aquila and Priscilla go, "Hey, man, we'd love to include you."

475
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 And they invite him into a conversation that we don't know is just, like, one time over coffee,

476
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 or if it's, like, months.

477
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 They begin to share the whole story with you, and they invest in him.

478
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And that even, this is so interesting, just something cool to notice that Timothy,

479
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 who's the intern in verse 5, Timothy's watching Paul invest in Aquila and Priscilla,

480
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 who then invest in Apollos.

481
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And sometime later, Timothy gets a letter from Paul in 2 Timothy 2, 2, and he says this.

482
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 He says, "Hey, Timothy, what you, what you've learned from me,

483
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.

484
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Timothy, what you saw me do by investing in others, invest in others.

485
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Like, what you watched me do, you do that.

486
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Pass it along.

487
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 This world is not just about you.

488
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Invest in others."

489
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Porch, can I ask you to just maybe pause for a second and think about your yearbook?

490
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Think about if we took a snapshot right now of your life, what would you be remembered for?

491
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Because how you're remembered is directly related to who and what you invest your time and energy into.

492
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Real talk, just think about that.

493
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 High school?

494
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 If you invested in chess club?

495
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Drama club?

496
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Sports?

497
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Like, that's what the snapshot shows.

498
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Where you invest your time and your energy shows you what you're living for

499
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 and what you're investing in.

500
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Can I ask you tonight, if it's okay,

501
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 who are you investing your life into?

502
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 I'm just going to get real for a second.

503
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Here's what many of you think right now.

504
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Drew, listen, I'm just trying to figure it out.

505
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 I'm just trying to figure this job out

506
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 so I can hopefully maybe get a date.

507
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 So I can get a date, so maybe I can hopefully maybe get married.

508
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Maybe settle in, maybe get some kids.

509
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Real talk, what happens is we go, "Well, I'll start investing in others once this happens."

510
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 I think I shared this with some of you last time.

511
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Then we go, "You know what? Here's what will happen is once I get married, Drew,

512
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I think I'll have lots more free time to start investing in people around me."

513
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And you're like, "Ah, you know, actually that wasn't true. That's kind of crazy.

514
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 But I bet when we have kids, once we have kids and a bunch of little people running around,

515
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 I'll have lots of time to invest in others."

516
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Well, maybe, maybe when they graduate.

517
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Maybe, and here's the deal,

518
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 many of you sadly, sadly,

519
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 will spend the rest of your lives saying, "Maybe then."

520
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And you will spend the rest of your life living for your plans

521
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 and not the plans that God has for your life.

522
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 And tonight, I love you enough to step into this moment

523
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 and to go, "You may be missing out on God's best for your life

524
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 because you've made it all about you."

525
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Once again, out of the notes.

526
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And I'm grateful.

527
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I'm grateful to have had a youth pastor when I was 17 years old

528
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 not only invite me to an event, but invite me into his life

529
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 and teach me what it looks like to be a dad when I didn't really have one.

530
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 And teach me how to love his wife when I didn't have that as an example.

531
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 I'm grateful that Danny gave his life so that I could know Jesus.

532
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 I'm grateful for a guy named Scott.

533
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 I was a young man trying to figure out ministry and how to perform on the street.

534
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Just said, "Let me, we'll worry about the magic later.

535
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Let me just show you what it looks like to follow Jesus

536
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 and not lose your mind while on the road."

537
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Church, who are you investing into?

538
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Are you willing to live for God's plan in your life

539
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 and then pass it along to those around you?

540
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Like that's it, that's discipleship.

541
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 It's choosing to give your life over to what God wants to do with it,

542
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 to make your decisions and build your relationships

543
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 based upon what God has called you to

544
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 and then bringing others along for the ride.

545
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And if that sounds scary, perfect.

546
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Because that leads us to the second sign that you're living for God's plan.

547
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Number two, you find security in Jesus, not in your plans.

548
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 In verse nine, it says, "And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision,

549
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 'Don't be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,

550
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 for I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you,

551
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 for I have many in this city who are my people.'"

552
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 God gives Paul two promises, his presence and his security.

553
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 He says, "I'll be with you," that's his presence.

554
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 He said, "No one's going to harm you," that's security.

555
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Guess what, church?

556
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Each one of you have those exact same promises.

557
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Matthew 28, Jesus says, "And lo, I'll be with you to the ends of the age."

558
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 My presence is with you.

559
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Colossians 1 would tell us this, that the hope of glory that you and I have

560
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 is that for whatever reason, that the presence of God Almighty,

561
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 the moment that you say yes to Jesus and you push all the chips in

562
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 like Texas Hold 'Em style and you're like, "My life's yours. You can have it."

563
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 And you step off the throne of your life and you let him be captain,

564
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 for whatever reason, in that moment, the presence of God Almighty,

565
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 the same God that spoke the world into existence,

566
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 chooses the take of residence inside of you.

567
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Church, do not be underwhelmed by that fact.

568
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Do not be underwhelmed.

569
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 So many of us, I can tell you just look at me, you're like,

570
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 "Yeah, yeah, Drew, big deal. We know that. God's in our hearts.

571
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Like we went to vacation Bible school. We can sing the songs.

572
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 We can even spell it. Like he's deep, deep down in our heart."

573
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 You know, like whatever the motions are like.

574
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Are you kidding?

575
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 The God of the universe, the creator of all things that we know,

576
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 like lives and dwells inside of you,

577
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 that the same power that rose Jesus Christ from the grave

578
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 now courses through your veins. Are you kidding me?

579
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Real talk.

580
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 We want the promises without the action.

581
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 The promises are for action.

582
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 That he gives him his presence and he gives him security. Why?

583
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Because he expects him to be a part of his plan.

584
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 And what we want is we want God, I want you to be with me.

585
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And I want you to keep me safe.

586
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And I just want you to let me do whatever I want to do.

587
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 And it is a fatal flaw of the Western church

588
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 that you believe that God is some cosmic genie in the sky

589
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 that just wants to bless your plans

590
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 when he has a whole new plan for your life

591
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 that's way bigger and way greater than you could ever imagine.

592
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 So many of us are searching after security.

593
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 While at the same time running from God's presence.

594
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Like we're searching for security but we're actually running from the very thing

595
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 that's going to give us security and the hope that we want.

596
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Like a couple months ago, my daughter Tilly, she's two,

597
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 she's just learning to walk and stuff and she's into everything.

598
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 I'm trying to change her diaper and I can tell she's just crying.

599
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 And I'm just like, let me just clean this mess.

600
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 But at the same time she's running from me.

601
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 And I keep trying, no, no, let me take care of you, let me clean you up.

602
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 I know you don't want to be in the mess, let me wipe this down.

603
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And so as I'm trying to get this diaper off of her, she's crying.

604
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 And everything in me is like, sweetheart, I'm not trying to take from you.

605
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I'm not trying to steal from you.

606
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 I want your joy more than you want it.

607
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 I'm not trying to take from you, I'm trying to help you,

608
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 I'm trying to allow you to be clean and to flourish and to thrive.

609
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 But you keep running from me.

610
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 And the very thing that I think so many of us desire and hope from,

611
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 we're running from it.

612
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 And trying to build our own plans and to live out our own security,

613
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 the question is, is your security found in Christ or is it found in your plans?

614
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Another side note, man, if you have, if you know Jesus,

615
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 you really have experienced His love, has your plans changed?

616
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 How has the gospel changed your plans?

617
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Because I submit to you, if they haven't changed much,

618
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 you may not know Jesus.

619
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 Tomorrow morning I wake up and something horrific happens to my wife.

620
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 My whole life is shattered.

621
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 My plans are different, not just for tomorrow night,

622
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 but not just for the rest of the year.

623
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 I mean, I'm messed up.

624
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 And here's why.

625
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Because I actually know and love Jane.

626
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 If the gospel, if you found out tonight it was one giant hoax,

627
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 that none of it was real, all made up,

628
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 how would your life be different tomorrow?

629
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 If the answer is not much, you may not know Him.

630
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Point three.

631
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Son, I didn't think this was going to be this heavy.

632
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 I'm sorry.

633
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Like never again we're walking out here questioning.

634
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 I really do, church, I hope that you know that I love you.

635
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 I'm fighting for you.

636
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 I really do want you to experience all that Jesus offers you.

637
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 The last thing is are you risking enough to need God's help?

638
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Are you risking enough to need God's help?

639
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 I'm just going to sum Arise Time's up.

640
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 I'll do two quick things, and I'm so sorry.

641
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 I want to ask you, and I don't know if they've got this,

642
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 I don't know if this will be helpful.

643
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 Actually, we're just going to bypass that.

644
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 We'll do this.

645
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 I'll land the plane here.

646
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 With everything in me, I believe that God absolutely loves you.

647
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 That the love of Jesus is more real than the chair you're seated in tonight.

648
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 And Jesus is inviting you into such a sweet story.

649
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 But to really follow after him, it takes you stepping off of the throne of your life

650
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 and letting him be the captain and letting him call the shots.

651
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Trading in your plans for your life and all the ways that you thought it was going to roll out

652
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 and maybe did or didn't.

653
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 And go, "Jesus, I'm going to choose to trust you.

654
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 I'm going to choose to follow after you.

655
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 And God, I want you to use me in really big ways."

656
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 All of us in this room are living for one of three things,

657
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 one of three symbols that this is helpful for you.

658
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 Maybe this will just kind of jar--

659
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 You're living for a ladder.

660
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Your plans are pointing to a ladder.

661
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Like this is all about you climbing and trying to try to achieve something.

662
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Or some of you, you're living for a couch.

663
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 It's all about comfort.

664
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 It's about you playing it safe.

665
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 It's about you getting enough retirement.

666
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 It's about you having a nice enough car.

667
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 It's your comforts.

668
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Or it's for a cross.

669
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 You take your plans in your life and you can fit them into any one of those three symbols.

670
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 Let me give you a quick example.

671
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Some of you, you're like, "Hey, listen, real talk, Drew, I'm trying to get married.

672
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 I want to be married. I'm tired of being single."

673
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 That's a great plan, but it falls in one of those three things.

674
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 You either want to get married because you're trying to keep up with your friends

675
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 and you need to climb up that social ladder and you feel like that's going to help you out.

676
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Or it's a couch.

677
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 "Drew, I'm discontent. I feel lonely.

678
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 I feel like that person will offer some comfort to me and will make me feel better."

679
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Or you see it through the symbol of the cross and you're like, "Hey, here's the real talk.

680
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Marriage has nothing to do with making me happy.

681
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 It's nowhere in the Bible.

682
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 It's a philosophy that's a little under 100 years old.

683
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 God cares way more about your holiness than He does about your happiness.

684
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 So God, I'm stepping into this marriage and I'm going to take the same posture that you

685
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 and it doesn't matter if I'm served.

686
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 It's all about me serving this person and helping lead them to the throne of Jesus.

687
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 And it's probably going to hurt really, really bad, but I want to give my life away to this person

688
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 because the cross is the symbol that I've chosen to dignify my plans.

689
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 And if that doesn't happen and I never get married, I can still be a servant and none of the plans change.

690
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 But God wants to use you to do something extraordinary in Dallas-Fort Worth.

691
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 I started this whole thing, Ryan, with the Rubik's Cube.

692
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 And what's beautiful about the Rubik's Cube, Ryan, is that there's really nothing special about this.

693
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 It's a bunch of plastic pieces that are on a little swivel device that move and shape.

694
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 I mean, legitimately, you bought these, Ramsey, at Walmart, or Target, I think, actually.

695
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 There's nothing special about them.

696
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 What makes the difference for the Rubik's Cube is whose plans it chooses to submit itself to.

697
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 On its own, it stays here jumbled and confused and frustrating.

698
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 Putting it in the wrong hands, and it gets even worse.

699
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 There's nothing ordinary about the Rubik's Cube.

700
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 What makes the difference is whose hands the Rubik's Cube finds itself in.

701
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 Tonight, I want to leave you with this. Watch.

702
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 [laughter]

703
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 One minute. Beat that, Ryan.

704
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 [laughter]

705
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 Porch, God has this rich history of taking the broken, confusing pieces of our lives

706
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 and doing something absolutely extraordinary with it.

707
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 But you've got to place it in His hands.

708
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 So tonight, I don't know what the next step is for you,

709
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 but I encourage you to maybe just sit for a second and go,

710
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 "God, what are you asking me to give over to you?"

711
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Maybe just take it—maybe not rush into the song or rush off to get coffee.

712
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 Maybe just sit and go, "Jesus, what are you saying to me tonight?"

713
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 Because I want to say yes.

714
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 Tonight, if you are in this room and you don't know Jesus,

715
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 surrendering your life is step one.

716
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 He loves you.

717
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 If you hear anything else from me tonight through this,

718
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 He is absolutely worth it.

719
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 So, church, pray with me.

720
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 God, I don't know what you're doing in this room,

721
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 but I know that you're moving.

722
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 And God, I pray that you would take these next few moments

723
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 and you would speak to your people.

724
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Would you lift our eyes to see you, to experience you?

725
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 And God, we walk out of this place forever changed.

726
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 We need you.
