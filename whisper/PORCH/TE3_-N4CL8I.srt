1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 Hi, Port.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,440
 Please take a seat as we read God's word together

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,200
 from the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 11, verses 28 through 30.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,680
 "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden,

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,720
 and I will give you rest.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,200
 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,520
 for I am gentle and lowly in heart.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,480
 And you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,520
 and my burden is light."

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,040
 Now our second message in our series, Disciple.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,080
 What's up, Port?

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,120
 How are we doing tonight?

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,400
 Hey, it's so good to get to be here with you.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,520
 We've never met before.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,760
 My name's Timothy Atik.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,720
 People call me TA.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,640
 I'm one of the pastors here at the church.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,140
 And if you don't have a church home,

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,760
 I want to invite you to join us on a Sunday sometime.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,840
 Before we jump in, just a couple of things.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,040
 One, I want to say hello to everyone watching online.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,680
 So Portslive Des Moines, Portslive Boise,

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,000
 Portslive Fresno, and everyone else watching,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,600
 thanks for joining us tonight.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,280
 Number two, I'm so thankful for Kylan Perry.

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,440
 Would you guys give it up for your leader?

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,920
 [APPLAUSE]

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,080
 I love-- I love what God is doing through him.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,960
 And it's such a joy to partner with him in ministry.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,520
 Third, we're about to jump into the word of God together.

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,440
 And I don't-- I don't know what your view of the Bible is.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,520
 But my view is that when we open it,

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,440
 it's like we're opening up God's mouth.

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,920
 We have an opportunity to hear from God.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,280
 So I don't know if you came here tonight expecting

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
 for God to speak to you.

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 But I believe he wants to.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,660
 And so I just want to give you a space real quick to pray

39
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,920
 and ask God to speak straight to your heart.

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,720
 So this might be new for some of you.

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,280
 Maybe you haven't talked to God in a long time or ever.

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,240
 But I want to invite everyone here to just say,

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,840
 God, would you speak to me clearly tonight?

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
 Pray that real quick.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:14,000
 And then I want to invite you to pray for the people around you,

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
 for the other people in the room.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
 Would you just say, God, speak clearly to them as well?

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,440
 [SILENCE]

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:29,400
 And then I want to ask you to pray for me.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,440
 Would you pray that God would speak clearly through me

51
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,920
 to you?

52
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:44,920
 Lord God, my prayer is that we would

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,680
 have eyes to see you tonight.

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,600
 I pray that we would have ears to hear from you.

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 And I pray that our hearts would be receptive to everything

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,000
 that you want to say to us tonight.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,840
 We give this time to you in Jesus' name.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,480
 Amen.

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,040
 Well, I want to start tonight by just sharing with you

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,780
 how I proposed to my wife on June 2, 2006, which

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,400
 was a long time ago.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
 But Kat was living in Dallas, and I

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
 was living in Austin, Texas.

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,640
 And I convinced Kat that I was going

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,680
 to have her fly from Dallas to Austin to see me.

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,160
 The way I convinced her of this was

67
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,200
 I bought her a fully refundable flight on southwest.com.

68
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,440
 I sent her the e-confirmation, and then I called Southwest

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
 and got my money back.

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,480
 And without Kat knowing, I made my way from Austin to Dallas.

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,640
 And I went up to her work without her knowing.

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,960
 I was in cahoots with her boss and her co-workers.

73
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,440
 They lured her away from her desk, got into her purse,

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,480
 came outside, unlocked her car, put her keys back.

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,400
 All the while, Kat had no clue she was about to be punked.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,920
 So I got in her car.

77
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,200
 I put two dozen roses.

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,800
 I sprinkled rose petals all over the car.

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,340
 And then I put a note that just said,

80
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,300
 tonight's a very important night in the history

81
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,160
 of our relationship.

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,880
 Change of plans, go home, and get changed.

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,760
 So Kat came out to her car expecting

84
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,120
 to drive to the airport.

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,000
 And instead, she found that Blissful Love had vomited

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,960
 all over the inside of her car.

87
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,320
 She then made her way back to her apartment.

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,480
 And when she opened the door, there was a trail of rose

89
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,400
 petals from the front door all the way into the bedroom.

90
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
 And there on the bed was me.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,120
 Not really.

92
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
 No.

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,720
 I'm just making sure you're paying attention.

94
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,240
 No.

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,640
 Scrap that from the recording.

96
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,040
 There-- I'm so sorry.

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,320
 But there on the bed was another note that said,

98
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,280
 see you at 6, two dozen more roses,

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,840
 and then a dress I had bought for Kat.

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
 And ladies, I know what you're thinking.

101
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,240
 You're like, you bought her a dress?

102
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,760
 That is so dangerous.

103
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,520
 And you're right, except the good news

104
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,120
 is that Kat has a twin sister.

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,680
 So it's like, would Kat look good in this dress?

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,200
 Yes, great, good.

107
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,560
 We're good to go.

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,000
 6 PM, Kat comes out of her apartment.

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,160
 I'm standing there in front of a limousine, two dozen more roses.

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
 We get in the limo.

111
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,600
 We make our way to downtown Dallas.

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,840
 There's that building that has the hole in the middle of it.

113
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,960
 And the floor right below that, there's a restaurant.

114
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
 We sat and watched the sun go down.

115
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,600
 And right there in the middle of dinner, I took her by the hand.

116
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,160
 And I said, Kat, will you please pass the sweet and low?

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,920
 And she did.

118
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,200
 And so we finished up dinner.

119
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,720
 We got back in the limousine.

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
 And we drove to my cousin's house.

121
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,200
 Now, I know what you're thinking.

122
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,720
 Like, you went to your cousin's house on the night you proposed.

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,320
 Yes, I did.

124
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,560
 Because my cousin shares a backyard with former Dallas Cowboy football

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,240
 player Darryl Johnston, a.k.a.

126
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,960
 The Moose.

127
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,680
 And The Moose had a private lake in his backyard

128
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
 with fountains and waterfalls.

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 It was really beautiful.

130
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,080
 So I walked Kat up the driveway.

131
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
 And I'd set up a projection screen.

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,280
 And I sat her down.

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,000
 And I pushed play on a slideshow that showed her--

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,720
 a slideshow of her and me from birth to present.

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
 She teared up.

136
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,120
 I said, bam.

137
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,640
 So after the slideshow, I walked her down to the lake.

138
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,360
 It was dark.

139
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,000
 But the path was lit with candles.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
 The water was dark.

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
 But we had put floating candles in the water.

142
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,080
 And there in the water was a rowboat with two dozen more roses.

143
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
 And I had Kat get in the rowboat.

144
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:38,960
 And then I rowed the two of us out to the middle of The Moose's lake.

145
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:46,320
 And there in the middle of the lake, I got down on one knee.

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,080
 And I asked Kat if she would marry me.

147
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
 And she said yes.

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,160
 And that was an incredible thing.

149
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,000
 And after she said yes, we hugged it out.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,320
 And then I said, hey, let me row the two of us back to shore.

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,240
 So let's knock on my cousin's door to get your ring in the light.

152
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,760
 So we went up to the door.

153
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
 We knocked.

154
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,800
 They opened the door.

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,160
 And her family was standing right there, which was amazing.

156
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,840
 But then 10 seconds later, 20 of her closest friends

157
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
 came running around the corner.

158
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,000
 And estrogen just exploded into the night sky.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,160
 And then we spent the rest of the evening celebrating the fact

160
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,280
 that a girl like that would say yes to a dude like this.

161
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,240
 That's it.

162
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,480
 That's all I wanted to share with you tonight.

163
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,120
 I'm going to pray.

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,440
 And then we can get out of here.

165
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,940
 All right.

166
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,280
 Hopefully your life was changed in the name of Jesus.

167
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,200
 Hey, here's the reason I share that with you.

168
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,320
 I share that with you because I'm really

169
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,560
 proud of the way I proposed.

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,360
 Some of you have probably heard it before.

171
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,280
 And you're like, dude, you're like mouthing it along

172
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,160
 because you've heard me share it so many times.

173
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,280
 I share it a lot because I'm really proud of how I proposed.

174
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,080
 I'm proud of it because of the lengths that I

175
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,760
 went to to invite Kat into a lifelong relationship together.

176
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,680
 And yet what I want to share with you tonight

177
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,280
 is a far greater proposal.

178
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,920
 It's a proposal that puts my proposal to shame.

179
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,000
 It's a proposal from Jesus Christ to you and to me.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,120
 And the lengths that Jesus Christ went to for us

181
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,400
 are far greater.

182
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,280
 And the invitation to us is so much sweeter.

183
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,880
 It's not just an invitation to life now with Jesus.

184
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,360
 It's an invitation to life with the eternal Son of God,

185
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,040
 not just now, but for all of eternity.

186
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,080
 It's an invitation into the relationship

187
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,120
 that you have actually been made for.

188
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,840
 So tonight, as we continue this series that is called Disciple,

189
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,360
 we're taking a step closer to Jesus

190
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
 because we don't want to just be people who know about Jesus.

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,720
 We want to be people who draw near and know Jesus intimately,

192
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
 who know who He is, who know His character, who

193
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,680
 draw near to His heart, and have our lives changed by Him.

194
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
 Now, when you think about my proposal with Kat,

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
 there was kind of two components to it.

196
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,880
 There was the invitation from me,

197
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,800
 and then there was the response from Kat.

198
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,760
 And we're going to see the same proposal from Jesus.

199
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
 We're going to see His invitation to us,

200
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,160
 and then we're going to see our response to Him.

201
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,800
 And the greatest proposal in the history of mankind

202
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,000
 is found in the passage that Kendall just read.

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,680
 It's Matthew chapter 11.

204
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,840
 So if you have a Bible, you're welcome to turn there

205
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,160
 if you haven't already.

206
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,280
 But in verse 28, we find the proposal.

207
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,440
 We find Jesus' invitation to us.

208
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,600
 Listen to what He says.

209
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,280
 He says, "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden,

210
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,000
 and I will give you rest."

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,500
 There it is.

212
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,600
 That's the proposal.

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,200
 That's actually the greatest proposal

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
 in the history of the world.

215
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,640
 It's honestly found in those first three words,

216
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,680
 "Come to me."

217
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,280
 So let's just clarify real quick.

218
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,960
 I need to make sure that everyone's on the same page.

219
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,200
 When Jesus says, "Come to me," it

220
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,800
 is nothing short of an invitation

221
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,160
 to be with Jesus now and for all of eternity.

222
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,600
 It's not first and foremost an invitation

223
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,360
 to up your church attendance.

224
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
 It's not first and foremost an invitation

225
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,760
 to open up the Bible and try your hardest

226
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,480
 to follow all of its rules.

227
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,960
 It's not first and foremost an invitation

228
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,640
 to just be better to yourself, kinder to yourself,

229
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,680
 and kinder to other people.

230
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,120
 No, it is nothing short of an invitation from Jesus

231
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,880
 to be with Jesus now and for all of eternity.

232
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,040
 And if you're exploring Jesus, you're

233
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,480
 not sure what you think about Him,

234
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,880
 I want to be clear that I believe--

235
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
 and this isn't just my opinion-- if the Bible is true,

236
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
 then what the Bible would tell you

237
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,440
 is you have been made for Jesus.

238
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,680
 Like your soul has been made to be satisfied by and in Jesus.

239
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,200
 So the craving of your soul for satisfaction,

240
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,240
 it will not find fulfillment until it

241
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,400
 is fulfilled by the one for whom it's been made,

242
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,840
 who is Jesus Christ.

243
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,480
 And so I just want to be clear, this is His invitation to you.

244
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,200
 It is an invitation from Jesus to be with Jesus.

245
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,480
 Don't let anyone sell you for anything less.

246
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,200
 Don't let them sell you on anything less.

247
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,920
 Don't settle for anything less.

248
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
 I'll explain it this way.

249
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,000
 Several years ago, my wife and I,

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,560
 we had some friends staying with us,

251
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,320
 and we could hear them in the other room on the phone

252
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,120
 ordering Mexican food.

253
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,160
 And it was right around dinner time, and Cat and I,

254
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,640
 we were both really hungry, and we

255
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,240
 were listening to them order.

256
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,400
 That sounds creepy when it comes out of my mouth,

257
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,560
 but that's just reality.

258
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,240
 We were listening to them in a different room

259
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,120
 order Mexican food, and we were like, man, I want that.

260
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,760
 Like, I want what they're ordering.

261
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,240
 That actually sounds really good.

262
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,400
 The only problem is we were on a budget.

263
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,040
 So we wanted like a restaurant quality Mexican food,

264
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,320
 but we didn't want to spend the money to get it.

265
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,360
 So we were like, let's do the next best thing.

266
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
 And so we went and spent over $20 on food from Taco Bell.

267
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,800
 [APPLAUSE]

268
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,160
 And look, sounds like we've got some Taco Bell fans

269
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,880
 in the room.

270
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,360
 So I want to be clear with you.

271
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
 I'm not trying to disparage Taco Bell.

272
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
 But the reality is that when you're

273
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,080
 looking for restaurant quality Mexican food

274
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,920
 and you go to Taco Bell, there's times of the day

275
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,360
 when Taco Bell will taste better than others.

276
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,720
 And the time we were looking to eat was not one of those times.

277
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,280
 So the food that we bought-- so just imagine spending

278
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,720
 over $20 on food at Taco Bell.

279
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,400
 That's a significant amount of food for two people.

280
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,480
 It resembled what we were desiring,

281
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,520
 but it did not taste like what we were wanting.

282
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,040
 And in the end, it resembled-- it

283
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,880
 looked similar to what we wanted,

284
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,400
 but in the end, it did not satisfy.

285
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,680
 My fear is that many people in this room

286
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,640
 are having the same experience with your version of Jesus

287
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,760
 or your version of Christianity.

288
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,200
 And so I just want to be clear.

289
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,040
 Maybe Christianity for you is doing things for Jesus,

290
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,480
 but you have little experience being with Jesus.

291
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
 If that's your experience, it will not satisfy,

292
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,600
 and you have settled.

293
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,240
 You've settled for the wrong understanding of Christianity

294
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
 and the wrong version of Jesus.

295
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
 Maybe Christianity for you is just

296
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
 about becoming a better person.

297
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,160
 You want to be more loving to yourself,

298
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,600
 more loving towards others, and Jesus helps you with that.

299
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 And at the same time, you don't necessarily

300
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,040
 need Jesus for that.

301
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,720
 If that's your version of Jesus and Christianity, in the end,

302
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,560
 it's not going to satisfy, and you've settled.

303
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,360
 Maybe Christianity for you is about going to heaven

304
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,000
 when you die, but for now, Jesus is more of a roadblock

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,320
 to satisfaction than a remedy for it.

306
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,520
 The Jesus you know is boring, unsatisfying, and exhausting.

307
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,280
 If that's the Jesus of the Christianity you know,

308
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,960
 I want you to know you have settled.

309
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,960
 If Christianity for you, if your understanding of Christianity

310
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,080
 is that it's a solution for the weak,

311
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,600
 it's a quick remedy for people who are in tough times.

312
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
 If that's your understanding of Jesus or Christianity,

313
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,200
 I'm just telling you, you've got the wrong Jesus

314
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,840
 and the wrong Christianity.

315
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,760
 Christianity is nothing short of a proposal

316
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,280
 from the God of the universe to be with him

317
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,000
 now and for all of eternity.

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,560
 It is life with Jesus, the King of kings

319
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,080
 and the Lord of all lords, the one for whom

320
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,920
 your soul has been made, and you will not

321
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,840
 be satisfied apart from him.

322
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,880
 And you might hear me say that, and you're like,

323
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,000
 TA, I don't know you, and you don't know me.

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,240
 So for you to state something emphatically

325
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,680
 that I won't be satisfied apart from Jesus,

326
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,360
 you might hear that and be like, look, I'm not buying it.

327
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,800
 And I just say, that's OK.

328
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,000
 Go on the search.

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
 Go look for satisfaction.

330
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,400
 There's people in the Bible that did just that.

331
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,520
 But in the end, the life you're looking for,

332
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,440
 it's only found in Jesus.

333
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,800
 Jesus has come to me.

334
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,760
 Now, as he continues, we're going

335
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,640
 to see who he's actually proposing to.

336
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,100
 Now, I want you to think about this.

337
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,880
 Before I talk about Jesus's proposal to us,

338
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,720
 I want you to think about this.

339
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,120
 If you're here and you desire to be married one day, which

340
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,920
 means there's a desire in you to hopefully either propose

341
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,960
 to someone or be proposed to, what I want you to think about

342
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,200
 is I want you to envision the person opposite you.

343
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,280
 When I say opposite you, I mean the person standing with you,

344
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,000
 the person either you're proposing to

345
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,920
 or the person proposing to you.

346
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,080
 My guess is whoever you picture, you only

347
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,600
 think about their positives, right?

348
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,840
 It's someone who's incredibly good looking,

349
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,240
 they're really godly, and they're really funny.

350
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,080
 No one thinks about their negatives, right?

351
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,460
 Like, I guarantee you, on June 2, 2006,

352
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,720
 on the day I proposed to Kat, I assure you Kat

353
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,500
 wasn't sitting there like, praise God,

354
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,020
 I get to be married to a man who's going to be moody.

355
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,500
 [LAUGHTER]

356
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
 He's not going to be able to fall asleep at night

357
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,540
 unless he's wearing socks.

358
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,420
 [LAUGHTER]

359
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,460
 And I'm going to have the joy of watching

360
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,860
 him go through a box of Kleenex every few days

361
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,300
 due to severe allergies.

362
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,060
 No.

363
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,260
 You don't-- I just shared way too-- you

364
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,260
 didn't need to know any of that.

365
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,780
 But look, to be married to Timothy Attick,

366
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,060
 that's what you get.

367
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,940
 You don't think about the negatives.

368
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,440
 You only think about the positives.

369
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,900
 OK, well now, I want you to see who Jesus wants.

370
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,500
 I want you to see who Jesus wants to be with now

371
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,780
 and for all of eternity.

372
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,620
 What does the text say?

373
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,260
 Jesus says, "Come to me," who?

374
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,340
 "All who labor and are heavy laden."

375
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,820
 Come to me all who labor.

376
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
 So that word in the Greek, it carries

377
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:26,340
 the idea of being worn out from struggling or grinding

378
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,580
 through life.

379
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,340
 That idea of being heavy laden, it

380
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,660
 means to be burdened or overloaded or weighed down.

381
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,220
 So just wake up, and here's what's happening.

382
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,100
 Jesus is saying, look, the people that I long for,

383
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,020
 the reason I left heaven and came to Earth,

384
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,260
 is for those who are worn out in life.

385
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,340
 It's for the people who are worn out

386
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,380
 in fighting, losing battles against various sins in life.

387
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,220
 Like the people that he wants are the people who

388
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,460
 are tired of giving into porn and tired of giving

389
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,820
 into drinking too much and tired of giving into hookups

390
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,140
 and tired of spending money that they don't have.

391
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,980
 The people that he wants are the people who are worn out,

392
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,580
 exhausted from trying to be someone who

393
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,380
 crushes everything in life, which

394
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,620
 means that they're well acquainted with what it feels

395
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,020
 like to be a failure, because no one can crush all of life.

396
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,100
 The people that he wants are the people who are exhausted

397
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,060
 from trying to please everyone, and the people

398
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,980
 who are so tired of the season of life that they're in.

399
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,780
 So maybe that's you right now.

400
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,900
 Maybe you're sitting there saying, look,

401
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,620
 I'm so over this season of life.

402
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,420
 Like you're so tired of being single,

403
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,220
 and you're so tired of your wedding

404
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,980
 not being on the wedding circuit that you find yourself

405
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,780
 stuck on.

406
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:58,260
 He wants people who are worn out from the heart in life.

407
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,860
 Maybe you're battling chronic pain,

408
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,020
 or maybe you're in a situation where you're actually

409
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,820
 having to parent your parents.

410
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,660
 OK.

411
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,160
 Yeah.

412
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,620
 I would imagine that there are people here

413
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,020
 who are in a place where you just say,

414
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,780
 I don't know I can take another day of it,

415
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,900
 whatever it is for you.

416
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,900
 Jesus says, you're the type of people that I'm looking for.

417
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,980
 He's worn out from people trying to be good enough for him.

418
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,580
 Like people who are exhausted from trying

419
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,740
 to be a good Christian.

420
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,900
 What's interesting is when Jesus says,

421
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,940
 come to me all who labor and are heavy laden, what's going on

422
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,220
 in the day and time that he was speaking in

423
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,340
 was that the religious professionals of the day,

424
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,780
 known as the Pharisees, these were people

425
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,140
 who took the laws of the Old Testament.

426
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,500
 There was about 613 of those.

427
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,580
 And what they did is they created pages and pages

428
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,020
 and pages and pages and pages of more laws.

429
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,500
 And they just began dumping all of these laws

430
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,580
 and requirements on the people.

431
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,220
 And they saddled them and weighed them down

432
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,100
 with all of these expectations that they said were from God.

433
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,940
 So if people were going to be God fearing people,

434
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,900
 they had to live under the crushing weight of these rules

435
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,580
 and regulations.

436
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,220
 And Jesus is like, man, these are the people that I want.

437
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,140
 The people that I long to spend now and all of eternity with

438
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,140
 are the people who are absolutely worn out on life.

439
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,500
 As I was preparing for this message,

440
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,260
 I was reminded of the scene in this Will Smith movie,

441
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,460
 The Pursuit of Happiness.

442
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,960
 I don't know if you've ever seen it.

443
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,380
 If you haven't seen it, that's OK.

444
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,700
 But Will Smith is in this moment where

445
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,340
 he's on the brink of homelessness.

446
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,220
 And he has this job interview coming up.

447
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,100
 And the day before his job interview,

448
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,020
 he's painting his apartment at home.

449
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,300
 The cops come to the door and they arrest him

450
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,660
 because he's failed to pay some parking tickets because he

451
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,020
 doesn't have money to pay it.

452
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,860
 And so he spends the night in jail.

453
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,580
 And he gets out of jail just in time for his job interview.

454
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,580
 So he shows up to this company.

455
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,420
 And he's wearing jeans he painted in,

456
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,340
 this tank top undershirt that's got paint on it.

457
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,300
 And you see him trying to tuck it in with paint on his shirt.

458
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,000
 And his hair's all messed up.

459
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,700
 And he's walking into this meeting

460
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,460
 with the C-suite executives of this company.

461
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,460
 And he's just trying to put himself together,

462
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,460
 even though he looks awful.

463
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,980
 And he sits down in front of these guys

464
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,380
 in very, very expensive suits.

465
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,460
 And he begins to try and explain to them why they

466
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,180
 should take a chance on him.

467
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,700
 And the main guy, who looks like the CEO of the company,

468
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,320
 looks at him and he's like, hey, look,

469
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,660
 what would you say to someone who walked in

470
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,460
 wearing what you're wearing?

471
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,260
 And the implication is, we don't give job offers

472
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,740
 to people who show up and present themselves like this.

473
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,380
 And yet Jesus would bust into that C-suite meeting

474
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,180
 and say, that's exactly the type of people I want.

475
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,220
 In fact, I only give offers and proposals to people like that.

476
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,940
 The people who don't have it together,

477
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,100
 the people whose lives are barely holding together,

478
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,220
 the people who are so worn out, exhausted,

479
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,220
 those who have been shackled in prison spiritually,

480
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,300
 bound up in sin, those are the people I came for.

481
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 Those are the people that I want to do life now

482
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,180
 and all of eternity with.

483
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,220
 So he says, come to me.

484
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,100
 All who labor and are heavy laden.

485
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,360
 And then he clarifies exactly what he's offering.

486
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,820
 What does he say?

487
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,860
 And I will give you rest.

488
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,780
 He says the exact same thing in the next line.

489
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,320
 He promises rest two times in two verses.

490
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,100
 My high school Bible study leader,

491
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,980
 if we were studying this passage together,

492
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,580
 he would have instructed me to write the two letters BP

493
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,320
 next to those verses, standing for Bible promise.

494
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,240
 Because what he wanted us to do

495
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,940
 was to identify the times in the Bible

496
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,160
 where God gives something that we can count on and bank on.

497
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,720
 There's no maybe or possibly to this.

498
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,060
 There's no uncertainty.

499
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
 You can count on this.

500
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:54,060
 You come to Jesus and he gives you rest.

501
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,560
 That's what he wants to offer you tonight.

502
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,120
 He wants to offer you rest.

503
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,060
 Anyone here just need a break in life right now?

504
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,660
 Anyone honest enough to just say,

505
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,340
 yeah, rest sounds pretty great.

506
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,100
 So what's Jesus gonna do?

507
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,320
 Is he gonna somehow like give my boss a nightmare

508
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,140
 that calls him to move my PTO from 10 days to 15 days?

509
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,540
 Is that how Jesus works?

510
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,280
 'Cause if so, I'm in, like count me in.

511
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,980
 That's how this Jesus thing works, I'll take it.

512
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,940
 It's not what we're talking about.

513
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,960
 When Jesus promises rest, there's two facets to it.

514
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,820
 He's talking about rest one day

515
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,840
 and then he's talking about rest today.

516
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,200
 When he talks about giving rest,

517
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,880
 he's talking about giving rest one day,

518
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,200
 which when I talk about that,

519
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,640
 I'm talking about life for all of eternity

520
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,480
 in heaven with Jesus.

521
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,180
 It's kind of a Revelation 21 type thing.

522
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,280
 If you've never read Revelation 21,

523
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,520
 I would encourage you to go read it

524
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,220
 because a day is coming for those who know Jesus

525
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,560
 where all of the struggle of life

526
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,540
 will come to a complete conclusion.

527
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,720
 There will be no more pain, no more death,

528
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,120
 no more battle against sin, no more tears

529
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,560
 because Jesus Christ is gonna make everything new.

530
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,840
 He's gonna make things exactly how they should be,

531
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,320
 including you.

532
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,120
 There'll be complete rest.

533
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,180
 But when he offers rest in his proposal,

534
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,040
 he's not just talking about rest one day,

535
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,300
 he's talking about rest today.

536
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,300
 But Jesus isn't telling us

537
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,920
 that we need to stop working altogether

538
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,260
 and just take a long nap.

539
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,260
 What he's not talking about is ceasing from our work

540
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,540
 in order to rest.

541
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,460
 What he's talking about when he offers rest

542
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,400
 is he's talking about bringing refreshment

543
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,220
 in the midst of the struggle.

544
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,380
 So I'll explain it this way.

545
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,620
 Just a few months ago, I started going to CrossFit.

546
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,460
 And I know what you're thinking.

547
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,300
 Really?

548
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,180
 You, you sure?

549
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,580
 'Cause I'm seeing you in high definition right now.

550
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,780
 And I don't see much fit to that cross.

551
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,980
 But anyway, started going to CrossFit.

552
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,660
 In the last three months, I have been pushed harder

553
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,760
 than I've ever been pushed before,

554
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,060
 which means I have experienced despair

555
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,140
 more than I've ever experienced before.

556
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,460
 There have been some workouts that I'm in

557
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,260
 that I just five minutes in, I'm like, I am done.

558
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,900
 Like I am literally, I'm done with this.

559
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,880
 And so I'm just trying to make it.

560
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,820
 But then something will happen in the midst of the workout

561
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,580
 where I'm exhausted, I am worn out,

562
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,820
 I have given up, I'm ready to be done with this thing.

563
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,860
 And then I will remember the breakfast

564
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,460
 that I'm earning from this workout.

565
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,100
 And I begin to picture that banana granola crunch pancake

566
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,220
 from first watch that I just might get to experience.

567
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,500
 And something happens in that moment,

568
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,300
 it unlocks these reserve tanks of energy.

569
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,540
 And I began to work out with purpose again.

570
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,480
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm actually crushing this WOD

571
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,620
 right now, workout of the day, by the way.

572
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,460
 So, and I think that's like a hint

573
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,980
 of what Jesus is talking about.

574
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,940
 He's like, look, I'm not telling you,

575
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,120
 you just get to like take a indefinite vacation

576
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,960
 from your job.

577
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,020
 What I'm talking about is I'm talking about refreshing you

578
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,900
 in the midst of the struggle.

579
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,940
 So think about it this way,

580
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,860
 in regard to your losing battle against sin.

581
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,800
 And I would imagine that's hundreds,

582
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,840
 if not over a thousand people in this room

583
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,160
 who might feel like you are losing the battle

584
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,380
 against some sin in your life.

585
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,480
 What if Jesus brought you here tonight

586
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,820
 just so that he could remind you

587
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,280
 that he hasn't given up on you, that he wants you,

588
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,440
 that your sin isn't the truest thing about you,

589
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,100
 that he isn't mad at you.

590
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,320
 And his goal is to keep forgiving you.

591
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,280
 And he wants to continue to give you a new start

592
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
 every morning.

593
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,080
 And he's committed to resourcing you

594
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,440
 with everything you need for victory.

595
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,080
 Like every day he's giving you the assurance

596
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,360
 that the victory over your sin has already been secured

597
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,480
 through his death, burial and resurrection.

598
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,240
 And not just that, he actually,

599
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,880
 when you put your faith in Jesus,

600
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,440
 he puts his Holy Spirit in you,

601
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,240
 which you might not realize this,

602
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,720
 but if God lives in you by the presence of the Holy Spirit,

603
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,200
 then you actually have the same power living in you

604
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,240
 that raised Christ from the dead.

605
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,640
 But not just that, he's given you his word

606
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,300
 so that you can know his ways and walk in his will.

607
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,840
 But not just that, he's gonna surround you

608
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,000
 with his people who will fight for you.

609
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,660
 And so maybe he brought you here tonight

610
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,040
 just to remind you, you aren't fighting alone.

611
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,680
 If you find yourself in a place where you feel hopeless,

612
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,920
 I think Jesus brought you here tonight to just say,

613
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,880
 "Hey, hope isn't lost."

614
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,480
 Like I'm still with you, I'm still for you,

615
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,840
 I still love you, I haven't given up on you,

616
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,460
 I'm not mad at you, but I hate your sin.

617
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,520
 And I'm so committed to you

618
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,920
 that I'm not leaving until we deal with this.

619
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,380
 My hope is that for some of you,

620
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,240
 that just unlocks some refreshment.

621
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,720
 Like you just for a moment believed,

622
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,920
 maybe all hope isn't lost.

623
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,020
 Or maybe in regard to that feeling that you're a failure

624
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,000
 because you're not doing enough or crushing life enough,

625
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,960
 or you haven't achieved enough,

626
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,360
 and it's all on you to make it happen.

627
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,840
 Maybe Jesus brought you here tonight to just say,

628
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,080
 "You don't have to crush all of life.

629
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,500
 "In fact, you never will because you're not me.

630
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,780
 "You're not God, and that's okay.

631
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,980
 "You don't have to crush life because Jesus already has."

632
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,860
 What do I mean by that?

633
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,420
 I mean, Jesus crushed life.

634
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,640
 He lived a perfect life.

635
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,240
 In fact, he's the only one who ever lived a perfect life.

636
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,700
 But he didn't just crush life, he crushed death.

637
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,760
 For you and for me.

638
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,620
 And he walked out of the grave

639
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,000
 to give you hope that you can as well.

640
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,040
 And so I tell you that just to say,

641
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,920
 maybe for some of you that refreshment

642
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,660
 comes in the form of you believing

643
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,040
 that your insufficiencies are actually a gift

644
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,700
 because they remind you of your need for Jesus,

645
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,860
 and God's power is actually perfected in your weakness.

646
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:55,820
 Maybe in your exhaustion from trying to please others,

647
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,900
 maybe Jesus brought you here tonight to just say,

648
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,300
 "I'm already pleased with you."

649
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,240
 Not because of what you're doing for me,

650
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,040
 but because of what I get to do in you.

651
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,800
 So some of you are here tonight,

652
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,000
 and you don't feel like anyone is choosing you.

653
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,340
 Like you are spinning your wheels,

654
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,800
 just longing and insecurity for someone to look at you

655
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 and to want you and to choose you.

656
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,280
 And Jesus is like, "I already chose you.

657
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,060
 "Come to me.

658
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,240
 "I choose you, I want you.

659
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,280
 "I wanna be with you now and for all of eternity.

660
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,660
 "And so I don't need you to be somebody

661
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,460
 "that everyone wants you to be.

662
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,200
 "I want you to be who I am making you to be."

663
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,760
 And so maybe you can just lean into that and enjoy that

664
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,700
 and live with this appreciation

665
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,760
 that Jesus Christ has chose you,

666
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,600
 he's with you, he's working in you.

667
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,780
 I promise you the life you're longing for

668
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,740
 is only found in Jesus.

669
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,860
 This is how great his proposal is.

670
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,080
 Like if you wanna talk about the lengths Jesus has gone to

671
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,240
 to invite you into relationship with him,

672
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,060
 the eternal son of God left heaven,

673
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,440
 was born to a virgin, grew up perfectly,

674
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,660
 lived the life that not one of us could live,

675
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,280
 went to the cross to do what?

676
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,480
 To take our punishment.

677
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,600
 The wrath of God was poured out on him

678
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,360
 so that it wouldn't be poured out on us.

679
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,140
 And then he rose from the grave victoriously demonstrating

680
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,020
 that you and I don't have to live in slavery

681
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,180
 to our sin for all of eternity.

682
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,060
 We can live as free children of God

683
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,700
 because of the blood of Jesus Christ, amen?

684
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,240
 So that's his invitation to us.

685
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,820
 Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden

686
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,300
 and I'll give you rest.

687
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,160
 That's the first aspect of the proposal.

688
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,920
 It's his invitation.

689
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,100
 But there's two aspects.

690
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,620
 Just like I proposed to Kat, Kat had to respond.

691
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,340
 When we were sitting in that rowboat

692
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,260
 in the middle of the Mooses Lake, Kat had two options,

693
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,400
 yes or no.

694
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,460
 And one would be a joyful row back to shore

695
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,900
 and the other one would be super awkward.

696
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,580
 But she had to respond and she responded with the word yes.

697
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,500
 And then all of her actions followed that response.

698
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,580
 She began planning a wedding.

699
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,340
 I say she because the best thing for me to do

700
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,900
 was to stay out of the way.

701
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,460
 She began to prepare to move to Austin.

702
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,580
 She didn't say yes to any date with any other guy.

703
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:52,580
 And I tell you that just to say like Jesus' proposal to us

704
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,620
 deserves a certain response.

705
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,460
 And Jesus spells out what that response is in verse 29.

706
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,540
 This is our response.

707
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,380
 Look at what he says.

708
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,860
 He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me

709
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,660
 "for I am gentle and lowly in heart

710
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,300
 "and you will find rest for your souls."

711
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,260
 So he starts out and he says, "Take my yoke upon you."

712
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,100
 That's weird language.

713
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,920
 What's a yoke?

714
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,880
 Yoke is that piece of farming equipment.

715
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,660
 It's that bar that's put over an oxen's neck

716
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,140
 to lead and guide and direct the oxen

717
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,260
 when working the field.

718
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,620
 Jesus is saying, "Yeah, yeah, like that."

719
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,900
 "Take my yoke upon you."

720
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
 What I wanna do in your life,

721
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,860
 I don't wanna just be your ticket into heaven.

722
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,220
 I wanna be your leader.

723
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,660
 I wanna be your guide.

724
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,880
 I wanna be the one that helps you move through

725
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,020
 every moment of every day.

726
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
 But not just that.

727
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,540
 In the Bible, the word yoke is used in different ways.

728
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,540
 Yoke is also a reference to a servant

729
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,540
 to someone who enters servitude from being conquered.

730
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:02,460
 So it is somebody who has been conquered

731
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,100
 that then lives in submission to a king as a servant.

732
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,100
 And Jesus is like, "Look, an aspect of discipleship

733
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,840
 "requires waving the white flag of surrender and submission.

734
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,600
 "An aspect of your relationship with Jesus

735
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,540
 "has to be Jesus conquering you in the sweetest of ways.

736
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,460
 "It is you coming to a place where you're like,

737
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,260
 "I'm done living for myself.

738
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,220
 "I'm done living under the rule and reign of sin,

739
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,360
 "which is leading me towards death.

740
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,000
 "Jesus, I surrender to you.

741
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,020
 "I wave the white flag because you, Jesus,

742
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,180
 "are the King of kings and the Lord of lords.

743
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,520
 "You are the one and only one

744
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,800
 "who has conquered sin and death."

745
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,060
 And so I tell you that just to say,

746
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,340
 is that your understanding of Christianity?

747
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,640
 Is that the relationship with Jesus that you have?

748
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,460
 Because I think our tendency is to believe

749
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,500
 that there's different subscription levels to Christianity.

750
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,220
 It's kind of like this, a while back,

751
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,620
 without telling anyone in my family,

752
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,580
 I just straight up canceled Netflix.

753
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,060
 And the response from my family was a mutiny.

754
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,460
 Like they rose up in rebellion.

755
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,080
 Like they shook their fists at me.

756
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,540
 It was crazy.

757
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,380
 And so what did I do?

758
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,440
 I was like, I guess we're getting Netflix back.

759
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,980
 I canceled it to save money, but I was like,

760
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,140
 I won't be staying in this house much longer

761
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,980
 if I don't get Netflix back.

762
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,100
 And so I got online and I began to research,

763
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,920
 like, well, are there options?

764
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,900
 And I found out you can get Netflix for cheap.

765
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,380
 Now the video quality,

766
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,580
 you're not gonna be able to discern the faces

767
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,120
 and the ads are gonna be just as long as the show itself,

768
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,780
 but you can get it on the cheap.

769
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,380
 But if you want better quality and no ads,

770
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,600
 it's a different subscription level.

771
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,860
 And sometimes I think that's how we treat Jesus

772
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,820
 in Christianity.

773
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,720
 Some of us, we just want the base subscription.

774
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,940
 We just want the base subscription.

775
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,220
 Look, Jesus, all I'm looking for is heaven.

776
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,280
 Okay, well, that's just gonna cost you a prayer.

777
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,220
 Okay, you just pray the prayer and you'll get into heaven.

778
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,060
 That's fine.

779
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,880
 It's like, great, that's all I need.

780
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,720
 Thank you so much.

781
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,740
 I want the cheap version, that'll work.

782
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,500
 But some of you are like, no, I'll take the silver package

783
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,360
 because I don't want just heaven, I want some of the feels.

784
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,140
 You know, like I wanna be able to show up to church.

785
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,820
 I wanna leave feeling better about myself.

786
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,300
 There's gonna be times in my life

787
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
 where I just need some grounding in life.

788
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,060
 So I'll take the silver package.

789
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,280
 Okay, well, that's gonna cost you a little bit more.

790
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,020
 It's gonna cost you more than a prayer.

791
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,140
 You are gonna need to show up to church some more.

792
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,220
 And you're like, okay, that's fine.

793
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,700
 I can do that.

794
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,920
 But then there's the platinum package.

795
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,660
 Okay, and that one's gonna cost you the most.

796
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,220
 But you know what?

797
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,560
 You subscribe to the platinum package,

798
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,180
 you're not just gonna get heaven.

799
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,900
 You're not gonna just get the feels,

800
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,680
 but you're gonna get these amazing God stories in life.

801
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,380
 But it's gonna cost you full surrender.

802
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,580
 Full surrender to Jesus.

803
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,100
 The platinum package is the package.

804
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,940
 The platinum package is the package.

805
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,940
 Jesus invites you to full surrender,

806
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,260
 not to take something from you,

807
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,420
 but so that he can give you all of himself.

808
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,420
 And you will not be fully satisfied

809
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,460
 until you receive as much of him

810
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,960
 that he's willing to give you.

811
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,860
 So I just wanna encourage you to evaluate

812
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,600
 what's keeping you from surrendering to Jesus?

813
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,360
 What's keeping you in a place where you're believing

814
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,400
 that the base package or the silver package

815
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,220
 is still a real option?

816
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,440
 When Jesus is explicitly saying,

817
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,440
 "Take my yoke upon you, wave the white flag."

818
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,540
 But not just that, he says,

819
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,760
 "Take my yoke upon you," and watch the next words.

820
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,240
 He says, "And learn from me."

821
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,760
 Okay, well, that's important.

822
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,800
 Because you have to decide,

823
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 is Jesus gonna be a source of wisdom or the source of life?

824
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,520
 You know what's interesting is the first person

825
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,920
 to tell you something becomes the authority on that thing.

826
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,760
 You realize that?

827
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,800
 I see this in my kids.

828
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,680
 Like most recently, one of my kids has come home

829
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,440
 and been like, "Did you know that Chuck E. Cheese

830
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,160
 "recycles their pizza?"

831
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,840
 Yeah, this kid at school told me that.

832
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,520
 I was like, "Well, he must be the authority

833
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,640
 "on pizza from Chuck E. Cheese."

834
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,540
 And like you can Google it and Chuck E. Cheese

835
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,640
 has clarified that they don't in fact recycle their pizza.

836
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,880
 But like we've gotta unlearn some stuff.

837
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,220
 Because if we're not careful,

838
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,180
 like we're gonna listen to a bunch of different voices

839
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,900
 in our life and our tendency is going to be,

840
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,100
 "Well, they said it, so it must be true."

841
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
 But what Jesus is saying is,

842
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,080
 "Look, when you come under my yoke, you know what?

843
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,920
 "I become your final authority.

844
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,300
 "Learn from me."

845
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,100
 So the question you need to answer is,

846
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,740
 are you willing to be instructed by Jesus?

847
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,460
 Like are you willing to learn all of life from him?

848
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,480
 Because I need to warn you, what is wise to Jesus

849
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,500
 will seem foolish to the world.

850
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,160
 Are you willing to learn from him?

851
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,700
 From his word?

852
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,740
 And I would imagine that some of you are sitting there

853
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,900
 like, "Why should I?"

854
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,180
 Like what gives him more right to speak into my life

855
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,260
 than anyone or anything else?

856
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,500
 Well, I hope the case I'm building for you

857
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,520
 is that the eternal son of God became a human,

858
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,600
 that God himself took on flesh.

859
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,360
 And Jesus tells us exactly what he is like.

860
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,500
 So don't miss this because here's the thing,

861
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,180
 you're not gonna want life with Jesus

862
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,680
 unless you're responding to the right Jesus.

863
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,900
 You have to realize that your view of Jesus

864
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,620
 is gonna determine how you respond to Jesus.

865
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,500
 Jesus says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me."

866
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,340
 Why?

867
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,340
 "For I am gentle and lowly in heart,

868
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,700
 "and you will find rest for your souls."

869
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,100
 He says, "I'm gentle and lowly in heart."

870
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,780
 So what you have to understand is in the Bible,

871
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,640
 when the Bible talks about the heart,

872
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,860
 it's talking about the control center of someone's being.

873
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,020
 It's what makes you you, it's what drives you

874
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,460
 and directs you, it's what gets you out of bed

875
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,340
 in the morning.

876
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,540
 And Jesus is just saying,

877
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,660
 "Look, you need to know I'm gentle."

878
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,940
 A guy named Dane Ortlund,

879
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,260
 he wrote an entire book on these two words.

880
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,420
 It's called "Gentle and Lowly."

881
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,660
 And he does an incredible job of helping us understand

882
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,100
 what Jesus is saying when he says he's gentle and lowly.

883
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,900
 In regards to Jesus being gentle,

884
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,340
 Dane Ortlund says, "Jesus is not trigger happy.

885
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:04,340
 "He's not harsh or reactionary or easily exasperated.

886
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:10,140
 "He's the most understanding person in the universe.

887
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:15,140
 "The posture most natural to him.

888
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,420
 "It's not a pointed finger, but open arms."

889
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,180
 Is that your understanding of Jesus?

890
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,140
 But he's not just gentle, he's lonely.

891
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,120
 He's not lonely, he's lowly.

892
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,340
 Dane Ortlund explains it this way.

893
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,740
 He says, "The point in saying that Jesus is lowly

894
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,580
 "is that he's accessible.

895
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,140
 "For all his resplendent glory and dazzling holiness,

896
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,820
 "his supreme uniqueness and otherness,

897
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,820
 "no one in human history has ever been more approachable

898
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,540
 "than Jesus."

899
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,460
 And then he goes on and says, "This is who he is.

900
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,060
 "He's tender, he's open, he's welcoming,

901
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,620
 "he's accommodating.

902
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,900
 "He's understanding, he's willing."

903
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,500
 If we are asked to say only one thing about who Jesus is,

904
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,180
 we would be honoring Jesus's own teaching

905
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,720
 if our answer is he's gentle and lowly.

906
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,260
 As I was journaling through this passage yesterday,

907
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,140
 just to make sure that it had invaded my own heart,

908
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,400
 here's the things that I wrote to Jesus.

909
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,200
 I said, "You're gentle with the worst parts of me.

910
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,860
 "You have the most patience in the areas

911
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,820
 "where it would be easy to be impatient.

912
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,820
 "You make a holy, all-knowing, all-powerful God accessible.

913
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,660
 "You stoop low enough to be near to me."

914
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,300
 And Jesus finishes that section by just saying,

915
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,060
 "For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

916
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,980
 That word easy in the Greek, it means kind.

917
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,740
 He's saying, "My yoke that I place on you,

918
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,140
 "it's actually kind."

919
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,540
 Dane Orlin described it as like telling a drowning man

920
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,380
 that he must put on the burden of a life preserver.

921
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,020
 So here's what you need to understand.

922
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,700
 You're gonna be yoked to something.

923
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,780
 Don't you wanna be yoked to something kind?

924
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,780
 You just have to make sure that you've got the right Jesus.

925
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,100
 Several years ago, I knew this guy

926
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,520
 who's a worship leader, which meant he was giving

927
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,820
 the majority of his time to leading people to Jesus.

928
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,700
 And unfortunate for him, he had the same first

929
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,260
 and last name, same spelling as a political figure

930
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,380
 who was considered by many people to be racist

931
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,420
 and oppressive and extreme.

932
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:49,220
 So anytime this political figure would do something

933
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,640
 that would catch fire in the news that seemed racist

934
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,660
 or oppressive or extreme, this worship leader

935
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,360
 would get blown up on social media.

936
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,780
 So people at the time, it was tweeting at him.

937
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,700
 They would tweet like horrific things at him.

938
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,980
 And so he would have to post something that was like,

939
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,980
 "You've got the wrong guy."

940
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,040
 Two people can have the same name, you know.

941
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,460
 Like, "You got the wrong guy, that's not me."

942
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,880
 And I just wonder if there are times Jesus is looking

943
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,120
 at us like, "You got the wrong guy."

944
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,700
 Some of us are like, "You know what?

945
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,300
 "Jesus is irrelevant and incompetent

946
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,620
 "and boring and unsatisfying."

947
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,800
 And I wonder if Jesus is like, "Dude, you got the wrong guy.

948
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,140
 "That's not me."

949
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,960
 Being a Christian is exhausting.

950
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,520
 It's impossible to have a job and do everything

951
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,120
 for Jesus that he wants me doing for him.

952
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,080
 I wonder if Jesus is like, "That's not me.

953
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,400
 "You've got the wrong Jesus.

954
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,520
 "Man, Jesus is disappointed in me.

955
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,260
 "He's close to giving up on me.

956
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,120
 "I think he just tolerates me.

957
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,960
 "You've got the wrong Jesus.

958
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,520
 "You've got the wrong guy."

959
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:16,340
 Jesus Christ is responsible for the greatest proposal

960
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,400
 in all of history.

961
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,440
 "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden,

962
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,540
 "and I will give you rest.

963
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,280
 "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,

964
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,160
 "for I am gentle and lowly in heart,

965
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,440
 "and you will find rest for your souls,

966
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,920
 "for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

967
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,600
 So how do you respond to a message like this?

968
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,120
 Some of you, let me just invite you to repent

969
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,260
 of a low view of Jesus tonight.

970
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,760
 Maybe for you, it's not racing out of here,

971
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,040
 and when we go to sing a song,

972
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,400
 you just get on your knees or you get before the Lord

973
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,840
 and you just say, "I've had the wrong Jesus.

974
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,760
 "Would you forgive me, Jesus?

975
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,960
 "I repent of a low view of you."

976
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,320
 Maybe for some of you,

977
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,360
 you just need to declare your love for him.

978
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,380
 Like, that's gonna be a great moment to just be like,

979
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,280
 "Thank you for your proposal to me.

980
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,340
 "The answer is yes, and I love you back.

981
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,600
 "Thank you, Jesus, for all that you are.

982
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,420
 "Thank you for my salvation.

983
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,760
 "Thank you that you are gentle with me.

984
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,120
 "Thank you that you are accessible to me.

985
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,880
 "You're holy, holy, holy,

986
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,580
 "and yet you want to be with me now and for all of eternity."

987
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,680
 Maybe for some of you,

988
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,120
 your response is to just start learning from him.

989
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,940
 It's to start reading his word, to learn from him.

990
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,760
 And yet some of you, you're gonna say yes

991
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,820
 to Jesus's proposal for the first time.

992
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,240
 You know what's interesting

993
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,720
 is when I was telling my proposal story,

994
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,280
 I guarantee there was at least one person in this room

995
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,120
 who was like, "There's no way that's true."

996
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,840
 Like, some of you are like, "I bet he's embellishing.

997
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,780
 "Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

998
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,820
 "I'm lying to you to get you to like me on a church stage."

999
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:03,180
 Everything I said is 100% true.

1000
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,840
 And yet something in you hears the links

1001
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,040
 that I went to for a cat,

1002
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,980
 and you're like, "There's no way that happened.

1003
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,340
 "There's no way."

1004
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,620
 And my hope is that some of you

1005
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,860
 might be having that type of realization,

1006
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,260
 which is there's no way.

1007
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:24,260
 There's no way that the God of the universe would want me.

1008
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,020
 If he knew where I've been, if he knew what I've done,

1009
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,340
 you're telling me that God put on flesh

1010
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,340
 and gave his life, he died to have me.

1011
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,440
 It's 100% true.

1012
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,240
 And the invitation to you tonight is to come.

1013
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,280
 Let's pray together.

1014
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,460
 If that's you,

1015
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,400
 if you're realizing for the first time

1016
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,860
 that Jesus Christ is inviting you to come to him,

1017
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:08,040
 if he's inviting you to be forgiven by him,

1018
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,720
 to be satisfied in him, to find your hope in him,

1019
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,180
 to find your strength and your peace and life in him,

1020
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:20,440
 he's inviting you to surrender to him,

1021
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,560
 to be led by him,

1022
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,400
 and spend all of eternity with him.

1023
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,920
 If that's you and you just wanna say yes to Jesus,

1024
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,080
 I invite you right now in the quietness of your own heart

1025
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,160
 to just say that, say, "Jesus, yes.

1026
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,440
 "Yes, would you come into my life tonight?

1027
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,440
 "Would you save me from my sins tonight?

1028
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,240
 "I surrender my life to you tonight."

1029
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:54,760
 And then for everyone else,

1030
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,080
 would you respond to the Lord,

1031
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,480
 whether it's repenting from a low view

1032
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,060
 or just declaring your love for him

1033
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,800
 or just beginning to learn from him?

1034
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,700
 Do business with the Lord right now, Jesus, we thank you.

1035
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,640
 That you invite us to come, that you want us.

1036
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,500
 God, would you,

1037
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,760
 would you draw us close to you?

1038
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,760
 Would you give us eyes to see just how sweet you really are?

1039
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:32,640
 Thank you, Jesus, that you are gentle and lovely.

1040
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,280
 Amen.
