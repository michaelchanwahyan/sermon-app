[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:27.940]   - What's up guys?
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.780]   How we doing?
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.600]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.440]   Come on.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.760]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.240]   It's good to be with you guys here in Dallas, Fort Worth.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.580]   We're glad you're tuning in and those listening around.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.260]   I'm gonna start with a reading from the scriptures,
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.640]   if you will, the Jesus Storybook Bible.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.160]   Have you ever needed just to be reminded that God loves you?
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.280]   Yeah, good.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.860]   And so, there was this time, there was this week,
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.000]   there was a tough week.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.220]   I was teaching on a Sunday.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.760]   I was looking for an illustration, I couldn't find it.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.840]   I was beginning to get angry with God
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.960]   that he wouldn't give it to me.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.840]   This is kind of like if you're in sales, you know,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.120]   and you're not getting the deal,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.280]   or if things aren't going your way at work as a preacher,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.760]   you know, it's like, God, I need this illustration.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.020]   And it's Saturday evening and I don't have it yet.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.360]   And so, I'm tucking my girls, Presley and Finley, in bed
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.320]   and I'm reading them a story from here, but I'm distracted.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.300]   If I'm honest with you, to be transparent,
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.740]   in the moment I was really distracted,
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.820]   my mind was just spinning like,
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.980]   God, I need this illustration, I need this illustration.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.820]   So, I'm reading this and we're just moving
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.280]   through the Jesus Storybook Bible we had just started over.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.900]   And so, I'm in Genesis six through nine.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.580]   It says, "Time passed and many people filled the earth.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.760]   "Everyone everywhere had forgotten about God
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.160]   "and were only doing bad things all the time.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.780]   "God's heart was filled with pain
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.200]   "when he saw what had happened to the world he loved.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   "Everywhere was disease and death and destruction,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.360]   "all the things God hates most.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.180]   "Now, Noah was God's friend, which was odd in those days
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.240]   "because no one else was.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.480]   "Noah listened to God, he talked to God.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.860]   "He just loved being with God
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.120]   "like you do with your best friend.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.360]   "Noah, God said, things have gone wrong.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.260]   "People have filled my world with hate instead of love.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.400]   "They are destroying themselves and each other and my world.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.960]   "I must stop them.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.480]   "First, we'll build an ark."
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420]   And I'll tell you the story tonight,
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.740]   so I'll jump to the end.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.080]   Here's the punchline.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.160]   It says, "And there in the clouds,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.940]   "just where the storm meets the sun
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.380]   "was a beautiful bow made of light.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.220]   "It was a new beginning in God's world.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.120]   "It wasn't long before everything went wrong again,
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.520]   "but God wasn't surprised.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.600]   "He knew this would happen.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.320]   "That's why before the beginning of time,
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.280]   "he had another plan, a better plan,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.880]   "a plan not to destroy the world, but to rescue it.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.860]   "A plan to one day send his own son, the rescuer."
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.680]   I said, "Good night, Presley.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.660]   "Good night, Finley.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.120]   "Daddy loves you."
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.140]   I walked out of their room.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.140]   I said, "God, have you forgotten about me?
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.560]   "I mean, you know what I gotta do tomorrow, right?"
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.700]   And I walked from their room to set something in the kitchen
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.900]   and I looked out the window
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.600]   and I saw all of my neighbors gathering in the street,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.520]   which is weird.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.500]   Everybody kind of coming out of their houses
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   and gathering in the street
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.840]   and I set something down in the kitchen.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.700]   I went to the front door and I went outside
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.580]   and I went in the street to see what the commotion was.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.820]   Hey guys, what are y'all doing?
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.420]   And they pointed and I looked
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.100]   and in the sky was this incredible rainbow.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.820]   I mean, a whole rainbow stretching from the east to the west
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.280]   and God said, "No, I hadn't forgotten about you, dude.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.060]   "I hadn't forgotten about you, bro."
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.160]   And it was more than ironic.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.200]   It was one of those moments in my life.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.020]   In fact, that's what I opened with the next day
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.860]   was that story.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.480]   That was the illustration that I needed
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.620]   and it's crazy, right?
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.340]   This symbol of God's promise that we've forgotten,
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.580]   that we've watered down and give other meanings to.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.240]   This incredible rainbow that hangs in the sky
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.260]   is God's promise that he will not destroy the world again.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.880]   As we sat in here last week,
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.560]   you remember at the end of the message,
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.640]   it was pouring down rain.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.040]   I even made mention of that.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.080]   Well, in Fort Worth, this is what they saw
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.280]   over the Ridgely Theater.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.720]   There's hundreds of young adults
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.520]   gathered in Fort Worth right now.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.020]   But last week, this was a picture
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.220]   that one of the folks there had taken
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.800]   because it had rained there as well
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.520]   and there was this promise from God
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.000]   that he will not destroy the world again.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And isn't it ironic
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.720]   that we take this old man with a beard and a staff
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.320]   standing outside a giant boat
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.800]   and animals gathered two by two
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.180]   and we paint murals on nursery walls
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.760]   and we say things to kids like,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.640]   "Hey, tonight I've got a story for you.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.340]   "It's about when God regretted making humans
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.000]   "and killed everyone."
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.160]   And then we're gonna go to bed, sleep tight, you know?
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.220]   It's crazy.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.660]   This story is crazy what it means
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.720]   and that it happened.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.760]   And the truth that it teaches us,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.400]   see, Noah had neighbors, he had friends,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.320]   he had people he worked with,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.460]   and they all died.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.540]   And they all faced God's judgment.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.140]   And you and I sit in the same reality.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.080]   We have friends and family
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.060]   and people we work with.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.480]   And they're all going to die.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.040]   And they will all face the same judgment.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.880]   And God will judge the world again, not by flood,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.940]   says in 2 Peter, but by fire this time.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.000]   That's a sobering reality.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.760]   And so this story tonight,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.820]   we're talking about Noah and the ark
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.800]   and a reminder of God's promises.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   This story has this incredible truth
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.520]   that we need to learn from this evening.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.480]   We need to be reminded why God preserved this story
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.440]   in Scripture and how important it is for us
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.840]   because God's judgment is real.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.920]   So as we travel through this story,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.680]   we're just gonna look at the evidence of Noah's story,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.080]   the significance of Noah's story.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.060]   And before you leave here, the application of Noah's story,
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.400]   if you're just joining us this evening,
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.720]   we're moving through a series called BC,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.760]   which stands for before Christ.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.560]   We now count 2016 years from the birth
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.940]   of a man named Jesus.
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.560]   Every atheist you know dates their checks.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.880]   2016 years from his birth, he reset the calendar.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.560]   The Bible is divided into two parts,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.040]   the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.480]   So we are traveling through the Old Testament
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   in this series called BC.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.960]   Tonight, we're looking at Noah.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.120]   Last week, we looked at the creation of humanity,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   Adam and Eve, the fall, sin entered the world.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.520]   Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Abel.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.440]   Because the world was fractured with sin,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.000]   Cain kills Abel out of jealousy.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.440]   He kills his brother.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.520]   We see the wickedness and sin spread.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.920]   Abel is replaced by a son named Seth.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.140]   The name Seth means in place of.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.560]   And we begin to see the substitutionary atonement
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.080]   of Jesus Christ from Genesis 3 on into the story
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.040]   that Jesus would die in our place.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.300]   And then from Seth, ultimately came Christ
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.000]   by way of a man named Noah.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.160]   A man named Noah.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.920]   I'll read to you from Genesis chapter six.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.540]   The story is told, chapters five through chapters nine.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.160]   Of course, we're gonna skip around some.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.680]   God looks down, he sees evil, and he's going to hit reset.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.640]   The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.340]   had become on the earth, and that every inclination
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.580]   of the thoughts of the human heart
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.880]   was only evil all the time.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.360]   The Lord regretted that he had made human beings
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.700]   Maybe the saddest verse in all of the 66 books of the Bible.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.280]   That God looked down and the Hebrews said he repented.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.880]   He wanted to turn away from.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.540]   The reason being 'cause he saw that man had turned
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.860]   not only on him, but on each other.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.240]   And that the world was a terrible place to live,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.960]   full of wickedness, hate, murder, and disease, and death.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.640]   So the Lord said, I will wipe from the face of the earth
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.080]   the human race I have created, and with them the animals,
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.400]   the birds, and the creatures that move along the ground.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.900]   For I regret that I have made them.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.560]   But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.080]   Where it says he found favor in the eyes of the Lord,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.600]   it's the Hebrew word hein.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.820]   It's the Hebrew word translated into Greek
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.000]   and then English, grace.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.740]   But Noah had God's grace rest upon him.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.280]   This is the account of Noah and his family.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.800]   Noah was a righteous man,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.660]   blameless among the people of his time.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.100]   And he walked faithfully with God.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.160]   Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160]   Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.880]   and was full of violence.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.440]   God saw how corrupt the earth had become,
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.300]   for all the people on the earth had corrupted their ways.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.960]   So God said to Noah, I am going to put an end to all people,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.920]   for the earth is filled with violence because of them.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.400]   I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.240]   So make yourself an ark of cypress wood.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.520]   Make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.880]   Then he goes into great detail
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.180]   of how specifically to make this ark.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.840]   Verse 18, but I will establish my covenant with you
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.840]   and you will enter the ark.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.800]   A covenant is a one-sided promise.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.620]   It's not a I promise if you.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.880]   It's a I will, period.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.120]   It's a till death do us part.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.440]   Sickness and in health, rich or poor,
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.900]   no matter what you do to me, I will.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.040]   But I will establish my covenant with you
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.360]   and you will enter the ark, you and your sons
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.020]   and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.000]   You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.480]   male and female, to keep them alive with you.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.640]   Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal,
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.440]   and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.500]   will come to you to be kept alive.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.120]   You are to let every kind of food that is to be eaten
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.080]   and store it away as food for you and for them.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.360]   And then it says this beautiful verse in verse 22.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.320]   Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.400]   Who was this man?
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.320]   Someone chosen by God out of grace
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.160]   who responded faithfully to that call.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.640]   When we were looking for a name of our son,
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.840]   who's now three, Weston one, that's his name,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.400]   but I wanted to name him Noah.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.140]   You see how much clout I have in my family.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.420]   I wanted to name him Noah.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.600]   And the reason I wanted to name him Noah
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.360]   is because this guy who stood all by himself in creation
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.440]   as everyone mocked him and everyone said, you're a weirdo.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.680]   What are you doing?
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.840]   Why are you doing that?
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.800]   I said, man, I'm just gonna faithfully follow God.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   And he did so alone.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.520]   You ever felt alone on this walk?
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.700]   You ever felt like you're the only Christian at work,
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.660]   the only Christian at school,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.960]   the only Christian on your street
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.480]   in your apartment complex?
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.800]   Noah was the only believer, follower of God on the planet.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.820]   On the planet.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.680]   Very, very alone.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.460]   The story is not about Noah though.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.920]   It's really about God's judgment.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.120]   Noah is a character in it.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.280]   The story is about God's faithfulness.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.680]   And yes, I'm going to tell you that God is loving
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.760]   from a story where he destroyed everyone.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.680]   I'm going to show you hopefully from the scriptures
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.840]   that this was a loving act from him
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.740]   because God did what he said he was going to do.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.860]   But Noah would have been crazy, right?
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.600]   This man would have been seen as a lunatic.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.360]   Could you imagine being his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.880]   You go to school, you get beat up because of your names.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.680]   And then you go home and your dad's building
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.560]   this big old ark, you know, a big boat in the front yard.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.240]   This would be the equivalent of your dad
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.560]   building a time machine on the front lawn.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.840]   You know, your friends are like,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.880]   hey, what's your dad doing?
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.000]   You're like, oh, you know, just building a time machine.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.240]   I don't know.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.920]   God told him to, you know.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.840]   This would be crazy, this man, right?
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.560]   Everybody would have thought he was absolutely insane.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.240]   And some people would think that you're insane
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.160]   for believing it.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.040]   Was it a local flood, a global flood?
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.240]   Did it really, you believe, Miley Cyrus said
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.960]   you would be effing crazy to believe that fairy tale?
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.420]   Well, no offense, Miley, but I'm gonna go with God over you,
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.080]   okay, if that's cool.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.780]   So let's look at the evidence of Noah's story, okay?
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.540]   ABC recently, not too long ago, did a special
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.240]   revealing new discovery and showing evidence of the flood.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.340]   And they always seem to be surprised.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.900]   They always take this approach like, yeah, well,
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.180]   it seems like this part of the Bible could actually be true.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.700]   And I'm like, yeah, well, that's because God wrote it.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.700]   And so it was not a local flood, but a worldwide flood.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.860]   I'm gonna give you some evidence of that.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.360]   In fact, chromosomal research, and this is a lot
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.300]   of crazy stuff, heady stuff that I can't go too deep in.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.460]   And so at nine o'clock tonight, I'm gonna tweet out
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.320]   several articles.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.440]   If you follow on Twitter, you can grab those.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.340]   You wanna go deeper into this, you can read those articles.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.340]   But it has been recently discovered that in recent history,
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.380]   within the past 10,000 years, probably about 3,500 years ago
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.840]   there was a bottleneck in humanity, okay?
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.520]   So much so that they have now discovered,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.100]   they've traced this back down to three women, okay?
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.060]   That three women were able to procreate life
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.380]   at some point in recent history about 3,500 years ago.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.300]   How about that, okay?
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.140]   Maybe Shem, Ham, and Japheth's wife,
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.580]   because we know Noah's wife didn't have any more children
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.260]   after the flood.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.100]   All around the world, there's evidence
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.060]   of a cataclysmic flood.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.580]   You may have thought that the Grand Canyon was formed
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.860]   by the Colorado River slowly cutting into it.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.060]   Some people still believe that, but a theory
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.740]   that is gaining credibility is that it was actually
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.460]   caused by a cataclysmic flood, not just the Grand Canyon,
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.740]   but also Devil's Tower in Wyoming, Monument Valley in Utah,
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.060]   and Bryce Canyon in Utah, okay?
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.680]   This is one of the leading theories out there right now
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   that, hey, these canyons were cut by rapid rushing water.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.780]   Biologists have found oceanic fossils on mountaintops.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.780]   Recently, they have found whales on the tops of mountains,
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.560]   nowhere near the ocean.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.400]   How did they get there?
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.500]   Let me tell you how they didn't get there.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.460]   Somebody wasn't like, well, my pet whale died.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.060]   Let me haul it up this mountain, right,
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.900]   and bury it, pet cemetery up here.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.660]   No, that's not what happened, okay?
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.700]   Think worldwide flood.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.760]   Many believe that a worldwide flood gives the Earth
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.080]   the appearance of age, that it's actually a young Earth,
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.440]   but scientists have said, well, if the Earth was
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.980]   at one point covered with water,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.360]   that could skew the results of carbon dating.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   Oh, I said that, biologists have found fossils
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.200]   on mountaintops.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.520]   There are over 150 global flood stories
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.360]   from ancient civilizations.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.320]   That include a man who was favored,
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.380]   who built a vessel to protect him and his family.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.080]   What this means is you go into the jungles of Brazil,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.440]   the jungles of Africa, and you meet
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   with Indian civilizations, and they tell you,
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.240]   or native civilizations, and they tell you,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.200]   hey, we, you know, our ancestors have told us this story
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.280]   over and over and over about a man
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.160]   when the Earth flooded and he was protected
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.780]   because he built a boat.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.020]   The flood would have changed everything.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.680]   The flood would have changed everything,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.220]   the climate, the atmosphere.
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.920]   I personally believe it had never rained prior to the flood.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.780]   I believe the Bible supports that.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.040]   The Bible says that there was this umbrella of water
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.120]   in the sky, that when God separated the water in the sky
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.760]   and the Earth, that there was this kind of ozone layer
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.040]   or this atmosphere that protected us
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.760]   from the sun's radiation.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.440]   I believe that's why that you see this fault line
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.240]   in the Bible that at one moment,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.520]   they lived like 1,000 years,
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.680]   and the next moment after the flood,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.800]   after it had rained for the first time,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.320]   people began to die younger and younger and younger
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.960]   and younger and younger.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.400]   All right?
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.320]   The atmosphere as we know it changed,
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.640]   the climate changed, the umbrella of water changed,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.280]   the waters burst forth from above and below,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.800]   the Scripture says.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.500]   And some people say, "Well, what about dinosaurs?
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.340]   "What about dinosaurs?
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.180]   "Were they on the Ark?"
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.860]   I don't know.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.960]   Maybe, maybe little ones, maybe eggs.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.840]   I don't know, but let me ask you a question.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.480]   Did you know, did you know that reptiles
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.640]   grow their entire lives?
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.720]   Different than mammals.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   Mammals hit a max height and then plateau or even decline.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.640]   Reptiles, they grow their entire existence.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.040]   This is one of the reasons they shed their skin.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.560]   And so if at this time,
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.960]   under this protected umbrella of an ozone layer,
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.280]   people and things live up to 1,000 years old,
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.080]   how big would an iguana be?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.560]   Did you know the first dinosaur they ever discovered,
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.840]   this was what was said about it.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.080]   It looked like a 30-foot long iguana.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.600]   You know what they named it?
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.800]   Creatively, Iguanodon.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.440]   Here's a picture of it.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.700]   Artist rendering of the first dinosaur they ever discovered.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.080]   Because if things lived thousands of years,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.200]   then snakes and iguanas and lizards and crocodiles
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.920]   would continue to grow for thousands of years.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.260]   They would be huge.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.880]   Where are dinosaurs today?
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.980]   Look at your pet iguana.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.800]   Let's talk about facts about the ark,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.000]   if you're still with me.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.020]   The ark would have been roughly 427 feet long.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.680]   That's about a football field and a half.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.860]   95 feet wide and 75 feet high.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.340]   You might be thinking, JP, that's awesome.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.180]   You know what?
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.020]   With all of these details,
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.500]   I'm gonna become a billionaire and build one.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.260]   You would not be the first person.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.280]   Lots of people have built arks, okay?
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.500]   I'll show you a few.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.500]   There's one.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.540]   There's another one.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.100]   There's another one and another one and yet one more.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.760]   This one specifically is traveling from Norway to Brazil.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.000]   These are made life-size.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.960]   You see that?
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.120]   That's a life-size giraffe there on top
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.720]   and an elephant as well.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.060]   Somebody spent millions and millions of dollars
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.080]   building an ark replica.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.180]   Okay, could it fit all of the animals?
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.760]   Miley Cyrus would tell you no.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.200]   There would need to be between 16 and 50,000 animals
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.300]   on this ark.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.780]   Between 16,000 and 50,000, that's a big discrepancy.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.700]   Let's go with the extremely high number of 50,000.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.660]   There would have been two of every kind, okay?
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.040]   Here's what that word means in the Hebrew
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.320]   where it says kind.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.520]   This word is very important.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.680]   What does it mean two of every kind?
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.080]   It means two kinds of dogs.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.400]   It doesn't mean two dachshunds and two Dobermans.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.040]   It means two dogs, okay?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.240]   Not a dachshund, two dachshunds and two wolves,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.680]   two dingoes, two coyotes.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.520]   No, just two kinds of dogs, not two species of dogs.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.040]   See, here's the way that you would define kind
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.920]   as it's defined here.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.920]   Animals that can procreate, okay?
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.840]   A horse and a cow cannot breed and make babies, okay?
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.180]   It's never happened.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:38.080]   But different species of cows can breed and have babies.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.320]   Different kinds of horses can breed and have babies, right?
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.360]   Different kinds of dogs, even a dachshund and a wolf
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.520]   can have babies, so every kind of dog comes from two.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.680]   This is important to understand this, right?
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.720]   And so the average size would have been a,
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.000]   ready for it, sheep.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.400]   90% of all the animals in the animal kingdom,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.120]   90% are smaller than a sheep.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.480]   So let's do some math real quick, if you're still with me.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.880]   240 sheep fit on a railroad livestock car.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.760]   That's how we transport them today.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.240]   So it would have taken 208 railroad cars
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.240]   to get 50,000 animals across the water, if you will, 208.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.660]   Could 208 railroad cars fit on the ark?
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.660]   No, 549 could have.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:39.300]   It would have only taken 36% of the ark,
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.680]   according to the size that it was built in the scripture,
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.480]   to hold two of every kind of animal.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.180]   And assuming that Noah worked 52 weeks of year,
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.860]   six days a week, taking one off for rest,
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.500]   experts calculate that he would need
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.500]   81 years to complete the ark.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.300]   He had 120 years and three sons,
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.020]   whose only chores were to build a giant boat.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.580]   And so you may ask, hey, how did the animals get there?
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.580]   How did Noah get all the animals on the boat?
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.420]   Here's how.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.600]   God brought 'em.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.760]   That's it.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.320]   Like if you wanna scrutinize something in the story,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.080]   all of those other things, I can logically get you there.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.600]   How did all the animals get there?
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.640]   God had to supernaturally intervene.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.800]   And if you got an issue with that,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.480]   let me tell you another story about a man who died,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.400]   lived in a grave for three days, and then rose from the dead.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.800]   And when I say lived in the grave,
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.100]   I don't mean lived in the grave, I mean dead in the grave
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.120]   for three days and then rose from the dead.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.840]   And so if you've got a problem with Noah,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.240]   you've got a problem with Jesus.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.080]   And so how did the animals get to the ark?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.200]   This is simple.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.080]   God brought them to him.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   It's the only way anybody gets to God.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   He grabs them and turns them and moves them to himself.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.320]   That's how you got here, man.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.680]   In the same way that you walked through those doors tonight,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   that's how those animals got on the ark.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.720]   God brought them.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.400]   I pray for you every week
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.080]   that he would bring everyone here,
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.240]   that he wants to be here.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.480]   So let's talk about the significance of Noah's story.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.020]   The significance of Noah's story.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.560]   God tells Noah to build an ark
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.420]   because he is going to destroy the world.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.280]   This is heavy.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.360]   It's not like a nursery mural, okay?
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.380]   Forget the animated man with a big smile on his face.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.160]   No, all his friends are about to die.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.320]   It's much more like the painting
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.680]   of a man named Gustav Dore called "The Deluge."
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.320]   I can't show it to you.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.780]   It's much too graphic.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.520]   Let me just describe it to you.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.320]   The floodwaters come up.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.360]   There's arms and legs flailing in the water
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.720]   as people drown.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.360]   And there's a man next to a giant boulder
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.780]   who hoist his three-year-old up onto a rock
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.900]   as his wife sits up there,
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.640]   as vultures who are tired from feasting
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.900]   on the flesh of humans circle above.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.760]   And on that rock, as this man chooses,
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.380]   do I let my child drown or possibly be devoured?
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.220]   On that rock is a giant tiger hovering above.
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.400]   That's the flood.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.140]   It ain't no nursery rhyme, man.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.340]   It's heavy.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.180]   It's heavy.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.340]   Gotta feel that.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.940]   And Noah obeys as others mock his obedience,
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.520]   as he's grieved at the horrible sounds
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.620]   of people screaming outside,
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.620]   the disgusting smell of rotted flesh floating all about.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.020]   Noah trusted God when no one else did.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.220]   And in Genesis chapter seven, verse four,
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.260]   it says he shuts the door to the ark.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.380]   And do you know what happens?
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.500]   His family and all the animals get on the ark.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.340]   He shuts the door.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.580]   Do you know what happens?
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.460]   Ready?
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.720]   Nothing.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.480]   Nothing.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.740]   For seven days.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.960]   Dude.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.800]   He's on there with his wife.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   Do you remember last week when I said
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.220]   her desire will be for her husband's job?
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.240]   Can you imagine for a moment,
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.040]   he's on that ark, shuts the door,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.300]   and seven day, I mean, sun up, sun goes down,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.560]   nothing happens.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.740]   Noah, honey?
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.580]   Are you sure he didn't say build a park?
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.100]   Or buy some art?
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.780]   I mean, are you sure, baby,
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.260]   that you understood him correctly?
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.340]   You ever waited on God?
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.260]   You ever did everything you were supposed to do
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.620]   and it seemed like he didn't show up?
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.260]   And you sat there and you waited.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.840]   But on the seventh day, it began to rain.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.840]   And it rained for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.640]   But if I can't swim after four, anyways.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.460]   Waters fell from the sky and it says
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.420]   they gushed forward from below.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.540]   And it says Noah walked with God.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.940]   He did everything the Lord commanded him.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.620]   Genesis chapter seven, verse five.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.840]   Noah trusted God.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.740]   He was on the ark for one year.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.620]   And he did what God asked,
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.380]   and so God made another promise.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.180]   And it's called the Noahic covenant.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.780]   So God made another covenant with Noah,
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.620]   and I'll read it to you.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.320]   It's Genesis chapter nine, verses 11 through 15.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.340]   I established my covenant with you.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.100]   Never again will all life be destroyed
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.460]   by the waters of a flood.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.420]   Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.720]   And God said, this is the sign of the covenant
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.700]   I am making between me and you
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.420]   and every living creature with you.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.620]   A covenant for all generations to come.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.260]   I have set my rainbow in the clouds
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.540]   and it will be the sign of the covenant
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.140]   between me and the earth.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.940]   Whenever I bring clouds over the earth
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.020]   and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.000]   I will remember my covenant between me and you
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.700]   and all living creatures of every kind.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.340]   Never again will the waters become a flood
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.120]   to destroy all life.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.060]   And imagine if God hadn't given us this sign.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.260]   Every single time it would rain, we would be terrified.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.820]   Every time it rained, we would be looking for a boat,
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.820]   be looking for some sort of refuge.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.540]   But we have this Noahic covenant which says this,
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.680]   be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.740]   It says that a part of, I'm gonna go through
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.200]   the parts of the Noahic covenant.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.480]   Be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.900]   God gives animals the fear of man,
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.260]   which is interesting that that's even in there.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.460]   And it's so true, like think about it.
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.940]   I mean, I grew up on a farm, okay?
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.380]   I did, I know that's crazy.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.380]   Red pants and a straw hat, I did though.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.980]   And so there I am and I remember one night we were camping
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.980]   and I would hear like coyotes in the distance
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.940]   and I'd be afraid and my parents would tell me,
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.260]   hey, they're more afraid of you than you are them.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.400]   It turns out that's biblical.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.240]   That's absolutely true.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.580]   I remember being in 4-H, walking this 1200 pound steer
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.160]   around a ring that was afraid of me.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.260]   A 1200 pound animal afraid of me.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.500]   I was like all but 75 pounds.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.060]   You know, wet and this guy is afraid of me
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.540]   because God has given animals the fear of man.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.920]   Animals are provided as food.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.960]   So you can be a vegan on principle but not by religion.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.580]   Okay, 'cause God has given us filet mignon.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.860]   It's a gift from him.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.760]   Anyone who murders a human will be brought to justice
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.720]   because humans are made in God's image.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.800]   And God will not destroy the world by flood again.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.440]   He will never use flood or waters
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.340]   as a weapon of mass destruction
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.560]   and he gives us this sign known as the rainbow.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:23.160]   And so God provided a way to save his chosen people
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.460]   in a what?
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:29.100]   What did Noah build?
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.660]   Who knows what an ark is?
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.900]   How would you define an ark
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.300]   when you came in here this evening?
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.460]   A giant boat?
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.620]   An ark is not a boat.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.320]   In fact, if you look up ark in Webster's dictionary,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.160]   the only reason we even define ark as a big boat
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.780]   is because of this man Noah.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.840]   You know what an ark is?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.180]   An ark is a protective container.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.380]   A protective container, that's what an ark is.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.820]   Think of the Ark of the Covenant
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.020]   if you know your Bible, right?
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.500]   Though an ark is a protective container.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.600]   God asked Noah to build a protective container.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.420]   What's the difference between that and a boat?
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:13.180]   An ark has no propulsion, no rudder, no steering wheel.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.180]   It just floats.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.460]   It can't go anywhere.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.380]   It is completely and fully at the mercy of God.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.100]   Do you know the ark didn't have any windows
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.580]   except for above?
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.780]   The only thing that Noah could see was the sky.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.320]   He had to completely trust that God would at some point
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.140]   in these hundred years dry up the water.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.300]   And if Noah looked out and he did see land,
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.540]   he'd have no way to get to it.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.500]   It's not like he could turn the ark on and drive over there.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.420]   He just had to wait for that land to come to him.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.060]   There's nothing he could do
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.900]   but sit in the protective covering of God.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.420]   He had to trust fully.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.300]   Guys, can I tell you something?
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.980]   You know what you want in life?
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.960]   A lot of you, you want what I wanted for a long time.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.520]   You want control.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.480]   You wanna sit at the steering wheel
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.120]   and you wanna control your life
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.480]   but you're not in control of your life.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.960]   You'll never be in control of your life.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.240]   You're like, yes, I am, JP.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.680]   I could leave right now if I want to.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   You can leave until God touched your heart
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.260]   and gives you cardiac arrest or brain aneurysm
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.180]   or swipes your legs out from under you at his will.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.360]   You're not in control.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.540]   I've seen this play out beautifully with my kids.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.880]   When my daughter Presley was Weston's age,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.220]   when she was about three years old,
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.280]   just a little toddler, we would go to the store
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.520]   and we would get in those grocery carts.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.800]   Have you seen those grocery carts
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.360]   with the car on the front,
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.080]   kind of truck on the front and the steering wheel?
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.920]   Have you seen this?
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.800]   I don't know if you have, if you're not a parent
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.760]   but it's a big thing in our house, right?
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.360]   'Cause she always wants to get that car.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.020]   Like, daddy, let me sit in the front
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.280]   and we'll play this game at the grocery store.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.400]   I'm pushing the cart and she's driving.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.880]   She's sitting in the front of that cart
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.280]   at the little steering wheel
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.860]   and she'll steer right and I'll take us right
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.880]   and she'll steer left and I'll take us left.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.360]   I will make her think that she is driving.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.800]   It was awesome.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.400]   And I would go wherever she'd go.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.720]   Like, she'd crash in the apples.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.160]   I mean, apples are coming down.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.560]   Like, I would just convince her, like, you are in control.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.960]   She'd go right, I'd go right.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.360]   She'd go left, I'd go left.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.200]   And she was just in control.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.600]   And sooner or later, she would steer right and I'd go left.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.820]   And I'd watch her, I'd watch her.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.320]   Just like you and me, she'd grip that wheel
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.880]   and she'd struggle.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.920]   I'm turning right, right.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.200]   And I'm like, left.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.360]   Because I had stuff I needed to do.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.320]   I had an agenda, right?
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.040]   I couldn't play the game forever.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.680]   And it became this, really, listen to me.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.680]   It became this really powerful metaphor in my life
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   that my control is an illusion of God's will.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.480]   Sometimes I steer right and he takes me right.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.360]   Sometimes I steer left and he takes me left.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.240]   But sometimes I steer right and he takes me left.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.340]   And he just says, JP, I've got stuff I gotta do, man.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.400]   And I need you to trust me right now.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.240]   We had fun, you playing that little game,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.260]   thinking you were in control.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.160]   But JP, you're not in control.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.280]   I'm in control.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.520]   You're not God.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.280]   He's God.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.360]   Noah's at the mercy of God on this boat
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.560]   with no rudder, no propulsion, no propeller,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.740]   no steering wheel.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:39.540]   So guys, if you hadn't caught on to this powerful picture
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.960]   of what this is, Noah made a way of salvation
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.400]   out of a wooden structure.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.480]   And anyone who trusted in this wooden structure
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.840]   would be saved as God washed away the sins of the world
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.920]   as his wrath came down from heaven, okay?
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.320]   His wrath, the very thing that came down from heaven,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.000]   it lifted up the ark, this thing that Noah built in faith
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.840]   and this protective covering, and it protected him.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.460]   And likewise, Jesus goes to a cross,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.180]   a protective covering for you, making it for you
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.480]   that you would stand against the culture of the world,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.200]   the currents of this culture,
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.880]   and you would be protected by this container,
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.160]   a covering of the blood of Jesus Christ,
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.040]   his provision, making atonement for your sins,
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.160]   a substitutionary payment for your sins,
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.800]   that that happened through Christ.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.880]   Noah's a type of Christ pointing to Jesus,
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:39.280]   that as God's wrath came down, now on the cross,
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.200]   now on his son, that you're protected.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.520]   See, God would deal with sin again.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.300]   He would wash away the sins of the world again.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.940]   But this time, it wouldn't be humans who were crushed.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.060]   It would be one human who was crushed,
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.320]   and that human was fully God, a fully man,
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.420]   in the form of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:11.100]   And can I tell you something?
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.820]   If you've trusted in the cross,
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.340]   the cross has no steering wheel.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.300]   The cross has no rudder, the cross has no propeller,
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.180]   the cross has no propulsion.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:26.180]   The cross is carrying you safely into the presence of God
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:30.800]   on its timing, on God's schedule.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.380]   And as you move through this world,
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.460]   you cling tightly to the cross.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.020]   It's all you've got.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.340]   You think you've got other things.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.240]   You don't, man, it can be washed away.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.980]   You got the cross.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.640]   100 years from now, it's the cross and nothing else.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.740]   That's what you got.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.860]   And so Noah preserved humanity selflessly, right?
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.100]   He wanted to save himself.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.500]   Christ preserved humanity selflessly.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.260]   He crushed himself on your behalf.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.540]   In fact, 2 Peter 3, verse three through seven says this.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.580]   Above all, you must understand that in the last days,
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.660]   scoffers will come scoffing
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.400]   and following their own evil desires.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.160]   They will say, where is this coming he promised?
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.720]   Ever since our ancestors died,
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.180]   everything goes on as it has
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.420]   since the beginning of creation.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.420]   But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word,
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.780]   the heavens came into being
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.100]   and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.580]   And these same waters,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.340]   also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.860]   By the same word, the present heavens and earth
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.980]   are reserved for fire now,
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.300]   being kept for the day of judgment
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.120]   and destruction of the ungodly.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.700]   Guys, judgment's coming again, man.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.800]   And so my last and final point,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.980]   last thing I wanna talk about
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.960]   is the application of Noah's story.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.460]   Application of Noah's story.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.420]   Christian, if you're here, follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.220]   if you're here, you've identified with Jesus
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.700]   through his death and resurrection,
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.260]   you stand firm in the scoffing.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.660]   Others are gonna make fun of you.
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.260]   They're gonna ask you why you do the things
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.020]   you do, why you don't spend the money,
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.620]   your money the way they do,
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.220]   why you don't go and get drunk the way they do
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.980]   or go and have sex the way they do,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.300]   why you don't date the way they do,
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.540]   why you don't work the way they do.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.540]   You stand firm in the scoffing, friend.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.340]   Stand firm.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.140]   Stand against evil.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.140]   My friend who passed away in the past couple of years,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.700]   he just talked about what we're in
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.580]   and called it the spiral of silence.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.740]   That Christians aren't standing up against what is evil.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.360]   We're just going on about our day, silent.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.980]   Secondly, you faithfully do all that God asks of you.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.820]   Do you hear me?
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.140]   Faithfully do everything God asks of you.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.180]   Some of you, you're here and you're like, man, JP,
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.420]   if God asked me to go to Africa, I'd be there, man.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.500]   I would go.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.780]   I'd be buying my plane ticket one way even, bro.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.460]   And I'm like, that's awesome, man.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.020]   What if he asked you to a life of celibacy?
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.260]   Same excitement.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:22.820]   What if he called you to purity?
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.020]   Are you still obeying?
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.380]   What if he called you to a life of sobriety?
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.700]   Are you still all in?
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:33.220]   Africa?
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.760]   Haiti even?
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.140]   Celibacy.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.780]   What if he called you to singleness?
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.140]   You okay with that?
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.900]   You okay?
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.940]   You're like, God, I trust you.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.420]   If that's what you want from me, man,
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.060]   I'll serve you as a single man or woman
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.940]   the rest of my life.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.900]   You good with that?
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.740]   God's people respond to God's commands in obedience.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.620]   We don't get drunk on wine like the Scriptures say.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.460]   We don't lust after things that don't belong to us
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.300]   like the Scriptures say.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.100]   We care for the poor around us.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.040]   Okay, we're generous.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.820]   What if he calls you to generosity?
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.160]   We don't desire riches.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.300]   Let me say that again, okay, in case you fell asleep.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.200]   We don't desire riches, 1 Timothy 6, verse nine.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.820]   We use words to build up, not to tear down.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.840]   Ephesians 4, verse 29.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.500]   We don't worry, Matthew 6, but instead we trust God.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.380]   And we show others the way.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.400]   You show others the way.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:41.120]   One time when I was younger, I was touring a church.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.620]   We were taking a tour of a church.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.600]   And they pointed to the roof and they said,
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.320]   "Hey, we want you to notice something.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.680]   "The roof was like Noah's Ark."
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.900]   And they said, in fact, this, they said,
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.040]   "Many roofs are made like Noah's Ark."
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.160]   Here's a picture of one.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.580]   I just Googled this one, right?
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.360]   "Many roofs of churches are made to look like Noah's Ark."
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.400]   They said, "We want to be a refuge
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.880]   "from the people of our culture to come into
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.200]   "and be saved, that they would trust
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.360]   "in the finished work of Jesus Christ and be saved.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.760]   "We want to be salt and light.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.420]   "We want to preserve the ideologies of Christianity,
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.960]   "of Jesus Christ, of the one true God."
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.300]   And so we call people to him.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.660]   You are like Noah.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.740]   Hey, come and be saved.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.820]   Come here, accept God's grace,
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.100]   walk with the Lord in obedience to him,
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.660]   and call others to the Lord,
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.780]   others to the Lord's provision of grace, right?
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.740]   Second Peter chapter two, verse five says
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.860]   that Noah was a preacher of righteousness.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.540]   I believe that Noah did this, but no one came.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.500]   But you spend your life, Noah spent his entire life,
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.300]   every waking day, walking in obedience to God.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.780]   What if that's your epitaph, man?
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.300]   What if that's your tombstone?
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.020]   What was she like?
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.940]   Well, she was righteous and blameless,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.940]   and she walked with God.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:10.860]   The end, if that's all anything anybody ever says of you,
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.220]   praise be to God.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:17.100]   That is an amazing epitaph.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.940]   That's an incredible testimony.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:24.540]   And so friend, if you're here tonight,
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.260]   and you haven't responded yet,
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.240]   I need to tell you about God's judgment.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.400]   It's coming.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:45.540]   He's going to judge every deed you've done,
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.860]   everything you've thought, and every word you've spoken,
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.220]   things you did all by yourself that no one will ever know
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.220]   but God knows, unless you trust in Jesus Christ
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.020]   as a payment for your sins,
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.500]   that Jesus died in your place, a substitute.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.700]   He died the death that you deserve
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.300]   so that you can live the life that he deserves,
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.760]   being a perfect son of God.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.460]   It is your only chance.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.820]   Get on the ark!
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.580]   Get on the ark!
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.940]   It's the only shot you have.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.220]   Cling to the cross, it's your only hope.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.420]   You wanna live, it's your only hope.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.660]   It's the only chance you have to live.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.540]   You cling to the cross of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.620]   You trust in his death and resurrection
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.180]   for the forgiveness of all your sins
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.940]   that they've been wiped away,
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.580]   that they've been paid for.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.500]   It's your only strategy.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.900]   It's your only chance.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.140]   It's your only hope.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.280]   There was judgment in the flood when the waters came down.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:07.020]   And the only thing that separated the people,
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.900]   you say, "But what about the people that died?"
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.500]   The only thing that separated those people from hell
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.380]   was more days of unrighteousness.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.380]   God only expedited that for them.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.800]   God only saved them from more violence, more condemnation.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.460]   That's what a righteous, just God did.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.940]   And there was judgment on the cross.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.580]   That God's wrath came down on Jesus,
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.740]   that Jesus makes a way for people into heaven,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.480]   and that judgment will come after the scoffers.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.880]   Jesus, when he was on the earth, said this,
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.060]   and I'll wrap up.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:47.400]   Matthew 24, verse 36.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.460]   But about that day or hour, no one knows,
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.900]   not even the angels in heaven or the Son,
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.040]   but only the Father.
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.540]   As it was in the days of Noah,
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.900]   so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.460]   For in the days before the flood,
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.500]   people were eating and drinking,
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.740]   marrying and giving in marriage.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.860]   Up to the day Noah entered the ark,
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.020]   and they knew nothing about what would happen
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.180]   until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.980]   And that is how it will be,
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.460]   at the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.900]   He says there'll be a bride and a groom,
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:22.820]   and there'll be, you know,
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.780]   for richer or poorer till death do us.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.740]   [shushing]
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.940]   Didn't see that coming.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.860]   Well, that's because you didn't listen
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.260]   to my friends at the porch.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.020]   When they went to work and they pleaded with you.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.420]   When they begged you to repent.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.380]   When they shared these truths with you,
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.880]   you didn't see that coming
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.040]   because you didn't listen to them,
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.700]   or they didn't share faithfully.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:53.660]   That's why you didn't see it coming.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.660]   In summary, the evidence supports this happened.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.300]   The significant of Noah's story
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.140]   is that it points us to Christ.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.900]   And the application for you and me is to do
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.700]   as Noah did, and trust God.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.340]   And I told you that God would be good in this.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.340]   This story in here ends,
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.540]   I didn't read the last sentence.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.380]   It says this,
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.660]   "God's strong anger against hate and sadness and death
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.420]   "would come down once more,
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:32.260]   "but not on his people or his world, no.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.900]   "God's war bow, the rainbow,
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.020]   "was not pointing down at his people.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.420]   "It was pointing up into the heart of heaven."
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.940]   And I read that and I was like, oh, that's cute.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.220]   Sally Lloyd-Jones kind of finished it with that.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.060]   And then I studied the Hebrew,
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.140]   and the word here for rainbow is kasheth.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.380]   It's God's weapon of destruction.
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:02.180]   It is a weapon that they would use in battle.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:06.820]   And God didn't hang it in the sky like a U.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.820]   He hung it in the sky, pointing up at him,
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:16.820]   saying the next time my wrath will come down on sin,
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:22.340]   it will not be on you, friends, it will be on me.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:25.060]   That's my plan.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.060]   Since the beginning of time,
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.940]   that God's kasheth, his war bow,
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.220]   is pointed in heaven.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.940]   When you see that thing, Fort Worth,
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.180]   when you saw that last week,
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:45.180]   you remember God's promises, that he loves you,
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.940]   and he's never gonna judge the world again by water,
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.580]   but judgment is coming, this time by fire.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.620]   Call people to the ark.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.380]   Call people to the cross.
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.220]   Let me pray.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:12.140]   Father in heaven, thank you for the faithfulness of Noah.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.060]   Thank you for the example that you've given us
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.780]   and a man who spent every day of his life
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.740]   really building this thing
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:30.060]   that you would use to protect and preserve humanity,
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.020]   this ancestor of ours, of all of ours, Noah.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.180]   Father, out of the room tonight,
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:41.020]   would you make men and women who are like Noah,
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.020]   who would faithfully walk with you, stand against scoffing,
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.100]   share the truth that others need to get on the ark
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.580]   after having trusted in the cross themselves.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.220]   Would you do that in us?
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.740]   In Jesus' name, amen.
