1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:22,840
 - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Porch.

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,520
 If we haven't met, my name is JD,

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,280
 and we are so glad that you are here.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,840
 Like Carson said, we have been going through a series

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,280
 called The Seven Deadly Sins.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,480
 And we've been talking about different things

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,720
 that people have just said,

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,840
 hey, we know that all sins are equal,

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,920
 but these things, these seven sins,

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,120
 if you let them rule your life,

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,160
 dictate your life and how you live,

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,880
 it can end catastrophically for you.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,240
 We've talked about anger, pride, greed, lust,

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,480
 so many different things.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,840
 And we are finishing strong tonight

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
 with the deadly sin of jealousy.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,680
 And right off the bat,

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,040
 a lot of people in this kind of seven deadly sin talk,

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,480
 some say it's envy, some call it jealousy.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,600
 I'm gonna kind of just mix the two together.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
 I'll be saying jealousy a lot tonight,

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,820
 but I just wanna define what those things

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,900
 are clearly for us.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,220
 And so envy or jealousy, right off the bat is this,

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,080
 a feeling of discontentment

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,080
 caused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,600
 That's how people in the world today define jealousy.

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,960
 A feeling of discontentment caused by someone else's

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,880
 possessions, qualities, or luck.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
 And basically what that means in casual language

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,680
 is when someone else has something that we want

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
 or we desire, we look at what we have and what they have.

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,920
 And there's just like this angst that we have

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,000
 towards them that builds up, and that is jealousy.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
 And I was just thinking about this

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
 over the 4th of July weekend,

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
 I was looking at Instagram and I was like, there it is.

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,980
 If you wanna find a jealous JD, invite him to the lake,

40
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,360
 because that is when all of the insecurities in me come out.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,960
 If anyone has been to a day at the lake,

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,080
 we've all been there, we've all seen it.

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,200
 You get there, every dude, it seems like,

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,060
 just can't wait to take off their shirt.

45
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,440
 I can't wait to like keep mine on.

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
 Everyone is like taking a thousand pictures.

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,640
 I'm like, why do we have to take,

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,280
 I'm always like the one guy with his shirt on,

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,320
 like what's up?

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,600
 And it's just like the worst thing ever.

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
 It's just like, everyone's hugging and you're like,

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,400
 oh, this is so weird because we're all in our swimsuits.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,120
 And I am just like this like pit of insecurities,

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,920
 but I'm also looking around at everyone

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,280
 and I'm examining like what they look like.

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,320
 And I'm like secretly like judging people.

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
 And I'm just like, man, they just look at them.

58
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,000
 They just work out so much apparently,

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,940
 they just want everyone to see.

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,600
 And I'm just infested with jealousy towards people.

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 Some of them I don't even know, but then it just gets worse.

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,400
 I know like a lot of us will get out on the boats

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
 and I'm the guy that's like sitting over to the side.

64
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,200
 You know, I'm drinking my Waterloo

65
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,920
 and I am sitting there and the music's playing

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,160
 and the guys was like, let's get the weightboard out.

67
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,960
 And I'm like, oh God, not the weightboard.

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,840
 And they get it out.

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
 I've never weightboarded before.

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,640
 I'm like more of a tubing guy.

71
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,600
 I'm over here like I'll chill

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,260
 till the tubing segment comes along.

73
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,480
 That's when I'll show off my skills.

74
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,180
 And the guys start weightboarding, even the girls,

75
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,000
 a couple of them get up and then the inevitable happens.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,280
 There's always that guy.

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,240
 And he's usually like the sporty guy who's like,

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,480
 hey JD, why don't you give it a try?

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,680
 Like, get out there, give it a go.

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,720
 And I'm like, oh no, it's fine.

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,920
 Like you guys, let's make this day about y'all.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,160
 And everyone's like JD, JD.

83
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,120
 And I'm like, oh, so I get out there reluctantly.

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
 You know how it goes.

85
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,300
 Like you're supposed to like sit back

86
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,760
 and like hold the thing.

87
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,300
 And then they're like, you're ready.

88
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,160
 And you're like, oh yeah, I'm sure.

89
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,600
 And every single time, if you've never weightboarded,

90
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
 it's just like, (mimics beatboxing)

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,820
 every time and people are like, oh, it's your first time.

92
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,440
 And then the 10th time gets along

93
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,720
 and you're just getting more like shaky and tired.

94
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,160
 Your eyes and you've absorbed so much water

95
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
 and your life is just miserable.

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,000
 And so eventually you throw in the towel, you give up,

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,520
 you get back on the boat.

98
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,660
 And there's always that guy.

99
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,760
 For me, he was one of my dearest friends.

100
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
 His name is Kylan.

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,280
 Kylan is the guy.

102
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,680
 He just has the perfect hair.

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,000
 He has the wife.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
 He has the looks.

105
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,660
 He has the bod.

106
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,160
 He's just ripped beyond imaginable leaf.

107
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,300
 And he is like, I guess I'll go now.

108
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,240
 And he like hands over,

109
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,580
 he's the one that's been driving the boat,

110
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,300
 you know, with like looking all cool.

111
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,720
 And then Kylan goes and Kylan, ha, he gets out there.

112
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,080
 And he's like one-handed, like, all right, let's go.

113
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,680
 And Kylan just gets up perfectly.

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
 He's like, just like soaring.

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,640
 Like it's like he's gliding across the water.

116
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,400
 He's like, all right, spin it sharp.

117
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
 And you're like, no, he's not.

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,240
 No, he's not.

119
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,820
 All the cameras are out on Kylan.

120
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,920
 I'm sitting at the front of the boat,

121
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,640
 just mad shirt back on by the way.

122
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,080
 And he just jumps the wake and everyone's like,

123
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,920
 Kylan, Kylan.

124
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,080
 And I'm just like, Kylan.

125
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,800
 And that is what jealousy does.

126
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,200
 Someone I love, I'm now feeling some type of way towards.

127
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,240
 And he's just doing his thing.

128
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,920
 Like he's wayboarded all of his life

129
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,260
 and it's just fun to him.

130
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,500
 But for me, I was having no fun

131
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,020
 because that's the power of jealousy.

132
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,680
 Jealousy can destroy us from the inside out.

133
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,960
 It can take something that was once beautiful

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,780
 and united and divided and rip it apart.

135
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,740
 It can take someone that you once loved

136
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,900
 and it can form hatred.

137
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,940
 And jealousy can rob us of so much life,

138
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,940
 so many relationships, so much joy and peace and happiness.

139
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,140
 Jealousy will rip us from.

140
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,740
 Proverbs 27, four goes as far to say,

141
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,120
 anger is cruel and wrath is like a flood,

142
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,480
 but jealousy is even more dangerous.

143
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,180
 God's word says, hey, jealousy,

144
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,760
 those other guys have nothing on this.

145
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,000
 Jealousy is so dangerous.

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,060
 And so tonight I'm glad that we get to end

147
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,140
 just talking about something that God clearly cares about.

148
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,140
 And I just wanna do that by journeying through this story

149
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,540
 that Jesus tells a crowd in the book of Matthew.

150
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,340
 And so what we're gonna see here is Jesus

151
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,980
 is just sitting around with this crowd.

152
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,660
 They're sitting and he's telling again,

153
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,580
 a parable like I talked about a couple of weeks ago.

154
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,600
 He's just telling this story

155
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,980
 that's illustrating a deeper meaning and point.

156
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,620
 And in this story, what we're gonna see is three things.

157
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,860
 Three things about jealousy.

158
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,260
 We're gonna see first how jealousy presents,

159
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,220
 second, who jealousy resents,

160
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,140
 and then lastly, where jealousy relents.

161
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,420
 And I know some of you might be here and I'm like, okay,

162
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,740
 that's a little bit of a stretch.

163
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,500
 You guys have no idea how hard it is

164
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,220
 to come up with rhymes and like alliterations

165
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,040
 every single week.

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,940
 So actually it wasn't me who thought of that one.

167
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,780
 It was David.

168
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,540
 So if you have any problems in beef, like, all right,

169
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,780
 email dmarv@theporch.live.

170
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,340
 But where jealousy relents,

171
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,900
 and I was like, David, what does that mean?

172
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,660
 And it basically means like ends or stops, okay?

173
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,900
 Where jealousy ends or stops,

174
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,100
 but to keep us relevant and remembering

175
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,300
 where jealousy relents.

176
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,240
 So turn with me, everyone.

177
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,020
 We have a few friends in the house, socially distanced.

178
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,180
 Matthew chapter 20, if you're watching online,

179
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,020
 grab your Bible.

180
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,120
 We're gonna read a lot of scripture tonight

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,200
 and open up to Matthew 20

182
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,720
 and we'll read verses one through 12 together.

183
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,280
 "For the kingdom of heaven is like the landowner

184
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,320
 who went out early one morning

185
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,400
 to hire workers for his vineyard.

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,280
 He agreed to pay the normal daily wage

187
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,920
 and sent them out to work.

188
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
 At nine o'clock in the morning,

189
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,580
 he was passing through the marketplace

190
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,080
 and he saw some people standing around doing nothing.

191
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,260
 So he hired them, telling them he would pay them

192
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,860
 whatever was right at the end of the day.

193
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,960
 So they went to work in the vineyard at noon

194
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 and again at three o'clock,

195
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,360
 he did the same thing at five o'clock that afternoon.

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
 He was in town again

197
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,000
 and saw some more people standing around.

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,760
 He asked them, why haven't you been working today?

199
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,040
 And they replied, because no one's hired us.

200
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
 The landowner told him,

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,340
 then go out and join the others in my vineyard.

202
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,000
 That evening, he told the foreman to call the workers in

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 and pay them, beginning with the last workers first.

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,260
 When those hired at five o'clock were paid,

205
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,380
 each received a full day's wage.

206
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,960
 When those hired first came to get their pay,

207
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
 they assumed they would receive more.

208
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,920
 I mean, it makes sense.

209
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,080
 They've been there longer,

210
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,240
 but they too were paid a day's wage.

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,060
 When they received their pay, they protested to the owner.

212
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,760
 Those people worked only for one hour

213
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 and yet you've paid them just as much as you've paid us

214
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,280
 who worked all day in the scorching heat.

215
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,560
 Totally valid argument.

216
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,720
 These workers have been there all day since the morning,

217
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,820
 just working in the heat.

218
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,240
 They didn't have water fountains back then.

219
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,680
 They're sitting there going, hey, we're thirsty.

220
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,040
 We're tired. We're hot.

221
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
 We've been working all day.

222
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,600
 And you've been giving these people who got here

223
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,740
 at the end of the day,

224
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,720
 just as much money as you've given us.

225
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,080
 And I can even read that

226
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,200
 and be like the crowd members at the time going,

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,820
 hey, Jesus, that doesn't seem very fair.

228
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,220
 Like that seems like really unjust for the land owner

229
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,260
 to kind of give everyone the equal amount of pay,

230
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,520
 even though some worked harder than others.

231
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,040
 But what's so funny is a lot of times like jealousy,

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,760
 it doesn't just form.

233
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,660
 We don't just meet someone and immediately we're like,

234
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,920
 I'm jealous of you.

235
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,280
 Like, I mean, maybe sometimes,

236
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,960
 but a lot of times we need to like pin it on a reason

237
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,560
 or something that seems like unfair

238
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,920
 or like something that just seems off

239
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,520
 and create something within us

240
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,660
 that creates us to be jealous of a human.

241
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,700
 For these people, it was the fact,

242
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,800
 it was more circumstantial.

243
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,080
 They looked at them like, hey,

244
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,920
 it's not fair that the land owner is treating them

245
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,800
 and blessing them for something

246
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,520
 that I don't think they deserve.

247
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,000
 Look at verse 10.

248
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,460
 When those hired first came to get their pay,

249
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,940
 they assumed they would receive more,

250
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,540
 but they too were paid a day's wage.

251
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,080
 And then skipping down to verse 12,

252
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
 their response to that was,

253
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,760
 hey, those people worked only one hour

254
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,000
 and yet you paid them just as much as you paid us

255
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,040
 to work all day in the scorching heat.

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
 And that's what jealousy causes us to do.

257
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,000
 Jealousy causes us to fixate on people

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,380
 and make people the problem.

259
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,240
 And so how jealousy presents itself is through comparison.

260
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,880
 How does jealousy present?

261
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
 Through comparison.

262
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,160
 These people looked at their work

263
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,040
 and the time that they put in and they expected more.

264
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,760
 And once they compared their work

265
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
 to the amount of the other people's work,

266
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,240
 it didn't line up for them.

267
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,200
 And it created angst and jealousy

268
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
 towards them and the other workers.

269
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,800
 You see, the real issue isn't what we have.

270
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,840
 Like, it's not about exactly what I have.

271
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,280
 It's not even about a lot of times what others have.

272
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,560
 It's what I have in light of what others have.

273
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,800
 And when I begin to weigh what I have

274
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,720
 versus what other people have, AKA comparison,

275
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,960
 that's when jealousy starts to form in my heart.

276
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,980
 And when we start to compare,

277
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,880
 when we start to look at people and make them a problem,

278
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,280
 immediately there's gonna be separation and division.

279
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,920
 And we're gonna start to look at their job and go,

280
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,320
 well, I wish I had that job.

281
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,400
 Or we're gonna look at how they don't have any debt

282
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,340
 and how they're debt-free

283
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,720
 or they got a scholarship in college.

284
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,680
 It's like, well, I'm piling up in credit card debt

285
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,840
 and all different types of debt.

286
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,240
 We're gonna look at Instagram and scroll

287
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,720
 and see relationships and be like,

288
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,960
 how come they get to be in a relationship?

289
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,720
 I've waited my whole life for someone.

290
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,360
 I've protected myself or whatever,

291
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,620
 and I still don't have a relationship.

292
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,560
 We're gonna look at all these different things

293
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,120
 and start to compare, compare me versus them.

294
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,080
 My problems versus their problems.

295
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
 My hair versus their hair.

296
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,960
 My pay versus their pay.

297
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,020
 My followers versus their followers.

298
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,200
 My relationships, my people versus their relationships

299
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,160
 and their people.

300
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,720
 And it's just this constant battle that robs and steals

301
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,360
 and robs and steals.

302
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,080
 And it all comes through comparison,

303
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,560
 which is what fuels jealousy.

304
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,960
 You have to see that jealousy, it's like a blinder.

305
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,320
 It causes you to fixate on things

306
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,840
 and make you think they're the problem,

307
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,920
 but they're not actually the problem.

308
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,100
 The problem is you're comparing yourself

309
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,760
 to people that you shouldn't be comparing yourself to.

310
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,000
 It's like this.

311
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,840
 If I just, right now,

312
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,400
 let's say we were all here in the house and I said,

313
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,600
 "Hey, I wanna call up someone."

314
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,080
 And there's three jars here,

315
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
 each have a prize inside of them.

316
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,120
 All you have to do is open up a jar

317
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,840
 and you get whatever's inside.

318
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,160
 You are the lucky winner.

319
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
 And I just call on you.

320
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,140
 And let's say it's you,

321
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,060
 you come up here and you're thinking about it.

322
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,280
 There's not much strategy to it.

323
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,040
 There's not much that you can do.

324
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,760
 All you have to do is take a pick and be the lucky winner.

325
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,340
 You're gonna win something.

326
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,940
 So let's say you're thinking about it and you're like,

327
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,440
 "Okay, I picked this one."

328
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
 And what do you know?

329
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,080
 You win a Benjamin.

330
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,720
 You get $100 on the porch.

331
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,280
 And you're like, "Oh my gosh, this is the best day ever."

332
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,680
 I bet the crowd would be like, "Nice, okay, like 100 bucks."

333
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,200
 And you're feeling like a winner.

334
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,360
 You're like, "I made the right pick."

335
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,480
 But then let's say I call up someone else

336
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
 and let's say she comes up here and I'm like,

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,960
 "Okay, you have two options.

338
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,640
 You now get to pick whatever jar you want."

339
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,680
 And you're walking away.

340
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,720
 You're like, "Man, I'm so like, I got $100.

341
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,840
 I made the right pick, I am good."

342
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,980
 But then she comes and she's like,

343
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,560
 "Okay, I'll pick the opposite side."

344
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,560
 And she opens it up and she wins two free tickets to Hawaii

345
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,200
 'cause the porch got it like that now.

346
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
 And she gets to go on a vacation to Hawaii

347
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
 with someone that she wants to go with.

348
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,120
 And suddenly the crowd erupts and you're like,

349
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,960
 "Oh, what, Hawaii?"

350
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,080
 And you're thinking, "Why didn't I pick the left one?

351
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,640
 I just got a hundred bucks."

352
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,600
 And suddenly what was once seeming something

353
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,720
 that you were grateful for, was a value,

354
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,160
 is now nothing because you're comparing it

355
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,080
 to what the other person got.

356
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,040
 That moment, what was once filled with gratitude and joy

357
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,200
 is now robbed because of comparison.

358
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,880
 And that's what we do way more than we realize

359
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,080
 in our everyday lives.

360
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,800
 I thought about this, like a lot of times I get jealous

361
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,400
 of people I don't even know.

362
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,600
 Like it's really easy to be sitting at home

363
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,480
 on a Friday night and I'm like super content.

364
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,320
 I'm like chilling, watching something on TV, I don't know,

365
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,560
 probably like "Emperor's New Groove."

366
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,440
 And I'm watching it and I see, I'm like,

367
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
 "Okay, now I'll check Instagram."

368
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,840
 And I'm on Instagram stories.

369
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,800
 And I see one of my friends posted a story and I watch it

370
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,280
 and they're like out eating Mexican food.

371
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,120
 And this new guy I've heard about got invited.

372
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,840
 And had they been eating, I probably would have been fine

373
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,760
 not getting the invite,

374
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,720
 but how come a new guy got the invite and I didn't?

375
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,680
 And I was completely content

376
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,720
 until I started comparing myself to new guy.

377
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,560
 What?

378
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,960
 New guy, but he thinks he's funny.

379
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,880
 I bet he's the one like ruling the table right now.

380
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,720
 Like new guy, what's up with this new guy?

381
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,360
 And suddenly I just have all of this like built up tension

382
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,480
 towards new guy.

383
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
 New guy has done nothing, he just got an invite to go eat.

384
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,800
 But now the next time I see new guy, let's call him Bobby,

385
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,880
 I'm trying to call him new guy.

386
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,400
 Next time I see Bobby, Bobby's like, "What's up, man?

387
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,280
 I've heard a lot about you."

388
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,080
 And I'm like, "Yeah, nice."

389
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,640
 And I'm just like immediately just so jealous of Bobby

390
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,600
 for something Bobby couldn't control.

391
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,920
 Just like the girl right here,

392
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,640
 she couldn't control the jar that you picked,

393
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,320
 she just picked a jar as well.

394
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,520
 But so many times that's what comparison does.

395
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,360
 It makes people the problem

396
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,000
 and it causes you to miss out

397
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,760
 of what God is trying to show you.

398
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,040
 And so with all of this,

399
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,080
 when you realize that you've been robbed,

400
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,440
 when you realize that you've been just taken

401
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,040
 the chance of having happiness and relationships and peace,

402
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,240
 and you start to wake up kind of this like reality

403
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,200
 that people aren't the problem,

404
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
 and I should stop comparing,

405
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,480
 you have to address a deeper issue, which is point two,

406
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,120
 who jealousy resents, who jealousy actually resents.

407
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,920
 Because jealousy will lead you to think

408
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,840
 the problem is people, but who jealousy actually resents.

409
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,880
 Let's see in the story what Jesus has to say.

410
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,160
 Verse 13, "He answered one of them,

411
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,440
 "Friend, I haven't been unfair."

412
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,320
 So remember they're sitting here like to the landowner,

413
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,880
 like, "Hey, why are you giving these people

414
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,320
 "the same money as us?

415
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,000
 "We've done all these different amounts of,

416
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
 "we've done more work than them."

417
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,240
 And the crowd that Jesus is telling this to

418
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,840
 are probably like, "Hey, yeah, that really does seem unfair.

419
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,000
 "They should get more money."

420
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,840
 And this is what Jesus says, that the landowner says,

421
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,640
 "Hey, friend, I haven't been unfair.

422
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,240
 "Didn't you agree to work all day for the usual wage?

423
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,200
 "Take your money and go.

424
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,520
 "I wanted to pay this last worker the same as you."

425
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,720
 Verse 15 is powerful.

426
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,480
 "Is it against the law for me to do

427
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,320
 "what I want with my money?

428
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,640
 "Should you be jealous because I am kind to others?"

429
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,280
 Jesus, he anticipated the thoughts of the crowd

430
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,060
 and he leaned into that and said,

431
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,200
 "Hey, you have to remember something.

432
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,920
 "What people around you have been given,

433
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,960
 "the success they've seen, the looks that they have,

434
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,520
 "the body type they have,

435
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,580
 "the way that they've climbed the corporate ladder,

436
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,800
 "the way their family is,

437
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
 "the way what they've been born into

438
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,040
 "had nothing to do with them.

439
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,920
 "I get to dictate and I am the one who is in control

440
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,440
 "of what my children have,

441
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,340
 "of what my people have."

442
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,400
 Just the same way that this landowner got to dictate

443
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,560
 what he did with his money,

444
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,860
 so God gets to dictate what he does with his people.

445
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,960
 And so when you communicate that you have an issue

446
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,120
 with what someone else has versus what you have,

447
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,680
 and you're comparing yourself all the time,

448
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,300
 what you're actually communicating

449
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,760
 is that you are resenting God, not man.

450
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,020
 Who does jealousy resent?

451
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,620
 Your creator.

452
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,440
 You don't have a problem with creation.

453
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,000
 You actually have a problem with your creator.

454
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,520
 That's what jealousy does.

455
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,460
 Think about it.

456
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,320
 So much of our life,

457
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,480
 we look at other people's circumstances.

458
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,460
 I know for me, I look at people who have the perfect family,

459
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,360
 who eat dinner together like every Sunday night

460
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,320
 and are gathering around and telling stories and laughing

461
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
 and have inside jokes and maybe like make family TikToks,

462
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,800
 I don't know.

463
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,540
 And I'm like, "God, why would you not give me that?

464
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,740
 "Why would you not want that for me?

465
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,480
 "You're the one that's in control."

466
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,920
 And I had to remember, wow,

467
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,760
 like God gets to do what he wants when he wants.

468
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,820
 And it's when I think that I have a say

469
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
 is when I get in trouble.

470
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,420
 But I'm not content with what God's given me.

471
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,560
 I'm not interested in stewarding what God's given me.

472
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,520
 Therefore, I resent him.

473
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,360
 I say, and I think we say things like,

474
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,980
 "God, you didn't give me looks

475
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,440
 "like you gave that person looks."

476
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,280
 Girls, you might say,

477
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,400
 "God, you didn't make my waist a size two.

478
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,140
 "God, you didn't bless me with that family

479
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,940
 "or with that financial situation or with that spouse

480
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,860
 "or with those gifts, with that job.

481
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,680
 "God, why did my parents be the parents that divorced?

482
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,780
 "Why couldn't I have parents like theirs?"

483
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,600
 I know for me, like a couple of weekends ago,

484
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,780
 I spent the weekend with all my college roommates.

485
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,840
 They all have kids now.

486
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,080
 Some of them are on their second kid.

487
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,900
 They're all married.

488
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,980
 And they're just, they're sitting there with their spouses.

489
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,560
 And I'm the only single guy.

490
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,000
 Talked about that before, I think it's clearly an issue.

491
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,880
 And I'm just like, "God, what's the deal, man?

492
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
 "Like, why can't I be like them?"

493
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,800
 And I don't resent them.

494
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,000
 They're just, they met the one.

495
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,040
 They're doing their thing.

496
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,120
 They're living their life.

497
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,720
 Who I'm actually resenting is my creator.

498
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,680
 And I think a lot of us are there.

499
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,380
 We are upset with God.

500
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,080
 We would rather resent him and push him away

501
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,980
 and think he's out to get us or he's withholding from us,

502
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,880
 that he wants to bless other people and favor other people

503
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,400
 and not make us as gifted or as successful.

504
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,860
 We think that God is out to get us somehow.

505
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,120
 It's like we've forgotten all that he's done.

506
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,000
 Like earlier, think about this.

507
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
 What if I called up a third person?

508
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,200
 And what if they opened up the last jar

509
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,400
 and they got starburst?

510
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,680
 Starburst.

511
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,480
 And not even starburst, the orange and yellow starburst.

512
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,520
 Okay, the worst of the worst.

513
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,280
 The lowest of these, you could say.

514
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,080
 Once they opened up their orange and yellow starburst,

515
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,320
 suddenly I'm like, "All right,

516
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
 "well, at least I didn't get the yellow

517
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,520
 "and orange starburst.

518
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,740
 "My hundred's starting to look a little bit better now.

519
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,280
 "Miko, see now on me tonight."

520
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,280
 And that is crazy because we, at one time,

521
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,300
 were resentful because we didn't get the trip to Hawaii.

522
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,540
 But when we saw that we didn't get the starburst,

523
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,540
 we no longer resent, but we're grateful for the $100.

524
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,620
 I think a lot of us sit there with our lives.

525
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,120
 It's easy to sit in your single apartment alone

526
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,700
 and look at the married couple with their first house

527
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,280
 and first car in Labradoodle and resent them

528
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,720
 and resent how God is moving and blessing their life.

529
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,240
 But then when you sit and think what he's brought you out of

530
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
 and the job he's given you,

531
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,520
 or how you're not homeless or left alone

532
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,820
 and the people that love you,

533
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,700
 resentment starts to turn into gratitude.

534
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,920
 And your perspective of what God is

535
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,800
 and who he is starts to change.

536
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,720
 We have to stop resenting our creator

537
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,960
 and trust that he is in control

538
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
 and knows what to do with his creation.

539
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,720
 For those of you that are coming in here

540
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,000
 and you're recognizing, wow,

541
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,940
 I thought I had a problem with people.

542
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,540
 I thought I was jealous of that guy or that girl.

543
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,320
 I thought I wanted that job.

544
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,560
 I thought I needed that much money.

545
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,560
 And I thought God, I thought he just didn't hear me or care.

546
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,760
 I'm leaning in and I want you to hear me say

547
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,580
 that that just isn't true.

548
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,820
 That God loves you.

549
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,100
 More than anything, he loves you and he cares about you.

550
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,180
 And I had to remind myself of this often

551
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,980
 'cause I know that in my small limited mind,

552
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,260
 I can forget to zoom out and see the bigger picture

553
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,420
 and just focus on what's right in front of me

554
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,740
 or the people right in front of me

555
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,220
 or the circumstances right in front of me

556
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,380
 and forget that God isn't taking something from me.

557
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,940
 He's not withholding something from me.

558
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,120
 He's not playing like puppet master up there

559
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,660
 and just like doing all this crazy things

560
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,920
 to hurt me and to harm me.

561
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,980
 No, he is a father who is willing to give everything for me,

562
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,620
 who has given everything to me.

563
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,500
 I have to think about the fact that God has taken me out

564
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,660
 of so much broken sexual sin and addiction.

565
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,880
 He's taken me out of the depression I felt

566
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,260
 after my dad passed away.

567
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,020
 He's taken me out of the misery I felt from heartache

568
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,420
 and so many different things.

569
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,700
 And when I sit and I open up my perspective

570
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,660
 and I become grateful for what God has taken me out of,

571
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,180
 I no longer resent him.

572
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,000
 I rest in him, I trust him.

573
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,720
 And that's what I'm calling you to do.

574
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 Stop resenting God.

575
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,600
 Stop thinking that God is out to get you.

576
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,560
 He loves you.

577
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,640
 He wants to give you everything.

578
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,820
 But jealousy will do everything

579
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,440
 to not allow you to believe that.

580
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,920
 Here's what jealousy will do.

581
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,600
 It wants you to think that God robs you

582
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,180
 of all the things you want

583
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,940
 rather than gives you than all the things that you need.

584
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,880
 Jealousy wants you to believe that God robs you

585
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,180
 of all the things that you want

586
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,680
 rather than gives you all the things that you truly need.

587
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,000
 He knows you more than you know yourself.

588
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
 And you might look out and see people and think,

589
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,200
 I want that, I want that, I need that to survive.

590
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,340
 I need that to be happy.

591
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,560
 I need that to be joyful.

592
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,880
 And I trust you, you need to trust God.

593
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,680
 That's what we need, to rest in God.

594
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,600
 And when we do that, the third point will start to happen.

595
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,200
 Where jealousy relents, where jealousy ends and stops

596
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,820
 is when comparison turns to celebration.

597
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,320
 That is where jealousy ends, is with celebration.

598
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,760
 Just take a moment to sit and think about

599
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,560
 all that God's done in your life.

600
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,160
 Let celebration turn into gratitude

601
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,800
 and an awakening and a realization of,

602
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,640
 oh my gosh, God is at work.

603
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
 He is doing something in my life.

604
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,920
 First Thessalonians 5, 18 says,

605
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,200
 "Be thankful in all circumstances,

606
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,160
 for this is God's will for you,

607
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,280
 who belongs to Christ Jesus."

608
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,560
 Think about the last time that God clearly worked

609
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,040
 and moved in your life.

610
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,440
 Think about how grateful you were.

611
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,280
 Thank you, God.

612
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,600
 You were telling everyone, man, God, he gave me the job

613
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,760
 or God, he really pulled through.

614
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,840
 He heard my cry.

615
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,720
 I'm so grateful.

616
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,600
 I'm so thankful.

617
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,420
 Thank you, God.

618
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,260
 Thank you, God.

619
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,000
 And the more and more time from that moment

620
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,680
 that life goes on and life goes on, you start to forget.

621
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,520
 And time separates and no longer are you celebrating

622
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,480
 what God has done.

623
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,500
 You get back to comparing.

624
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,640
 You get back in your tunnel vision.

625
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,760
 You start to think, oh, things are out of my control.

626
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,600
 God, where are you at?

627
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,440
 God, where are you at?

628
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,680
 And you're not remembering what he did for you.

629
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,280
 Therefore, your life is not informed by celebration

630
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,400
 or gratitude.

631
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,620
 It now goes back into the cycle of jealousy and anger

632
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,960
 and bitterness and resentment and comparison.

633
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,400
 And now you're all out of whack again.

634
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,660
 And so you have to fight these things by celebrating,

635
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,340
 by being grateful.

636
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,540
 There are so many times in my life

637
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,160
 when I choose to be discontent over grateful.

638
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,980
 There's so many times where I let jealousy creep in

639
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,980
 and distract from what God's doing.

640
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,480
 There's so many times where he's blessed me

641
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,660
 with the hundred dollar bill and I'm going,

642
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,260
 but I wanted the trip to Hawaii.

643
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:28,360
 And I forget, but hey, you have taken me out of so much.

644
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,260
 And so my encouragement to you would be don't run away.

645
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,120
 Don't shy away.

646
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,780
 Don't let jealousy cause division between you and people

647
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,300
 or you and God, but rather turn jealousy,

648
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,180
 turn comparison, turn resentment

649
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,420
 into celebration and gratitude.

650
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,000
 I cannot stress this enough.

651
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,460
 It is a powerful weapon.

652
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,120
 The enemy of jealousy is out to rob you,

653
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,180
 but it will convince you that God's the thief.

654
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,500
 It'll convince you that God is taking.

655
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,260
 God is withholding.

656
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,460
 So how do you fight that?

657
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,900
 You remember what he's done and you celebrate it.

658
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,380
 But when jealousy does lead you to compare

659
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,500
 and make people the issue or resent God,

660
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,020
 when it gets hard to celebrate,

661
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,740
 I think what I was thinking about was like,

662
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,380
 what does this look like for me practically in my life?

663
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,740
 Like, how do I do this?

664
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,660
 How am I practicing this?

665
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,460
 And this is always like an encouraging thing for me

666
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,660
 to rework this like value of celebration.

667
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,460
 And I had to sit and think behind every person

668
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,900
 that I compare myself to as a story,

669
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,480
 a story of brokenness and mistakes, just like me,

670
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,620
 a person who needs Jesus, just like me,

671
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,900
 the person who needs the gospel, just like me.

672
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,420
 And I should go celebrate that.

673
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,020
 I should go lean in and hear their story

674
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,460
 and equalize them in my mind

675
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,820
 and watch how God has formed them.

676
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,500
 And when I started to see people made in the image of God,

677
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,020
 and when I started to see myself made in the image of God,

678
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,140
 it starts to be way easier to celebrate.

679
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,220
 And I started to do things like texting and calling people

680
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,860
 just to tell them what I see in them

681
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,260
 and how proud I am of them.

682
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,820
 I started to just, I recently in quarantine,

683
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,540
 I start sending selfie videos to people

684
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,060
 just to just pump them up

685
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,020
 and tell them the work I see God doing in their life.

686
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,980
 I make a list of my closest friend's birthdays

687
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,180
 to make sure I don't miss it

688
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,340
 and telling them what they mean to me

689
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,700
 and what their life means to me.

690
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,060
 And more than anything,

691
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,140
 I sit and I think about all that God's done in my life

692
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,260
 and I celebrate him for who he is and it changes me.

693
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,820
 It rids me of comparison

694
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,940
 and it brings me the joy and peace in him

695
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,020
 that I'm looking for.

696
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,740
 And how do I stay grateful?

697
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,260
 I've recently just charged myself

698
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,180
 to keep a running list of all the things I'm grateful for.

699
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,580
 I spent time just today writing down more things.

700
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
 God, thank you for my family

701
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,420
 I got to see over the 4th of July weekend.

702
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,260
 Thank you that you've brought my mom a spouse that loves her

703
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,340
 and I got to meet my new step siblings.

704
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,100
 Thank you God that you've provided me community

705
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
 in my first year here in Dallas.

706
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,500
 I know a lot of people still feel alone

707
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,860
 and I don't deserve such amazing people in my life.

708
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,800
 Thank you for my job and my health.

709
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,740
 And start off your prayers with just thankfulness

710
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,540
 rather than asking.

711
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,300
 And it will change your perspective on who God is.

712
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,800
 And you'll see jealousy start to lose its grip in your life.

713
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:17,140
 I know for me, like the longest stint

714
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,060
 where I saw jealousy really own me

715
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,500
 was in my high school years

716
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,820
 where I became extremely jealous of my little brother.

717
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,100
 My little brother, he's 17 months younger than me.

718
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,500
 He's like way taller than me,

719
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,420
 way more fit and athletic than me.

720
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,460
 And all of high school,

721
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,040
 I just jealousy turned to hatred in my heart towards him.

722
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,420
 The Bible talks about how can you say you love God

723
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,700
 and have hatred towards your brother?

724
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,460
 And I didn't.

725
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,260
 And I chose to resent him and bully him and be mean to him.

726
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,140
 In my life, my relationship with him,

727
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,860
 that was supposed to be leadership and love

728
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,260
 and stewarding him as my little brother.

729
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,060
 God entrusted me with a little brother.

730
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,780
 I missed it because I let jealousy divide

731
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,980
 and create hostility.

732
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,780
 And I missed so many opportunities.

733
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,820
 And thank God he's now moved to Dallas

734
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,480
 and we're trying to get weekly lunches

735
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,020
 where I can sit in and mend all the years of hurts

736
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,040
 and brokenness that I caused.

737
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,420
 And if you hear anything, don't make the mistake I did.

738
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,640
 Don't let jealousy dictate your relationships.

739
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,440
 Don't let jealousy rob you of one more thing.

740
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,000
 Because a life with God does not look like robbing.

741
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,160
 It does not look like taking.

742
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,500
 It looks like giving.

743
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,700
 Love, grace, freedom, forgiveness, what we actually need.

744
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,580
 But the reality was,

745
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,220
 is I was not pleased with my reality growing up.

746
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 Before Christ, I couldn't see what all he was doing

747
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,680
 in my life and what all he was orchestrating in my life.

748
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,320
 All I knew is I did not like my reality

749
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,920
 versus my brother's reality.

750
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,120
 And so therefore, instead of loving him, I hated him.

751
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,600
 And because of that, I hated God.

752
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,200
 'Cause I'm like, God, why did you not make me more like him?

753
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,040
 God, why am I the bad nerd?

754
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,720
 Why am I the guy that no one takes serious?

755
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,520
 Why can't I be more masculine

756
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,880
 in what society says makes a man?

757
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,840
 God, why did you make me the way that you did?

758
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,200
 And I resented God.

759
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,400
 Therefore, I didn't have a relationship with him.

760
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,040
 I didn't understand what he was about.

761
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,520
 And I missed so many years

762
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,880
 that could have been so fruitful to jealousy.

763
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,080
 And I missed the biggest reality,

764
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,920
 the most world-changing reality for every single one of us,

765
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,680
 is that there is a form of jealousy that is righteous.

766
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,040
 There is a form of jealousy that is okay,

767
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,640
 and it is possessed by God.

768
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,360
 God holds this form of jealousy.

769
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,080
 The Bible says in Exodus 34, 14,

770
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
 this verse just shook up my world this week.

771
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,440
 It says, God was talking to his people

772
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,320
 known as the Israelites in the Old Testament.

773
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,640
 He says, "You must worship no other gods.

774
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,000
 For the Lord, whose very name is jealous,

775
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,760
 is a God who is jealous about his relationship with you."

776
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,520
 And as I looked into that, I could not believe.

777
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,360
 Wait, you mean to tell me

778
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,760
 that the God who created the universe,

779
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,800
 the God who spoke and it was so,

780
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,000
 the God who sees me choose jealousy and comparison

781
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,880
 and resentment and resistance and anger

782
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,560
 and bitterness and frustration

783
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,360
 and doesn't trust him, it doesn't come to him.

784
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,280
 He saw that I was gonna do that,

785
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,000
 and he still is jealous of me?

786
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,520
 And for you, you might be sitting there thinking,

787
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,560
 there's no way that God would want me that bad.

788
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,880
 I know that he loves me,

789
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,160
 but I don't think he likes me enough to be jealous of me,

790
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,520
 to really want my time.

791
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,360
 I think he's okay if I kind of half-heartedly

792
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,240
 give myself to him, if I read my Bible here and there,

793
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,720
 if I pray every now and then.

794
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,280
 I just don't think he's that concerned.

795
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,200
 He kind of has the world to take care of, you know?

796
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
 Like there's a lot going on right now in 2020.

797
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,720
 If you haven't noticed, he's not worried about me.

798
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,400
 And I'm telling you that this says

799
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,600
 that God is jealous of you.

800
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,200
 He's jealous.

801
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,280
 He's so jealous of us.

802
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,040
 He wants our attention

803
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:34,600
 and our affections and our trust and our love so bad

804
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,480
 that he would be willing to send his son

805
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,800
 because he saw that we would get distracted.

806
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,040
 He saw that we would choose the world,

807
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,200
 but he said, I want them so bad,

808
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,720
 I'm gonna send my only son to die for them.

809
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,440
 That way I can be in relationship with them.

810
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,480
 I know they won't choose me all the time.

811
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,720
 I know they'll get distracted by other people in comparison.

812
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,280
 I know they're gonna resent me,

813
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,920
 but I want them.

814
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,040
 He wants you.

815
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,600
 (soft music)

816
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,200
 And that truth, it changed me.

817
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,040
 At the age of 19, when I woke up and realized

818
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,760
 that God loved me so much

819
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,800
 that he sent his son to die for me,

820
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,080
 that there was a creator

821
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,840
 that wanted me that bad, I couldn't resist it.

822
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,920
 And so what I want to beg of you tonight,

823
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,360
 if there's something that you think that God is doing

824
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,920
 that isn't fair,

825
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,200
 if he's giving of himself to the workers

826
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,840
 who haven't worked as hard as you

827
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,160
 or the people who haven't been through

828
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,120
 what you've been through,

829
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,920
 and it seems like they're getting the acknowledgement

830
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,000
 and the credit and the love and the blessings

831
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,760
 and the favor that you think you deserve,

832
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,680
 I'm here to tell you that that is a lie from the enemy.

833
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,240
 God loves you more than anything.

834
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,880
 And so stop running, stop resenting, stop comparing.

835
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,120
 You are being robbed and start trusting

836
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,600
 and start coming to that love.

837
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,960
 Let's pray.

838
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:29,920
 Father, it really is mind blowing that you would see

839
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,640
 our sin, that you would see our mistakes,

840
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,640
 that you would see our brokenness and choices,

841
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,160
 that we would choose other people,

842
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,880
 and yet you still sent your son to die for us.

843
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,160
 And I don't know what my friends tonight are,

844
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,600
 they're battling jealousy,

845
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,360
 if they're looking at other people's circumstances,

846
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,000
 if they're looking at other people

847
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,520
 and they've forgotten that they are created

848
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,680
 in the image of God.

849
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,760
 I don't know what people are dealing with tonight,

850
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,400
 but what I do know is that no matter what it is,

851
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,200
 you love them.

852
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,200
 You love them so much that you are jealous for them.

853
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,680
 You are a jealous God for his children.

854
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,800
 And so I pray tonight,

855
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
 if there's anyone that does not believe

856
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,080
 they are worthy of your jealousy,

857
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,880
 if there's anyone tonight that does not believe

858
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,720
 that they deserve that kind of love and trust and pursuit,

859
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,520
 that they would just stop believing the lie,

860
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,320
 that they have to do more or they've made too many mistakes

861
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,520
 and they would just open up their hands tonight

862
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
 and accept your love.

863
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,080
 For it's in that love, it's in your provision,

864
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,080
 it's in your goodness that we trust.

865
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,160
 May that be true of us tonight.

866
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,000
 Thank you.

867
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Thank you for wanting us. Amen.
