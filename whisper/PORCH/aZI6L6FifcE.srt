3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 My name is Josh Thames and I get to hang out with our Ports team over in Fort Worth.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hello to you guys specifically. So glad to be in the room with you.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hey, real quick, just going to start this off.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 My friends in the front room, you have a specific job tonight.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 You guys ready? Okay. You need to do this for me.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm kind of an excitable guy.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Last time, because all my friends in Fort Worth was getting streamed,

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I walked so far on this big giant stage, I just disappeared off the side of the screen.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So if you see me walking too far, will you just raise your hand real high for me?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Great. Thank you.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Again, my name is Josh. It's so good to be with you guys tonight.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And here's something that I've learned or that I've noticed in life.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 There's really just two paths in life. Okay.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And path number one is you go to college. Okay.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Path number two is you ride bulls for a living.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Seems to be the two options everybody has, you know.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And so many, just like many of you, I chose the second one.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I chose, hey, life is good. I'm going to ride bulls for a living.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And you laugh. The funny part is, is that's actually real.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 That's real in my life. I am legitimately, that's what I decided to do.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I looked at high school and said, I hate school. This is boring. I'm out.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I literally bought a minivan, threw my dog, my dog, cowboy into it.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And off we went, travel. I'm dead. I'm really serious.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And off we went, traveling to the country, riding bulls for a living.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And it was fun. We were making it, you know, and going from little county fairs to like the little bit bigger arenas.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I've been here a few times, been out of Houston a few times.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And then there came this day or this point in my life where I met a guy whose name is Jerome Robinson.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And Jerome Robinson looked at me and he said, hey, Josh, I want to coach you.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Now, that name means nothing to any of you guys, but Jerome Robinson qualified for the NFR, which is like,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 imagine like world finals of professional rodeo, right?

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 OK, Jerome Robinson went there 11 times. 11 times.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 He's been inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 This is the guy, this isn't connecting to anything.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 If you guys play basketball, it'd be like having Dirk as your coach.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 OK, that's what we're doing here tonight.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 So Jerome Robinson looked at me and said, I want to be your coach.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And it was awesome because he had done all of the things that I wanted to do.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I mean, he had been there, he had done it.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And I was like, this is amazing because now I'm getting coached by one of the greats.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And the reason that I start there tonight is because in a similar way,

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 we get to learn from someone who is not one of the greats, but the best, like the greatest of all time.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And it's Jesus. And we're going to get to see him.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 He's going to show us how we can beat temptation.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Jesus is like the undefeated, undisputed champ when it comes to temptation, like he's never lost.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Temptation, zero, Jesus a million. OK, Jesus has never lost.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And tonight we're going to see him. We're going to watch and learn from him and how we can resist temptation.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 There is no better coach than Jesus.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Now, here's the thing about temptation that I think is just really interesting,

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 is that most of the time we don't know we're being tempted until it's too late.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Are you guys tracking with me? I mean, what's crazy about this is that temptation,

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 we can trace all of the greatest regrets in our life, if you trace them back to temptation.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Like it's a really big deal. I just wrote down some of the things,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 some of the thoughts that I know that I have had and maybe some of you guys have had

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 that can be traced back to temptation.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 How about this one? How did I end up looking at porn and masturbating again?

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I never thought that I would end up with an eating disorder.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Or this, how did I wake up next to a complete stranger again?

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I always said I would never do drugs.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I don't know if you've been there, but here's the crazy part about temptation.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 If you would look at those moments, if you would remember,

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 if you would see that you someday were going to say that sentence or think that thought,

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 you would have never made the choices that got you there.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 It's the crazy thing about temptation, is that we don't often know that it's happening until it's too late.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And so that's why I'm excited tonight to learn from Jesus on how to beat temptation.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So if you're just joining us or if you're listening online, we're in a series called Jesus Walks.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And this is where we're just watching Jesus as he interacts with people here on earth.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And we're just watching and seeing and learning from the stories of him walking here on earth with us.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And so tonight we're going to see Jesus fights temptation as he interacts with Satan,

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 with the guy who's, it's his goal in life.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 It's his job description to tempt us, to pull us away from everything that God wants us to do

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 and to lead us down a path that may look good, but in the end, ends in destruction.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 We're going to watch the interaction.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Here's something that I found ironic, is that David's not here tonight.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And it's like, hey, Josh is teaching. David, what should he teach on?

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I don't know, the devil. Great. Thank you.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I'm glad to be here teaching about the devil with you guys tonight.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But here's, I just wanted to paint a little roadmap where we're going tonight.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And these are the three things that we're going to see, three important lessons that we can observe

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 as we watch Jesus face temptation and interact with Satan.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 It's these things. We're going to learn what is temptation.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 You can write this down. What is temptation?

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 What fuels temptation?

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And then what beats temptation?

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 So before we jump in, we're going to be in Matthew 4, in case you're wondering, you can open your Bibles.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 But before we get there, I want to give you a little bit of context.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Right before this, in Matthew 3, we see Jesus get baptized.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So it's really the beginning of his ministry, and we see him get baptized.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And it's really crazy. The Bible literally says that the sky opened up and God audibly said,

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 "This is my Son in whom I am well pleased."

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And so right before Jesus runs into temptation and meets Satan,

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 it's like the ultimate spiritual high. He has God himself speak out and say,

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 "This is my Son in whom I am well pleased."

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And that gives a little bit of the context of here before we jump in, Matthew 4.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 So Matthew 4, verses 1 through 11. I'll read it with us. It'll be on the screen behind me.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It says this, "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil."

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Just going to hit pause really quick.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You may read that and think that, "Man, is it God that's tempting him, or does God tempt us?"

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And I just wanted to say this just to clear it up at the beginning.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Satan tempts. God tests.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Sometimes God allows us to walk into temptation as a part of the test,

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 but God is never the one who tempts us.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And so I just want to clear that up at the beginning if you have that question.

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So jumping into verse 2. "And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And the tempter came and said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.'

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 But he answered, 'It is written, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."'

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him,

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Jesus said to him, 'Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their glory.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And he said to him, 'All these I will give you if you will fall down and worship me.'

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Then Jesus said to him, 'Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Then the devil left him, and behold, the angels came and were ministering to him."'

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And so, my first observation, the question that we are going to address tonight is this.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 What is temptation?

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Write this down. This is exactly what it is. I made it as easy to remember and write down as I could.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Temptation is the urge to do anything outside of God's will.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 The urge to do anything outside of God's will. This sounds really simple.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 This sounds simple like, "Oh man, that's easy to kind of get my hands around.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 That means I probably won't fall into temptation because if it's anything outside of God's will, I've got a good handle on that now."

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Here's the really crazy part, is that temptation is really hard to see in the moment.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Have you been there? It's hard sometimes to recognize what's happening right now is I'm being tempted.

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I'm being tempted to do something outside of God's will.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Here's how this worked for Jesus.

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 "The tempter came and said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.'"

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Here's the really crazy thing, is that often temptation, it's like a lie with a little truth to it.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Or maybe truth with a little bit of a lie to it.

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 You see, Jesus had the power to change these stones into bread.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 But really, what was happening? What was going on here?

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Really, Jesus had the urge and the desire for food. Is that wrong?

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It said he'd been fasting for 40 days. The guy's hungry. It's a natural urge.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Like, what's the big deal? Like, why is it a big deal that Jesus would turn the stones into bread?

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He had the power to do it anyways.

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And here's why. Because if Jesus would have used his power to provide the bread for himself,

137
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 he would have been declaring, "God, I don't believe that you're enough.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And I don't trust that you are good."

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Because in that moment, as he was hungry, Jesus was living inside of his humanity.

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 He was fully God and fully man.

141
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And instead of using the power that he had as God to turn the stones into bread,

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 he was needing to rely on God.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Just like he asked you and I to do.

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And what Satan was tempted with is just like, "Man, it's not the big of a deal.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 You've got a natural urge to eat.

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Just turn the stones into bread."

147
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Temptation's hard to see in the moment.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Because when you see that, when you hear that, it would have been easy for me.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I'm thinking, putting myself in Jesus' shoes, like, "I guess it's not that big of a deal. I guess I can."

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Here's something I thought of.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Wouldn't it be a lot easier if every temptation came like the two little, like the devil on your shoulder and the little angels?

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 You guys know what I'm talking about?

153
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 You got any Emperor's New Groove fans in here?

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Yes. Me too. It still is one of my favorites.

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I remember the first time I watched it, my dad was like, "Let's just watch it again."

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Because it was that great.

157
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Anyways, do y'all remember that scene?

158
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Do y'all remember the scene where it's like a little, like, angel guy pops up and the little devil guy?

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I don't know what I should do."

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And this guy's like, "Hey, I'm going to lead you down the path of righteousness."

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And the little devil guy's like, "I'm going to lead you down the path that rocks."

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Y'all remember that?

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Yeah, sometimes I think that would be a lot easier.

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Like, it wouldn't be so hard to fall into temptation if we just knew right now what's happening is the little devil guy,

165
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 like the bad guy, is the guy that I'm listening to.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 The problem is it's actually not that easy.

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's not that easy.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It, like, comes in like little subtle lies.

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It usually comes by telling you or convincing you that something that looks good is going to continue to lead to good.

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Like, man, this isn't just going to be that big of a deal.

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I mean, it's just one time.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Right? Like, weed isn't that big of a deal.

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Like, one time.

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Or like, I'll just have one beer.

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Like, it always comes.

176
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It's just, it's small.

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 It's hard to tell what's happening in the moment.

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Temptation is hard to see in the moment.

179
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And so, if temptation, if it is the urge to do anything outside of God's will, here's what temptation is not.

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Because what I don't want you guys to walk away is just thinking every time that I think about something I shouldn't do, I'm in sin.

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Temptation itself is not sin.

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Temptation itself is not sin.

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 When Jesus was being tempted, when he was, when Satan was looking at him like, hey, use, like, fulfill your appetite outside of God's will or God's way, he wasn't in sin in that moment.

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 In fact, we can see this.

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Hebrews 4.15 says this.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 "We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted, as we are, yet without sin."

187
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 It's not a sin to have a desire or an urge to do something contrary to God's will.

188
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Sin occurs when we put action to it.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 When we put action to it.

190
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Like for me, it's like, hey, I'm just scrolling through Instagram and is it that, is that time I'm hoping I find a bikini pic?

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Or will I put my phone down?

192
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And when I, as soon as I have that thought, will I put my phone down?

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Because it's not the temptation that is the sin, but it's when I decide, like, I'm going to act on it, that it becomes sin.

194
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And so what did that look like for me?

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Or what has that looked like in my life?

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I wasn't kidding when I told you that I rolled bulls for a living.

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 That's what I did.

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And so what that looked like is every single weekend I was in a new city.

199
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 In my, the way that I, the sin that I chose and the things that, like, I wanted and the appetite I wanted to fulfill was my desire for sex.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 An affirmation found in relationships with women.

201
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And so here I am in a new city every single weekend.

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Okay?

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 You guys ever heard of cleat chasers?

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 We call that something different in the rodeo world.

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 We call them buckle bunnies, okay?

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So there's these girls that show up to the rodeo and all they want is to hang out with the cowboys that are cool with the buckle bunnies.

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And here's what that looked like.

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 I mean, you laugh, but the temptation I had or the desire that I had to satisfy my, the sex, the all, and just affirmation from women, it looked like every time that I'm like, oh, yeah, I'll just find someone new.

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 You know?

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Every town was a new relationship or a new girl, maybe not even just a relationship, maybe just one night.

211
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I had bought the lie that it would bring me life.

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And ultimately what it did is it led to broken relationships and a lot of heartache.

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Especially heartache when I had to sit down and tell my wife about all of those times.

214
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And all the little, like, lies, long time, all the little temptation, like, it's just gonna be fun this one time.

215
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 It's not that big of a deal.

216
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I had bought in and it cost me a lot and it left all kinds of heartache and scars in my life that I've had to continue to work through.

217
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So even though sex is a God-given desire, I chose to fulfill it in a way that is outside God's will.

218
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 So I just want to recap this for you.

219
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 If you're one of those note takers, I kind of am.

220
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And so as I was writing this, I'm gonna make it easy for you guys.

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Here's a recap.

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Here's what we've learned about temptation is that it's an urge to do anything outside of God's will.

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 It's hard to see and it's not a sin unless we act on it.

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And so my second point for tonight is this, is the question I want to answer is what fuels temptation?

225
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Like, what is it that's behind temptation?

226
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Does it just come from nowhere?

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 What is it that fuels it?

228
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 How do we get to temptation to begin with?

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And it's a lie.

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Every single temptation that you and I face behind it is a lie.

231
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 There's a lie there that we are tempted to believe.

232
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 The lie that Satan wants you to believe ultimately is that God is not good, that he's trying to rip you off.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 That he doesn't want what's good for you.

234
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 He's just a cosmic killjoy.

235
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 He's looking at you and telling you, "Hey, don't do all the things you do want to do and do all the things you don't want to do."

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That's what Satan is trying to convince us of.

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And if he gets us to believe that, he really, he's got you.

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Because then there's no reason that we would follow God's way if we don't believe that God is good.

239
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And here's why I think it's easy also to believe that lie, is because not only does Satan tempt us,

240
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 but like our own desires are contrary and in contradiction to God's word and to God's way.

241
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Like the things that just our own hearts want, my own heart wants.

242
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Like I don't naturally go like, "Yes, you know what I want to do inside a conflict? I want to like lean in.

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 You know what, this person hurt me, I should probably go tell them about it.

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 No, I just kind of want to give him the finger and walk away.

245
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 That's what I want to do."

246
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Like we don't naturally head towards God's way.

247
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 I don't naturally.

248
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 James 1.14 says this, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires."

249
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 See, Satan isn't alone in the temptation and fueling them.

250
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He isn't the only one behind the lies that's fueling all the temptation.

251
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Often we fuel them ourselves.

252
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Here's the thing, these lies that you and I face every single day,

253
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I want to show you inside this text how we see that Jesus fought and how he had every single one of them,

254
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 or there's some that are really similar that he had that you and I have every single day.

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Because Satan, what he's doing is he was presenting a lie.

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 He was asking Jesus to step into and feed his appetite, feed his desire for approval, and then ultimately authority.

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Here's how, when he says, "Hey, Jesus, you're hungry? Why don't you just make these stones into bread?"

258
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 What he's ultimately saying is that God doesn't care about you, Jesus.

259
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 He wants you to be hungry, so you have the power to turn the rocks into bread.

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 He's appealing to his appetite.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Do any of you have appetites that sometimes pull you away from God's way?

262
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 He tempts him to live for the approval of men.

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 He says, "Hey, Jesus, I'm going to take you to the top of this temple.

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 You should throw yourself down, and you won't get hurt.

265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And because you won't get hurt, then everyone's going to approve you.

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Immediately people are going to believe in you because you did this."

267
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Are any of you ever tempted to live for the approval of others and not for God?

268
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And then we see he appeals to authority that, "Jesus, you can have all the authority that you want.

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 I'll give you all of the nations of the world."

270
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 He showed him all the nations of the world and said, "I can make you the authority of them today if you will just bow down to me."

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 You can pass the shortcut, like the shortcut of not having to go to the cross, all the pain that's coming,

272
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 you can bypass that if you will just bow to me.

273
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 It's a lie. Do you see the lie that's fueling temptation?

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Jesus did, and he wasn't fooled.

275
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But here's the ways in the way I think that we are fueling our own temptation.

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I think it'd be really hard, or I think it's hard for me,

277
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 that it's hard to fight the lie that more money equals more happiness

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 while I'm scrolling on Instagram watching all of my friends on awesome vacations driving nice cars

279
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 while listening to Cardi B talking about all the diamonds on her neck and all she wants is checks.

280
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 I don't know how we're going to fight that.

281
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 If that's what I'm feeding myself is I'm fueling my own temptation,

282
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I'm taking lies and I'm just injecting them into my mind.

283
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Because I'm looking at what everyone else has and of course it makes me want what they've got,

284
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and then what I'm listening to, what I believe in, I'm feeding,

285
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I'm fueling the own lies that are leading me into temptation.

286
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Like how about this one? I don't know how we expect to resist temptation

287
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 when the people that we call friends promote the lies that fuel our temptation.

288
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 How many of you have heard this?

289
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 It's not that big of a deal. We're just having fun.

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I mean God doesn't expect us to be perfect anyway.

291
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 We ourselves are fueling some of the temptation that's causing all the hurt and heartache in our life.

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Stop that. I need to stop that.

293
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Like look at yourself and just go, man, what are these?

294
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Because we can't just look at Satan and believe that he's the only one doing this

295
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 and begin to understand that we too are feeding ourselves lie.

296
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I remember the people that I called friends making fun of me

297
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 after I had trusted Christ and my life had changed,

298
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 making fun of me for not sleeping with the girl.

299
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 They're like, bro, you don't have to have sex with her.

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 You can just mess around a little bit.

301
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And they were feeding the lie, the disobeying God,

302
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 that going outside of God's way was just not that big of a deal.

303
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And what that looked like for me is I had to change my circle of friends.

304
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Like I just got to a point where I said, man, I can't continue to do this

305
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 because you guys are fueling lies that are leading me into temptation

306
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 that often is leading me into sin,

307
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 which ultimately hurts and causes heartache in my life.

308
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 If we're ever going to beat temptation, we need to know and remove all that we can that is fueling it.

309
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Do you guys know what a, I wrote this down actually.

310
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Do you guys know what a fire line is?

311
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Anyone know what a fire line is?

312
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 A fire line is when there's a big wildfire happening.

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 All the firefighters get together.

314
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 They pick like this strip of land where the fire is headed

315
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 and they rip out all of the trees and all the brush and chainsaws, ax.

316
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 They like get earth movers and they remove anything that can fuel the fire anymore

317
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 so that when the fire gets there, it chokes itself out

318
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 because there's nothing to burn on.

319
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 There's no fuel there.

320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And so while Satan tempts us and while he hates us

321
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and he's never going to stop feeding us lies,

322
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 man, don't you think that at least we can stop feeding ourselves the lies

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 that are leading us to temptation and then leading us to sin?

324
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And so as a recap for this one, what is it that fuels temptation?

325
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Lies from Satan and lies from our own desires.

326
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Now my third and final observation that we make from watching Jesus face temptation is this.

327
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 It's a question of what beats temptation?

328
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 What beats temptation?

329
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And it's this. It's rejecting the lie and accepting truth.

330
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Reject the lie and accept truth.

331
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 How did Jesus do this?

332
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Every time Satan tempted him, he said this.

333
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 It's a very simple line.

334
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 He says, "It is written."

335
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 He went to God's Word.

336
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 He would identify the lie behind the temptation,

337
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 turn to God's Word and accept the truth found there.

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 John 8, 31 says this.

339
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 "So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him,

340
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 'If you abide in my Word, you are truly my disciples

341
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.'"

342
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Lies fuel temptation. Truth exposes lie.

343
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And it gives us the ability to beat temptation.

344
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 We're never going to have the ability to beat temptation

345
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 if we don't know the truth behind it,

346
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 if we're not able to identify it.

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And so for you and I, the way that this looks is that we can--

348
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 how do we follow Jesus' temptation?

349
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 How do we beat the temptation in our life?

350
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And what are the things that you and I can do to be able to identify the lie

351
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 and then fight it with truth?

352
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Is we've got to know truth.

353
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 We've got to know truth.

354
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And we've got to know God's Word.

355
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 We've got to know what God's Word says about the lies that we are believing.

356
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Like how do we keep making--

357
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 or how do we stop buying lies that are causing us to hurt ourselves and others?

358
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 How do we keep ourselves from not making the same mistakes over and over again?

359
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 How long will it be before you actually stop looking at porn

360
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 and doing things you don't want to do?

361
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 As you reject the lie, you accept the truth.

362
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Here's what I want you to do.

363
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 This has been really helpful for me.

364
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 I want you to--whatever piece of paper you have, I want you to make just a T-chart.

365
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Can you do that?

366
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Make a T-chart on your little piece of paper, whatever you've got.

367
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Make a T-chart.

368
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I want on one side--I want one side to say, "Lies that I believe."

369
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And then on the other, "The truth that combats them."

370
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 "The truth that combats them."

371
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I want you guys--it's going to be really important for you to know

372
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 what are the lies I'm tempted to believe?

373
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Like what are the things--what are the little things that are being fed to me

374
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 or I'm feeding myself that I want to believe?

375
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And then take the time.

376
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Like spend time in God's Word, knowing it,

377
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 understanding what it has to say directly to that lie.

378
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And then show your friends.

379
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Bring people in.

380
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Let them know, "Hey, here's the things that I want to believe

381
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 that are easy for me to believe,

382
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 and then here's what I know that God's Word has to say about it."

383
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And then you can't just like know truth, friends.

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 We need to accept it.

385
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 We need to actually accept it.

386
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 It's not just one thing to know the truth,

387
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 but you've got to accept it and believe that it is true.

388
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 So reject the lie, accept the truth.

389
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And then invite truth in.

390
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 We have to love truth and be relentless about knowing and walking in it.

391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And so this is how we do this, is we confess.

392
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 If you have people in your life that are also wanting to pursue God

393
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 and wanting to turn away from all the things that are going to be hurtful,

394
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 that our temptation leads us to, you get in that community,

395
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and you just--as you run into life and as temptation hits you,

396
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 you begin to confess it at a thought level.

397
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Here's what this has looked like in my life.

398
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 There are men in the room that have got this text from me before.

399
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 "Hey, guys, I'm tired.

400
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I'm headed home.

401
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 No one else is home.

402
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And I'm going to be tempted to believe that turning to porn

403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 is going to actually satisfy me.

404
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Will you guys check in with me?

405
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Will you guys ask me about it?

406
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Will you ask me about it tomorrow?

407
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Will you check in tonight?

408
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Maybe will you come over?"

409
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 You invite truth in.

410
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Temptation is not a sin, but we need friends to help us identify lies.

411
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And then we confess failure.

412
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Friends, Jesus is the only one that's perfect

413
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 when it comes to fighting temptation.

414
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 So there's going to be times in our life that there's failure.

415
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 But don't sit in it.

416
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Like, let's not sit in it.

417
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 When we sit in it, it almost, like, gives it more power.

418
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I don't want to tell people, but let's drag it into the light

419
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 and to tell those in our life that we love and that love us

420
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 and just go, "Here it is.

421
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Here's what I did.

422
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Here's the lie that I bought.

423
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Here's what I did.

424
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Help me.

425
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Help me remind my heart of what God's Word has to say

426
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 and where life is truly found."

427
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 So we invite truth in by confessing temptation

428
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 at a thought level and then confessing failure.

429
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 So in summary, I can write this down, three things.

430
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Temptation is an urge to do anything outside of God's will.

431
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 There's a lie behind every temptation,

432
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and you combat temptation with God's Word.

433
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Here's what I want all of us to walk out of here in this room

434
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 knowing and understanding and believing,

435
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 is that Jesus, He is the solution to temptation.

436
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Like, He is the solution.

437
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 He's the only person that's ever been undefeated.

438
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And before you, like, roll your eyes, like, "Yeah, yeah,

439
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 that's because it's just Jesus."

440
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Like, you know, it would be nice to be the Son of God

441
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 walking into this temptation.

442
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Here's what I want you to think about.

443
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 If Jesus had given in to that temptation,

444
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 if Jesus had bought that lie,

445
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 if He hadn't rejected that lie and accepted the truth,

446
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 like, "No, I'm going to follow God's way,"

447
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 then He wouldn't have been able to be our perfect Savior.

448
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Like, the perfect sacrifice as He hung on a cross,

449
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 paying the penalty for our sin,

450
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 wouldn't have been enough.

451
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Because He no longer would have been perfect.

452
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 You see, what was at stake in Jesus resisting temptation

453
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 had everything to do with not just Him believing in God,

454
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 but also because He loves you and He loves me.

455
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 See, when Jesus rejected temptation, when He resisted that,

456
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 what it meant is that He had to go to the cross.

457
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Like, He didn't just get authority immediately.

458
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 He had to go to the cross, where on a cross He hung,

459
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 paying the penalty for the sin that you and I have committed

460
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 and rose again three days later.

461
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 You see, every time that Jesus resisted temptation,

462
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 He paid the penalty for when you and I didn't.

463
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Because God's Word says that if you and I believe,

464
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 believe in our hearts and confess with our mouth

465
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 that Jesus is Lord, that He really is enough,

466
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 that I don't have to continue living this way.

467
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Jesus, I believe that you are enough.

468
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 It says we will be saved.

469
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Yes, for all of eternity, but it also says that

470
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 He will send the Holy Spirit to live inside of us

471
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 that will help enable us to reject the lies

472
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 and reject the temptations we're tempted to believe.

473
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 So you see, every time that Jesus was mocked,

474
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 every time that He was whipped,

475
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 every second that He hung on the cross,

476
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 He was resisting the temptation to not make it all end,

477
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 right there, because He could have,

478
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 but He didn't for you and for me.

479
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He resisted for us so that today, you and I,

480
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 we can resist, and that by grace, through faith,

481
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 we can be saved from the punishment

482
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 from the sins that we deserve.

483
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Pray for us.

484
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Father, thank you for how big you are.

485
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Thanks for how good you are,

486
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 and the fact that you really are for our greatest good.

487
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Father, I just ask that you open the eyes of our hearts

488
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 just to recognize that,

489
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 to recognize that we often want to believe

490
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 that we've got it figured out,

491
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 that we should be the God of our own lives.

492
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And for every time that temptation hits us

493
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 and we look at something,

494
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 we choose ultimately to go a way different than yours,

495
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 that we choose something opposite

496
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 of what you would want from us, Father,

497
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 that you aren't looking at us, you're not mad at us,

498
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 but you love us.

499
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And pray for all of my sins,

500
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 or all of my friends in the room tonight, Father,

501
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 that I don't know what they're walking in with,

502
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 what's going on inside of their hearts, Father,

503
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 but if there's anything there, Father,

504
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 where they're feeling shame

505
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 about the choices that they've made

506
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 or the things that they've done,

507
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 that they would look to you,

508
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 they would look to you

509
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 to be the one that heals them from that,

510
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 that brings them in and says, "I love you.

511
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 "It's okay, I know there is a better way."

512
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Thank you for Jesus and the example that he is in our lives.

513
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 We love you a lot, Satan, and I pray.

514
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Amen.

515
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:41,000
