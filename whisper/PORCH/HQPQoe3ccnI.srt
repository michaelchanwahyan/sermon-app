00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,000
 We are -- not sure what that was, but we are wrapping up this series, his and hers,

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,120
 and finishing up a conversation about dating.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,840
 On the topic of dating, this week marks an interesting week for myself and my wife because

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,520
 10 years ago this week, we got married.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,360
 Here's a -- yeah, thank you.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
 Thank you.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,400
 Here's a picture of our wedding.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,680
 JP actually did the wedding.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,960
 It was 10 years ago, fun fact.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,880
 It was the first ever Shane and Shane Porch Christmas concert.

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,240
 So they like popped over there.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,960
 Shane took his hat off, sang a song, came back over.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
 It was a blast.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,000
 We got married.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,080
 And so to celebrate for 10 years, you got to go big.

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,600
 So I did what any person would do.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,480
 I booked a 10-year anniversary trip through Costco.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
 Okay?

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
 Yes.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,500
 They don't just sell paper towels.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,520
 You can also go to Paris and Rome.

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,480
 Now when I booked this trip, true story, I didn't know quite what to expect.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,760
 I was basically the guinea pig of this whole operation because I didn't know anyone who

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,360
 had ever done Costco travel before.

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,620
 You walk by it if you've ever gone to Costco.

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,480
 It's right there in these little pamphlets.

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 And I was like, man, interesting.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,440
 And I'm kind of a sucker for a deal.

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,600
 And I typed in the price and it was shocking.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,200
 It was like certainly this is a down payment or something.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
 This is not the entire thing.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
 And it was.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,320
 So I didn't know if this was going to be amazing or you get what you pay for and I'm going

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,600
 to have the -- I'm the guy that's telling this story for the rest of his life.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,560
 So on our 10-year anniversary, get this one, I booked a Costco trip and just living with

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
 that.

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
 But it was amazing.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,920
 And we went for the last week or a week ago, we went for seven days to Paris and Rome and

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,540
 I'd never been there before.

48
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,880
 And so I just went full sin in research mode to make sure we maximized our time.

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,640
 I'm reading books on the city of Rome.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,760
 They've got podcasts out there that you can download and listen to.

51
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,480
 And I just went full sin to make sure that I took advantage of this one shot we had,

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,400
 potentially maybe ever, to see some of the most incredible cities on earth.

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,560
 Now what does that have to do with what we're talking about tonight?

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,800
 Well we're in a series on dating and love and relationships.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,760
 And our hope in heart is to as best we can give you as much information from God's Word

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:24,400
 and truth and wisdom to help you succeed and have one amazing shot at this thing called

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,160
 marriage.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,200
 Which is the point and really what dating is meant to lead you and be a path towards.

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,680
 And so last week we opened up a conversation about the ladies and men, who to date and

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,160
 what she should look like and ladies, who to strive to be and what God's Word has to

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
 say.

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,200
 Tonight we're going to talk about the his and his and hers.

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
 Specifically to the ladies in the room.

64
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,880
 Any ladies in the room tonight?

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:02,440
 Who you should look for as it relates to a potential spouse.

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:12,080
 That this is the character and characteristics that you should make required for any guy

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
 who is going to date you.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,040
 And what I hope to do in the next 30 minutes is not to be down on the guys at all but rather

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,180
 to paint a picture of men for who to strive to be, who God calls us and I believe in you.

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,960
 You have got it through God's Spirit, living with God's people, you can be God's man.

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,360
 And I want to paint that picture and look at a passage in 1 Timothy chapter 3.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,200
 So if you have a Bible you can flip over to 1 Timothy chapter 3.

73
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Here's what we know about 1 Timothy.

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,720
 It was written to Timothy by the Apostle Paul.

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,560
 And Paul writes and he gives instructions on what the leaders of a church should look

76
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,720
 like.

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,200
 Now what does it have to do with dating and love?

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,320
 Well the Bible says that God calls the church his bride.

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:05,240
 In other words, when God says here's the type of men I want to lead my bride, the church,

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,200
 he gives us really a blueprint for what men in general we should strive for.

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,880
 In other words, if this is the type of man that God says is qualified to lead his bride,

82
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,240
 it's also the type of man that can lead you as a bride.

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,480
 Or in being and pursuing allows you to be someone worthy of leading a bride, not the

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,320
 church bride but a wife.

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,760
 So we're going to look at six characteristics from this passage.

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,520
 I'm going to read all the way through it and then pull out six different things to strive

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 for to look at what God calls ladies, you to look for in a husband and us as men to

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,640
 pursue and prioritize becoming.

89
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,880
 So 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 says this.

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,800
 Here is a trustworthy saying.

91
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,760
 Whoever aspires to be an overseer or I may say elder, it's the same word there, it's

92
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
 just a leader within the church.

93
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,040
 That's all that that means.

94
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,800
 Desires a noble task.

95
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,000
 That's a good thing.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,740
 Now the overseer or the leader of my bride, the church, must be above reproach.

97
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,400
 He's faithful to his wife.

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,600
 He's temperate, self-controlled.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,160
 He's respectable.

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,220
 He's hospitable or welcoming and warm.

101
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,800
 He's able to teach.

102
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,600
 He knows God's word and he's able to teach it.

103
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,120
 He's not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome,

104
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,200
 not a lover of money.

105
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,120
 He must manage his own family well, as in he leads his family well,

106
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,360
 and see that his children obey him.

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,560
 And he must do so in a manner worthy of full of respect.

108
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,560
 If anyone does not know how to manage his own house or his own family,

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,240
 how can he take care of God's church?

110
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,560
 He must not be a recent convert or he may become conceited or arrogant and fall

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,880
 into the same judgment as the devil.

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,160
 He must have a good reputation with outsiders.

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,480
 That he has a reputation that is positive even among non-believers.

114
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,840
 So that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,200
 Now there's a lot of characteristics and really what I want to do is succinctly

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,800
 put them into six different criteria that men, whatever and wherever you are

117
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,880
 at in your journey, today you can start pursuing and becoming.

118
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,400
 And so we're going to look at six different things directly from this text

119
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,720
 as it relates to the type of husband to look for.

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,520
 In other words, if you're dating somebody and they don't have these

121
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,440
 characteristics, that should be concerning.

122
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,320
 And the type of person that you should allow to date and have a relationship

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,560
 with you, if you're a lady, should have these characteristics.

124
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,480
 We're going to talk through these six.

125
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,120
 So the first one that you should examine, all six of them are things that,

126
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,560
 hey, if you're in the dating time, this is the process of evaluating,

127
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,720
 is this a person I want to continue on this path called dating towards marriage?

128
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
 And I need to examine these six things.

129
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,800
 The first thing that you need to examine is his commitments.

130
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
 His commitments.

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,080
 Every guy in the room is committed to a lot of different things.

132
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
 Some of them committed to cowboys, Dallas Cowboys.

133
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,120
 Some are committed to their jobs.

134
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,880
 Some are committed to, you know, call of duty.

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,240
 Some are committed to a myriad of different things.

136
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,080
 But specifically, evaluate his commitments to the local church and his commitment

137
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,360
 to the covenant of marriage.

138
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,480
 And I'm going to unpack both of those.

139
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,400
 But the first one, is he committed to a local church?

140
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,240
 The scriptures command that you and I are to be connected to a body,

141
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
 a local church, not at the porch.

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,520
 The porch is not a church.

143
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,800
 It's a ministry within Watermark, which is our church, my church.

144
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,960
 That you are to be connected to a local church in order so they can control you?

145
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,800
 No, because it's one of God's ways of caring and protecting and caring for you.

146
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
 Are they committed and listening to God's word saying, "Man,

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,360
 I'm going to be connected to a local church.

148
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,440
 I'm going to live in community with other guys.

149
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,600
 I'm going to walk openly and honestly about where I'm struggling,

150
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,320
 where I could use prayer with other guys."

151
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,400
 In Hebrews 13, verse 17, it describes teaching and the role that really elders,

152
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,280
 which Watermark has elders, church leadership, they're to play in caring

153
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,680
 for the people that God has a part of their church community.

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,280
 It says this, "Have confidence in your leaders.

155
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,160
 Submit, listen to their authority because they keep watch over you as those who must

156
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,840
 give an account.

157
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,360
 Do this so their work will be a joy and not a burden, for that would be of no

158
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,960
 benefit to you."

159
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,440
 The Bible just said, hey, that at the end of life, at the end when Jesus

160
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,520
 returns in eternity, elders and leaders within a local church are going to give

161
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,000
 an account for the people that made up their local church.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,760
 Are you connected to a local church?

163
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,040
 It's there that you're going to receive care, accountability, encouragement.

164
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,960
 One of the greatest sources of blessing to my life, to my wife,

165
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,520
 to our world or my world is my community group that we've been with eight years,

166
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,480
 that we meet every single week, sometimes multiple times a week.

167
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
 They know where I need prayer.

168
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,320
 They know where I need to improve or do better or love my wife better.

169
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:37,400
 They know the struggles and temptations that I face, and they provide care and are

170
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,800
 a source of God's provision.

171
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,160
 If you're dating somebody, and for whatever reason, and there's going to be a

172
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,960
 lot of excuses.

173
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,840
 They're going to say, "Oh, you know, I listen to a lot of the podcasts,

174
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,480
 and I really like to stream church from home, and I like to check out a number

175
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,200
 of different churches."

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,800
 Like, if I was to talk to you down front, you have a reason why you're not

177
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 connected to the church.

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,440
 It's just not a good one or a biblical one.

179
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,160
 And God says, you and I are to be connected to a local body as a source of

180
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,560
 receiving care, encouragement, and support.

181
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,680
 And quite frankly, it allows other people to know you, like really know you.

182
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,920
 Like, man, if you came down front and you asked me to pray for you,

183
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,800
 I'd love to pray for you, but I don't know you.

184
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,040
 I don't know the ins and outs of your life.

185
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,920
 But here, and at a local church, you can get known and cared for and allow

186
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,680
 other people to see into your life and see, quite frankly, blind spots.

187
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,200
 You have, you don't even realize you have them.

188
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,840
 It's like this.

189
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,760
 When I was 22, for the first time, when I came on staff at Watermark,

190
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
 I'd never had dental care before.

191
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,280
 So, I never went to the dentist.

192
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,080
 22 years growing up.

193
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,560
 I know, it's shocking.

194
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,880
 And I go to the dentist, and it was the first time I was like, "This is cool.

195
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,960
 I get to go to the dentist, sit back in this comfortable chair,

196
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,600
 and, you know, experience the whole nine yards."

197
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,880
 And she comes in, does X-rays, and I'm like, "That's cool.

198
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 They're doing X-rays."

199
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,360
 My mom just, for whatever reason, she was like, "Your teeth are straight.

200
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,080
 Get back in the game."

201
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,200
 So, that's how we lived.

202
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,440
 And I get the X-rays, and he comes out and says, "Man, your teeth are straight.

203
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,560
 That's great.

204
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,000
 You have 14 cavities."

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,840
 I know.

206
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,440
 I was like, "What?"

207
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,120
 And he begins to ask questions like, "How much soda are you drinking?

208
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,280
 You know, how often are you brushing, flossing?

209
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,040
 Are you sleeping with candy in your mouth?

210
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,280
 What is causing this?"

211
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:31,440
 And he was able to see an area of my life that due to just habits or not proper

212
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,120
 dental hygiene was creating problems and decay.

213
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,680
 And in a very similar way, it's inside of the church that not we open up,

214
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,360
 you know, your mouth for dental procedure, you open up your life and you allow people

215
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:53,440
 to speak into and to see the dysfunctional behavior and dating that you have and speak

216
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,240
 to it from God's word, not to, you know, shame you or hurt you,

217
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,800
 but to care for you, help you, that we benefit from others in our life

218
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,480
 as God's protection and provision of care.

219
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,960
 The second thing he needs to make sure, and I'm going to move quicker through the

220
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,760
 rest of these, is that he is committed to the covenant of marriage.

221
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,280
 This is really important, okay?

222
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,840
 If you miss everything else that I say and you hold on to this,

223
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,880
 it'll be worth your time.

224
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,120
 Marriage is not a contract.

225
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,840
 What's a contract?

226
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,080
 Do you have a contract with AT&C or Spectrum?

227
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,800
 Contract is you give me certain services, and as long as you maintain that,

228
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,040
 I give you a certain fee.

229
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
 It's not a contract.

230
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,320
 That's not what marriage is.

231
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,240
 It's not a commitment.

232
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,480
 It's not simply a commitment.

233
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
 In other words, it's not just, "You know what?

234
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
 I'm committed to this."

235
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,560
 Marriage, biblically, for Christians is a covenant.

236
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,720
 What's a covenant?

237
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,600
 A covenant is a relationship that two people voluntarily enter into that only

238
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,200
 ends in death.

239
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,920
 Is the person you're dating of a mindset that, "Hey, marriage is not something that

240
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,960
 we just try, and if it doesn't work, you know, we'll figure something out."

241
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,600
 No, marriage is a covenant.

242
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,920
 And when we stand before one another and make crazy promises, you know,

243
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,320
 that's what they do at a wedding.

244
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,840
 I mean, promises that are extraordinary.

245
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,000
 "Hey, I am with you for better or worse, sickness and in health,

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,800
 richer or poorer, whatever comes in front of us until death do us part."

247
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,080
 Are they committed to the covenant of marriage?

248
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,800
 How do you know?

249
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
 Ready?

250
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
 You ask them.

251
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,240
 What do you think about marriage?

252
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,160
 What do you believe about it?

253
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,840
 And if they say, "You know, as long as the person stays in a certain

254
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,120
 fitness level and does everything that I want, then I'm married," you run for the

255
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,320
 hills and you go red flag, red flag, red flag because they don't understand what

256
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,200
 marriage is.

257
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,080
 Marriage is a lifelong covenant.

258
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
 Every couple that I've ever done marriage counseling with or done their wedding will

259
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,280
 do two-on-two counseling, and I'll ask the same question.

260
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,000
 "Is there any situation in which you would divorce Kyle, you would leave Lisa?"

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,480
 They always say the same thing.

262
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
 "Oh, no, no."

263
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,120
 Okay.

264
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,360
 If Lisa ends up sleeping with your cousin and runs off to the Himalayas,

265
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,600
 you're still in, you're chasing, you're pursuing, you're prioritizing

266
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
 caring for her.

267
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,200
 "Well, I mean, if she sleeps with my cousin and goes to the Himalayas,

268
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,240
 that's a whole different thing."

269
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,720
 Okay, great.

270
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,840
 I'm going to write that one down, okay?

271
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,320
 We're going to put these in the vows, "Until death do us part," or "Until you

272
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,600
 sleep with my cousin and you run off to the Himalayas."

273
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
 I mean, that's the truth.

274
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 Grandma's not going to like it on the second row, but that's the truth.

275
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,720
 And so, let's be honest.

276
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,360
 Is the person you're dating committed to the covenant of marriage?

277
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,320
 Jesus in Matthew 19, we don't have time to look at all of it.

278
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,720
 He says something and he teaches on marriage, and he says, "It was never meant

279
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,520
 to be something that could break.

280
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 It's a lifelong commitment."

281
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:52,920
 And it was so breathtaking to the disciples, they said, "If that's the case,

282
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,240
 maybe better to not get married."

283
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,520
 And Jesus doesn't say, "Oh, no, no, no, no.

284
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
 Marriage is amazing.

285
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,880
 Yes, it's amazing."

286
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:09,040
 He says, "Everyone who can accept this should accept this teaching."

287
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,840
 It's God's design, this lifelong covenant together.

288
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,440
 Is he committed to the covenant of marriage?

289
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,120
 Number two, you want to examine his humility.

290
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,640
 His humility.

291
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,440
 What is humility?

292
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,680
 Humility is not thinking less of yourself as though he's always putting himself

293
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,480
 down or he has low self-esteem.

294
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,680
 That's not humility.

295
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,880
 That can actually be pride because it's still focused on self.

296
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,360
 It's not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking about yourself less,

297
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,720
 that he's constantly focused and concerned about other people around him.

298
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,440
 Is his life marked with humility?

299
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,680
 1 Peter 5 says, "Everyone should clothe themselves like you daily get up."

300
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,560
 And as my friend says, "I want to wear humility as I walk

301
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,280
 into whatever meetings, whatever is in front of me today."

302
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,680
 What does humility look like?

303
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,480
 It looks like, "I'm going to ask for forgiveness.

304
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,760
 I'm going to own my part.

305
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,120
 I'm going to move in their direction.

306
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,280
 That when I'm wrong, I want to say I was wrong.

307
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,880
 I want to have a teachable spirit and not assume that I can't learn."

308
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,880
 The Scripture says in this text, it says, "That he must not be a recent convert,"

309
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,800
 and he's talking about leaders in the church, "because of the danger of being

310
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,840
 conceited or arrogant and falling under the same judgment as the devil."

311
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,920
 The devil, we know in Scripture, is the ruler of evil and darkness inside

312
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 of this world, but at one point, he was an angel.

313
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,360
 Scripture say that he was cast out from heaven.

314
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,000
 Why?

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,640
 Well, when he was an angel, he didn't want to worship God.

316
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,400
 He wanted to be worshiped as God.

317
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
 Pride is the person that you are dating.

318
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,760
 Does humility mark their life?

319
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,640
 Perhaps of the whole list, this is one of the more important ones,

320
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,640
 because without humility, you won't get connected to a church.

321
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,160
 Without humility, you're not going to be willing to listen to other people.

322
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
 Without humility, you're not going to be willing to say, "You know,

323
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 I think I was wrong."

324
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
 Does humility mark their life?

325
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,160
 What's interesting, ladies, and let me just pick a little bit on ladies,

326
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:20,760
 there is something that consistently women will find themselves attracted

327
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,960
 to the arrogant, cocky jerk.

328
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,200
 And I don't know what it is, and it's puzzling.

329
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,640
 And, you know, you go back through all the way back to high school

330
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
 and the quarterback that just was all arrogance.

331
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,560
 And there's something that ladies can find attractive.

332
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,840
 That quality will not be something you find attractive in marriage.

333
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,640
 It'll be something that drives a wedge in your relationship.

334
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,560
 On the flip side, humility is something that always looks good on everybody,

335
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,600
 and will always look good.

336
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,760
 In other words, humility, it's the little black dress.

337
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,040
 It's the thing you go in, looks good every single time.

338
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,840
 In fact, men, let me just say this to you.

339
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,880
 If, you know, you got a face made for radio, you can be more attractive today.

340
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,160
 Some of you guys are just getting that right now.

341
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,760
 You will be more attractive today if you are humble.

342
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,760
 You can, man, if you will learn and practice humility overnight,

343
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,560
 you are immediately, because humility looks good on everybody.

344
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,840
 You need to examine their humility.

345
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,880
 Is their life marked with humility?

346
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,240
 Number three, examine their reputation.

347
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,400
 If humility is one of the most important, their reputation, candidly, ladies,

348
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,560
 is one of the ones that often is most overlooked or neglected or excused away.

349
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,320
 You need to examine his reputation.

350
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,560
 The scripture says, in this passage we read, he must have a good reputation

351
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,680
 with outsiders.

352
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,760
 Not even just within the church, he's well thought of and respected.

353
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,120
 Even with outsiders, when he's at work, when he's around non-believing family

354
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
 members, they speak well of him.

355
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,800
 What is the reputation of the guy or girl, but in this case,

356
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,600
 the guy that you're dating?

357
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,160
 The good news is no matter what your reputation, if you've blown every single

358
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,720
 one in this list, God isn't done with you.

359
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,280
 He can still write an amazing story.

360
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,840
 But what is the reputation?

361
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,320
 Is he known for being flaky?

362
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,920
 Is he known for not keeping his word when he says he's going to do something?

363
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,560
 Or is he known for being generous and kind?

364
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,240
 He's known as the guy who shows up to serve and help when somebody

365
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,920
 needs to move.

366
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,000
 He's known as the guy who constantly is giving friends rides to the airport.

367
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
 He's known as the guy that is always looking out for family members and needs

368
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,400
 that they have.

369
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,520
 What is his reputation, for good or for worse?

370
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,200
 Is he a known commodity?

371
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,920
 One of the ways that you can know his reputation is by being in an environment

372
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,200
 where he's known.

373
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,320
 This goes back to the first point of being connected to a local church,

374
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,880
 that he's known by people in his life.

375
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,520
 And he's not a perfect guy by any means, but people know him and his reputation

376
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,760
 is one that is good with believers and non-believers.

377
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,520
 What is the reputation that he has?

378
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,960
 This is, candidly, why online dating is so dangerous.

379
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,880
 And it's the number one way that people meet today.

380
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,840
 But the reason it can be dangerous is anybody can look good over a cup of

381
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,200
 coffee and in their Instagram profile or their online dating or their Hinge or

382
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:37,400
 their Bumble or whatever profile, but you don't actually know them.

383
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,760
 Versus if they're connected and have other believers and they have roots

384
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,560
 inside of a church and a reputation that goes before them.

385
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,200
 Whenever we were in Europe, I would go onto TripAdvisor and I would

386
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,800
 evaluate everything that...anything that we were going to do or any place we're

387
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,360
 going to stay, man, I wanted to go look at the good, the bad,

388
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,720
 and the ugly of every place.

389
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
 So I just went, again, full tilt.

390
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,440
 I'm in there reading the reviews.

391
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,920
 I want to know the recent bad ones, not just all the glowing ones that

392
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,120
 somebody in the hotel staff wrote themselves.

393
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,080
 I want to know, like, the crazy Karen Josiah mentioned, what is she saying?

394
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,680
 I want to know the good, the bad, the ugly, everything about it.

395
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,440
 So I go in with eyes wide open.

396
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,000
 In the process of dating, it is evaluating.

397
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,680
 It is them interviewing for the position of husband, interviewing for the position

398
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,320
 of your children's father.

399
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:37,440
 You cannot be too careful and take serious or take too seriously knowing who they are

400
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,280
 and the person that you're dating them.

401
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,360
 What is their reputation?

402
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,480
 You need to examine what are they known for by the people in their life.

403
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,600
 If they have a reputation, just like in that scenario where you go

404
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,080
 on TripAdvisor and you see, "Oh, man, this hotel, there's a number

405
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,040
 of different bad reviews."

406
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,200
 You know what the good thing about that scenario with that hotel?

407
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,400
 You can get new management.

408
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,520
 You can make decisions and all of a sudden operate in a different way,

409
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,680
 and those reviews begin to change.

410
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,920
 You can begin to see, "Oh, man, they really started to operate

411
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,640
 things differently."

412
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,120
 The same thing is true in life.

413
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,760
 No matter what your reputation, you may have a string of bad relationship

414
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,600
 after relationship after relationship and ways that you blew it, man.

415
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,360
 God isn't done with you.

416
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,280
 And if you surrender to Him and walk with Him, He can begin to rewrite that story.

417
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
 I believe in you.

418
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,400
 You can do it, but you have got to decide, "I'm going to trust God's way."

419
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,320
 What is his reputation?

420
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,800
 All right, number four, examine does he have initiative?

421
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,240
 Does he take initiative?

422
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,680
 He initiates.

423
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,400
 He has drive.

424
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,480
 He is not constantly or just simply spending every waking moment playing

425
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,640
 Fortnite.

426
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,040
 He has initiative, specifically in the context of leading and leading

427
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,080
 in a dating way.

428
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,120
 The Scripture says in this passage, it says, "He must be able to manage his

429
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,440
 own family well."

430
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,680
 It's talking about leadership in the home.

431
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,960
 You're looking for somebody who can lead your family and be a part of initiating

432
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,320
 and leading and caring for your future home.

433
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,080
 Does he have initiative?

434
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,360
 Biblically, leadership is synonymous with serving.

435
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,360
 Jesus would say that in Mark 10.

436
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,320
 Biblical leadership is chief servant.

437
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,000
 And having initiative is one of the ways, men, that you can serve her.

438
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,240
 What do I mean?

439
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,000
 It looks like this.

440
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,040
 What does it look like to show initiative?

441
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,000
 It means that you initiate the date.

442
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,200
 It means you go up to her, and this is going to be scary because, ladies,

443
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,440
 you don't realize it, you're scary.

444
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,400
 You got all the earrings and nails and all this stuff, and guys are...

445
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,440
 They look tough on the outside, but there's a little part,

446
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,280
 it's just intimidating.

447
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,080
 And you're going to go up despite that intimidation.

448
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,280
 You know what you're going to do, men?

449
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,720
 You're going to flex the courage muscle, and you're going to go up to her,

450
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,120
 and you're going to say, "Hey, Karen."

451
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,120
 It's like a third Karen reference tonight.

452
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,680
 I apologize.

453
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,960
 Whatever your name is, I would like to take you on a date this Saturday

454
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,400
 to the Mavericks game.

455
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
 Or...I got all the Mavs fans, good.

456
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,640
 I would like to take you out to dinner this weekend to go to the Perot Museum.

457
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,200
 I would like to take you out for coffee this Sunday afternoon.

458
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,480
 You're very specific.

459
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,680
 I would like to take you on a date, and then you fill in the blank showing

460
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,520
 that you are prepared, you have a plan, you're showing initiative,

461
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,360
 you're giving clarity on exactly the ask.

462
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,440
 We talked about it a few weeks ago.

463
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,800
 You don't just go up and say, "Hey, you got anything going Saturday,

464
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,880
 or you want to chill?"

465
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,680
 You say, "I'd like to take you on a date, and here's what I'd like to do."

466
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,240
 Then you give her a chance to respond.

467
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,560
 And if she doesn't have a response in that moment, you say, "It's okay,

468
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,280
 you can take time and let me know.

469
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,960
 I'd like to take you out on a date and get to know you better."

470
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,240
 You use your words and you initiate.

471
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,600
 Now, I answered this a couple of weeks ago, but let me come back to it.

472
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,960
 Ladies, can ladies ask guys on a date?

473
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
 - No.

474
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
 - Yes.

475
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:15,320
 - Sure.

476
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,640
 I mean, it depends what you mean.

477
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,120
 Like, if you ask them out, does that mean you're going to hell?

478
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,240
 No, that's not what the Bible...

479
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,560
 Is it best?

480
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,680
 Well, God said that man is to be the chief leader and sacrificer for his family

481
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,720
 and in his home.

482
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,840
 And already, it's the first opportunity to initiate that he's not even doing.

483
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
 It doesn't communicate his leadership.

484
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
 The other thing that you're going to do, and this shows initiative,

485
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,400
 is all throughout the dating process, you took her on a date, and then you're

486
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
 going to continue to bring clarity.

487
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,040
 So if you don't want to go on a second date, you don't just say,

488
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,080
 "I'd like to...I hope to see you again sometime," because that's not true.

489
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,840
 You tell the truth.

490
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,440
 If you do want to go on a second date, you say, "I've really enjoyed this

491
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,920
 first date.

492
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,440
 I'd love to take you on a second date."

493
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,600
 You never leave her wondering.

494
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,440
 Here's the truth.

495
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,560
 Ladies, they wonder.

496
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,600
 They're wondering.

497
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,880
 Guys, we just fixate on one thing.

498
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,920
 We're not even thinking about anything for, like, the entire day.

499
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,440
 But ladies, it's always going up there, and they're wondering,

500
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,200
 and you don't want to leave her wondering.

501
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,240
 And so you never want her to go, "I don't know what's going on with us,

502
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
 and is he interested, or he's kind of giving me just confusing vibes."

503
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,880
 None of that happens.

504
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,880
 You drive clarity because you're a man who's going to step up and show

505
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,640
 initiative and communicate.

506
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,240
 I would like you to be my girlfriend.

507
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,040
 When that moment comes, you're driving clarity into the relationship.

508
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,160
 If you're not sure the relationship should go forward, you communicate

509
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,560
 that with her.

510
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,520
 And you, all along the way, are showing initiative in how you lead and bring

511
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,080
 clarity to the relationship.

512
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,840
 We've said before, leaders remove confusion.

513
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,680
 You're going to remove any confusion because we don't play games.

514
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,240
 Games are for kids.

515
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,440
 You're a follower of Jesus and a godly, pursuing being a godly man,

516
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,360
 and you're going to lead her in that way.

517
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,200
 This also means leading her in purity.

518
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,400
 You're going to honor God by prioritizing maintaining sexual boundaries.

519
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,880
 I'm going to honor you and honor God by leading you in purity.

520
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,320
 Now, let me answer this question because there's a lot of confusion around,

521
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,560
 like, "Hey, women are..."

522
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,720
 Do you submit to the guy that you're dating?

523
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,880
 Ready?

524
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,040
 No.

525
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:19,320
 Scripture says that wives submit to a husband as husbands submit to the Lord.

526
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,520
 So, until he puts a ring on it, and until he is in the position of,

527
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,240
 "Hey, I..."

528
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,840
 Because the Scripture also says, "Guys, you're called to die daily

529
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,280
 for your wife."

530
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,480
 Until he's in that position, you're not in the position of submitting

531
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
 to anything.

532
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,600
 And his role is to be the chief servant in how he leads and cares and initiates

533
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,160
 with you in this time and in the marriage.

534
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,040
 All right, number five, examine his self-control.

535
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,920
 The passage we read talks about at least three areas, but several areas,

536
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 that he, as a leader of a bride, should exhibit self-control.

537
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,880
 And he brings up three areas.

538
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,320
 It says, he's faithful to his wife, he's self-controlled,

539
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,880
 he's not given to drunkenness, he's not violent but gentle.

540
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,560
 So, here's three areas to evaluate, alcohol, anger, and adultery.

541
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,760
 Alcohol, anger, and adultery.

542
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,320
 If he is getting drunk in front of you, that's a red flag.

543
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,760
 And maybe the reason you don't see it that way is because you're getting drunk

544
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,400
 in front of him.

545
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,600
 And it's just kind of part of your relationship.

546
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,160
 That is a reflection of red flags in both directions.

547
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,080
 Does he exercise self-control as it relates to anger?

548
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,640
 Like, if he is getting in fights at the bar over the latest, you know,

549
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,480
 Cowboys game, that's a big red flag.

550
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,480
 You are so valuable, God would die on a cross for you.

551
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:52,040
 Staying in a relationship with somebody who is belligerent in acting out in his

552
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,080
 anger, it's not worth your time.

553
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,160
 And that sounds not gracious.

554
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,360
 My point is to not be gracious.

555
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,540
 It's you are deciding.

556
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:07,120
 You can extend him grace and forgiveness, but not your hand in marriage.

557
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,960
 Because you're evaluating, is this the spouse and father and husband that I want

558
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,560
 to commit my life to?

559
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,960
 And then he brings up adultery, that he's faithful to his wife.

560
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,080
 Like, people will write in and ask, or ask the question, "Hey,

561
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,120
 my boyfriend cheated on me.

562
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,400
 What should I do?"

563
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,960
 Let me give the answer.

564
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
 Ready?

565
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,280
 You break up with him.

566
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,560
 You break up with him.

567
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,240
 He has shown that he's not in a healthy place, and you can pray for him and hope

568
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,160
 that he gets to a place where he's not cheating on anybody with anybody.

569
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,800
 But you don't date him.

570
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,640
 You don't move towards marriage with him.

571
00:30:51,640 --> 00:31:01,000
 If he is looking at porn consistently, you should break the relationship and take

572
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 time to get healthy.

573
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,760
 And, man, pornography is a big part of my story for years.

574
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,240
 And the opportunities to get healthy, they're all around here,

575
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,960
 going to Regen, signing up for Covenant Eyes, and getting it placed on your phone

576
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,360
 to struggle well so that you're not training yourself for variety,

577
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,800
 which is what pornography does.

578
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,440
 And you're exhibiting self-control.

579
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,280
 If he's pushing and pressuring you to go physically farther than God's word says,

580
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,200
 that's a red flag.

581
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,640
 Is he exhibiting and exercising self-control?

582
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,720
 Because if he's not right now and you're dating, what makes you think he will

583
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,840
 when you're married?

584
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,760
 If he's not right now saying, "Hey, I have the ability to not sleep with

585
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:52,120
 someone who's not my wife," what's going to magically turn that ability off

586
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,320
 whenever you guys get married?

587
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,240
 Then he's going to exercise self-control?

588
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,400
 In other words, right now, you're evaluating the pattern of their

589
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,200
 life, which is a far more in the path that their life is on.

590
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,800
 It's a far greater indicator than a promise that they're going to make.

591
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,440
 People can make promises all the time.

592
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,400
 What's much more powerful is the path that their life is on.

593
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,960
 In other words, right now, the World Cup is going on.

594
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,080
 USA Today, did anyone not see?

595
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,800
 Anyone know the score?

596
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,520
 I'm about to ruin it, so close your ears.

597
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,200
 Okay, ready?

598
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,960
 USA Today beats Iran, takes them down 1-0 on the path to victory.

599
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,280
 Now, Iran, despite having lost, they could say, "Hey, no,

600
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,800
 but we promise we are going to win the World Cup."

601
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,280
 What is a much more important variable or factor or determining factor if that's

602
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,520
 going to happen is not the promise they make, it is the path they are on.

603
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,840
 And in the same way, he can sit there and he can make promises about how he'll be,

604
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,600
 and what he'll be, and what it'll be like all day long.

605
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,000
 The promise is not nearly as powerful as the path that his life is on.

606
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,320
 It's the path of his life, one that is moving in the direction

607
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,200
 that Christ says godly men should be moving.

608
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,440
 And is he exercising self-control.

609
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,320
 All right, number six, his trust in God.

610
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:27,640
 Evaluate his trust in God, that he really believes God's word.

611
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,080
 When it comes to living his life and how he thinks about money,

612
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,640
 how he sees the future, how he thinks about children in the home,

613
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,560
 how he understands marriage in general, is all of that informed by God's word

614
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,440
 or his opinions?

615
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,640
 Like, does he actually...I mean it, does he trust God's word?

616
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,240
 I'm going to live and look to God's word for direction.

617
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,240
 It says that he has to be able to teach it so that he can teach children and teach

618
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,280
 God's word, which means he needs to know God's word and live by God's word,

619
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,040
 which means he trusts God's word.

620
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,840
 Examine his trust in God, that he trusts God.

621
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,000
 In Titus 1, it's a very similar passage, covers elders as well.

622
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,240
 It says, "Leaders of God's bride must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it's

623
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,560
 been taught so he can encourage others with sound doctrine and refute those

624
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,240
 who oppose it."

625
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,120
 That when it comes to life, he's constantly going to God's word and

626
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,360
 saying, "Man, hey, this is how I naturally think about it,

627
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,200
 but this is really what God's word says about X topic.

628
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,280
 This is how I naturally think about love, sex, dating, but this is what God's

629
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,000
 word says.

630
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,080
 This is how I think about my job and my boss, but this is what God's word says."

631
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,280
 He's constantly looking to it for direction.

632
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,760
 When we were in Paris, we would take the metro, which is the subway,

633
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,360
 basically, of Paris.

634
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,000
 And we were on such a tight schedule, like I said, because I packed everything

635
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,920
 in there, that I would carry around with me this map of the metro station because I

636
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,800
 always wanted to make sure we got on the right line to go to the right destination.

637
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,120
 In other words, I didn't just, you know, pull out the map and go,

638
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,160
 "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, pick a tiger by its toe," this one.

639
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,800
 And then we'd go to wherever it ended up.

640
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,080
 I didn't go off of my own perspective and, I mean, I just like the color

641
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,120
 of that railway.

642
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,120
 I would look at the map because if I want to end up at the right destination,

643
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:35,080
 I have to make sure that I get on the thing that is moving in the right direction.

644
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,520
 I follow the directions.

645
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:42,360
 Does he look to God's word as his guide, source of direction?

646
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,400
 Or does he look to the opinions of friends and the world around him?

647
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,480
 Or does he trust God's word?

648
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,160
 In other words, you're looking for someone who's committed to the church,

649
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,960
 who's marked by humility, whose reputation is one that brings

650
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,600
 honor to God and to himself, has initiative, has self-control,

651
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,760
 and trusts God's word.

652
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,680
 You're looking for someone who's in relationship with Christ,

653
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,720
 who is walking with Christ.

654
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,040
 You're not going to find a perfect husband.

655
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
 There is no perfect husband.

656
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,260
 There's no perfect man.

657
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,760
 There is only one who's ever lived, Jesus.

658
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,600
 But the closer in relationship that he is to Christ and the more intimately that he

659
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,840
 walks with him, the more that he will exhibit all of those

660
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,920
 characteristics.

661
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:40,640
 And you're looking for somebody who is in relationship, walking daily with Christ.

662
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,000
 To be the leader of God's bride, God says, that's what it takes.

663
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,880
 And to be the leader of you as a bride.

664
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
 These are the things to look for.

665
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,240
 And quite frankly, this is not a message of going, "Guys, hey,

666
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,000
 pull your bootstraps up and try a lot harder."

667
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,360
 This is a message of walking in dependence on Christ.

668
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,240
 That's the only way that anything that looks like Christ begins to show up in any

669
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,200
 of our lives is by walking in dependence on you, Jesus.

670
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,520
 I need your help to be the husband that I want to be, to keep my commitments the way

671
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,400
 that I want to, to be marked in humility.

672
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,920
 None of that comes from me, just like none of it comes from you.

673
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,400
 It comes from walking in dependence on Christ.

674
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,800
 And if you've never had a moment where you trusted in Jesus as your savior,

675
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
 you don't have a relationship with Christ.

676
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,120
 You don't have eternal life, to be quite frankly.

677
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,520
 And your moment tonight is not to try to keep commitments and get plugged

678
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,200
 into a church, it's to accept Jesus as your savior, the savior of the world who

679
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,000
 died for your sin.

680
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,160
 That's what it means to be a Christian.

681
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,840
 You know that, right?

682
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,920
 The message of Christianity is not try harder and let's all get a motivational

683
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,160
 speech and you can go out there and you're going to do great this week.

684
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,240
 The message of Christianity is there are no good people.

685
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,480
 It's not good people in heaven, bad people in hell.

686
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,720
 It is forgiven people who go to heaven.

687
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,800
 Only way you and I can be forgiven is by trusting Jesus as your savior,

688
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,360
 the payment for your sin, that he died in your place and he rose again showing the

689
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
 payment was more than enough.

690
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,200
 Check cleared, all went through.

691
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,360
 Everything you've ever done, paid for.

692
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,600
 And that allows you a relationship with Christ and that's how God begins to bring

693
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,680
 about these qualities and characteristic.

694
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,560
 No matter where you are, if you look at all of these and you're like,

695
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,280
 "I've blown it on each one of those," God is not done with you.

696
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,280
 You've got to trust him, surrender to him.

697
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:27,440
 So I'm going to walk with you to the ladies in the room who have faithfully been

698
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:36,280
 following Jesus, who have prioritized God's word, pursued purity,

699
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,800
 not settled and lowered your standards.

700
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,720
 I want you to hear from me, I am so proud of you.

701
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,160
 To the godly men in the room who have walked with Jesus,

702
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,960
 who are striving imperfectly like we all are to be God's man,

703
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,120
 I am so proud of you.

704
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,000
 And if you're in a place where ladies, you're just going, "Man,

705
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,200
 I've done those things," but it's just guys that are not asking me out.

706
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,920
 I have a four-year-old daughter.

707
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,440
 And for her to grow up and have all the beauty and the clothes and the car and

708
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,400
 the looks and everything the world says, but not have what you have,

709
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,360
 as a godly woman who says, "I trust God and I'm not going to settle for what

710
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,320
 other people in the world around me are settling for.

711
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,920
 I'm not going to lower my standards because I know my worth,

712
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:31,200
 I know my value, I know whose identity or whose image I'm made in."

713
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,040
 I'm going to trust God.

714
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,360
 I am so proud of you.

715
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,920
 And if my daughter grows up to be like you, I will be so proud.

716
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,440
 Keep going.

717
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,280
 It's worth it.

718
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,640
 And men, no matter where you're at, God isn't done with you and you have a

719
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,080
 chance and I believe in you.

720
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,920
 Those of you who know Jesus and you're walking with him just like me

721
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,800
 imperfectly with other guys in your life, keep going.

722
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,000
 It's worth it.

723
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,280
 And in time, you'll see that relationship prioritized with Jesus, it was worth it.

724
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,200
 And you'll look more and more like Christ.

725
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,320
 Let me pray.

726
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:23,200
 Father, thank you just for the ways you come alongside all of us despite our

727
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,920
 imperfections, our need for you, and thank you that you rush in to love us

728
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,640
 and help us.

729
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,600
 I pray for the guys in the room who are seeking to follow you and honor you,

730
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,600
 that you would continue to deepen their love for you, their faith in you,

731
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,880
 their trust in you.

732
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:45,040
 I pray for the ladies in the room seeking to do the same, you would strengthen their

733
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,120
 resolve and they would live and walk deeply in relationship with you.

734
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,440
 Thank you that you loved us so much that you would give your life for us to have

735
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,240
 a relationship in this life with you and for all of eternity.

736
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,760
 For anyone tonight who has never accepted, believed, or received that with that

737
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:14,360
 change, and they step into the most important relationship they'll ever have,

738
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,040
 which is with you.

739
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,800
 We worship you now in song.

740
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,280
 Amen.

741
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,760
 You guys take a seat real quick.

742
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,360
 Oh, man.

743
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,600
 Thanks, dude.

744
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,040
 I think I'm good, actually.

745
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:37,280
 I'm here.

746
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:47,680
 In 2010, I got asked by somebody named Jonathan Picluda to come teach at the

747
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,800
 porch.

748
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,600
 And it was a very different day.

749
00:41:51,600 --> 00:42:00,320
 It was like there was 375 people and it was amazing.

750
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,800
 And since then, I've had the chance of seeing God just show up in unbelievable

751
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,440
 ways.

752
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,680
 And one of the greatest honors next to being Callie's husband and Monroe and Bear

753
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,400
 and Crew's dad has been having just a front row seat to see what God has done

754
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,000
 week after week.

755
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,040
 It's been amazing.

756
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,440
 And what he's done all over the country and the privilege of getting invited into

757
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,200
 dorm rooms and apartments where people are listening or on different walks and gyms

758
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,680
 where people are exercising and just the ways God has been writing amazing stories.

759
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,720
 And people come down, they're like, "The porch changed my life.

760
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,120
 The porch never changed any life.

761
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,720
 Jesus changed your life."

762
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:59,920
 And it has been so incredible to see him write these stories.

763
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:10,120
 And I'll never understand why he would give that privilege for me to get to see.

764
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:22,400
 And my wife, who's actually here tonight, and I have for the last 12 months prayed

765
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:33,160
 and wrestled and felt like God is leading us to transition to something different.

766
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,200
 And we don't know what that is and we're not disappearing.

767
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:48,680
 We love this church, but over the last 12 months, it has continued for him to put on

768
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,400
 our heart leading to do something different.

769
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,640
 And the timing doesn't make sense and I cannot say enough amazing things.

770
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,800
 I want to be very, very clear.

771
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,840
 I love this church.

772
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:14,840
 I have received more from Watermark in 13 years than I will ever or could ever repay.

773
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,920
 I love our leadership.

774
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,120
 They have discipled me.

775
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,600
 They've taught me God's word, how to think, so many of the things that even was

776
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,920
 shared here.

777
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,520
 I will spend the rest of my life sharing with other people things that I was just

778
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,600
 poured into and shared by the leadership and the elders here.

779
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,880
 We love this place and have loved serving and seeing God at work.

780
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,240
 And we cannot deny, we also feel like God's stirring and leading.

781
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,720
 And that is scary because we don't know what's next and we don't know what that is.

782
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,080
 We just felt like he was saying, "I need you to trust me.

783
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,320
 I want you to trust me," or inviting us to trust him.

784
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,240
 I love this team.

785
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,160
 My team is the best team at Watermark.

786
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,600
 I'm biased, but I think we have the best team, the Ports team.

787
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,720
 It's incredible.

788
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,600
 And God is, I believe, going to continue to write amazing stories.

789
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,240
 The best, brightest days of the ministry are in front and I want to do anything and

790
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,400
 everything and come back at any point in any time to help and to serve and to

791
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,880
 support in any way that I can.

792
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,480
 But we feel like this is the step that God's leading us to and where we're trying

793
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,840
 to live out and trust God's word and trust God's will and trust God's way.

794
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:42,760
 And so, we'd invite you to pray for that and know that we love this place.

795
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,440
 This was one of the harder decisions that I've ever had to make and yet we felt like

796
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,440
 it was God's leading.

797
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,680
 And we love you.

798
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,720
 I love and I'm so honored and humbled to have gotten to play a small role in the

799
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,640
 ways that God's at work in so many of your stories.

800
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,880
 And thank you.

801
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,000
 I'd love to invite our elders, a couple of our elders and some of my team just up

802
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,880
 here along with my wife just for prayer.

803
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,880
 And these are the men that I mentioned who I love deeply, who have impacted my life

804
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:28,400
 greatly and have for years been one of God's greatest amazing gifts.

805
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,720
 In fact, I'll say this last thing.

806
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,800
 When I was at DTS, I had to write a dissertation for my, like, final paper

807
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,200
 when I was in seminary.

808
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,400
 And I said, "It was about your church, like, what's your favorite thing?"

809
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,040
 And I wrote our elders.

810
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:55,000
 And we just love this place, man.

811
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 - Love you, too.

812
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:06,480
 - Can I jump in?

813
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,480
 - Yeah, please.

814
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
 - All right.

815
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,000
 Hey, my name's Kyle Thompson.

816
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,560
 And I've had the joy of serving as an elder here at Watermark for over 18 years.

817
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:26,040
 And 13 years ago, I was hanging out and met a young guy who was in seminary.

818
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,120
 Just come on staff.

819
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:34,640
 And you know, those times when you meet someone, and even though I'm 30 years older than David,

820
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,960
 there was a real connection.

821
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,800
 And we developed a friendship.

822
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,660
 And that friendship has only grown over the last decade.

823
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:51,400
 My wife and I, when David and Callie got married over 10 years ago, we got to lead their newly

824
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,200
 married community group.

825
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,720
 So we got to spend a lot of time together in those early years.

826
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,920
 And David and I have continued to spend time together over the years.

827
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,840
 And a couple of things that I want to say.

828
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:12,520
 You know, David is one of the most gifted teachers that we've had on staff here at Watermark.

829
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:19,560
 And one of the things that we want to do first, I just want to publicly thank David for his

830
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:27,840
 investment here, for his ministry here, and just the ways that he has allowed God to use

831
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,680
 him to impact really thousands of lives.

832
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,000
 And I'm one of them.

833
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,900
 But I just want to publicly have us thank him for the ways that he's surrendered and

834
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,360
 allowed God to use him here.

835
00:48:40,360 --> 00:49:02,120
 So thank you.

836
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,920
 And you know, y'all can be seated.

837
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:14,440
 The second thing, and this is so easy to miss, but I want to affirm what you heard David

838
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,800
 say.

839
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:23,400
 You know, one of the hardest things to do is when we're in a place where we feel like

840
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,680
 we're thriving and God's using us and we're comfortable and we kind of, you know, you're

841
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:39,800
 in the pattern, you know the routine, is to surrender and to have silence and solitude

842
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,320
 and to hear the voice of the Spirit when He's prodding us to move.

843
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:51,720
 And as you heard David say, that typically doesn't happen, you know, in a dream or in

844
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,840
 an instant.

845
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,120
 That's something that happens over days and weeks and months.

846
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:04,040
 And you heard him say that he and Callie have wrestled with this for close to a year.

847
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,960
 I've had the privilege of getting to be a part of that process and time that David and

848
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:17,160
 I have spent together talking and praying and just being a sounding board, just, you

849
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:23,760
 know, in affirming that hey, this may be what God's doing as much as we love having you

850
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,920
 here.

851
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:31,120
 And so I just, you know, to step out on faith like that, especially when you don't know

852
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,720
 what's next, that's a scary thing.

853
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
 But that's our Bible.

854
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,960
 I mean, you see that.

855
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,360
 You saw it in Abraham.

856
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,200
 You see it all through Scripture.

857
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:47,840
 And so as David said, man, you guys just continue to pray for them and it's going to be great.

858
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:53,920
 I love that we're going to continue to have shared ministry together with wherever David

859
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,240
 and Callie end up.

860
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,080
 We've got platforms here that we host.

861
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:06,680
 And so I'm excited how, you know, just the ways that we as Watermark are going to continue

862
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,560
 to partner in shared ministry with, and we don't know exactly what that looks like, but

863
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:18,120
 what we want to do, the most important thing we can do and we want to continue to do is

864
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:23,040
 I want to invite Callie up here because this is a journey for David and Callie.

865
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,520
 This is not David.

866
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:30,320
 And then Blake Holmes, who's our lead pastor and my fellow elder, we lead together here.

867
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,520
 I want Blake to come up.

868
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,000
 And then Josiah, I'd love for you and Sam to come up also.

869
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,080
 And we're going to, we're going to, I'm going to lead us in, in, in just praying for them,

870
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,240
 you know, doing what we said.

871
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:52,800
 We can talk all day, but God does things supernaturally just as we humble ourselves before Him.

872
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,440
 And so Father, I do thank you for David and Callie.

873
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,080
 I thank you for, again, that just the ways that you've used them to love people, to disciple

874
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,080
 people, to teach.

875
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:15,920
 Just thank you for the ways that they honor you by honoring your word, by following you,

876
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,380
 by imitating what Christ would have them do so that they are worthy of imitation.

877
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,920
 And Father, I do pray that you would overwhelm them with your grace and your love and your

878
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:37,960
 peace, the peace that you give, not as the world gives, and in a way that they can just

879
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:46,060
 rest and not operate under a timetable other than what your timetable is.

880
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:51,900
 You tell us in your word that you make our path clear, that in your presence is fullness

881
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:56,000
 of joy, in your right hand are pleasures forever.

882
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,880
 And I thank you that that's a promise.

883
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:06,720
 And so just as you guide and direct them, that you would just, again, allow them to

884
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,080
 rest in that peace.

885
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:16,640
 Father, I do pray that you direct conversations that you'd even, you know, use tonight as

886
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,880
 part of that process.

887
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:24,560
 We know that there's so many things that you're doing that we don't see, and yet sometimes

888
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,380
 we get to see the levers that you're pulling and get a glimpse of what that is.

889
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:36,420
 And so just thank you for the journey that they're on, which is rooted and traced in

890
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:41,340
 trust and faith in you, which is what this life is all about.

891
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,380
 And so I just pray that you would make that clear.

892
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:51,180
 We look forward to, again, how we're going to get to be on stages together and just continuing

893
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:57,740
 to follow you as we lock arms in ministry, as we love your people.

894
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:04,100
 And so just thank you for the sweetness of relationship, the way you created us for relationship

895
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:09,280
 with each other, the way we get to experience just the intimacy of that.

896
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,940
 And above all, the way we get to experience the intimacy of relationship with you through

897
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,940
 Jesus.

898
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
 Amen.

899
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,740
 Blake, I'm going to let you wrap it.

900
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:26,900
 >> All right, well, again, my name is Blake Holmes, and I just want to publicly thank

901
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,500
 David as well for serving here faithfully for 13 years.

902
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:36,020
 I've been on staff for 20 years, so David and I have had many years serving together.

903
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,360
 We've encouraged each other, we've sought the Lord in prayer together, we've admonished

904
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,360
 one another, and we've certainly laughed with each other.

905
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,440
 And we've laughed.

906
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,000
 And I got just one story I've got to tell on David.

907
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,920
 I won't tell the milk story, David.

908
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,400
 I won't share that.

909
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,640
 Who believed he could drink a gallon of milk in less than an hour.

910
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,560
 And I do remember that staff retreat.

911
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
 Was that your first staff retreat?

912
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
 >> I think so.

913
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,560
 >> Yeah.

914
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,040
 And then the other staff retreat, do you remember the raft that you tried to build to get us

915
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,240
 from one side of the pool to the other?

916
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:19,000
 Yeah, he went to A&M, and his raft was about that deep.

917
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,640
 And it certainly took on water.

918
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,320
 It sunk the first few seconds it got in there.

919
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,960
 I say a lot to go, hey, listen, you know David is a teacher and a communicator.

920
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,160
 And I know him as a friend, as a brother in Christ.

921
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,520
 And it really has been an honor and a joy just to walk with him.

922
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,420
 And I know that this year I've been a part of that process as well, that he's felt that

923
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,720
 stirring of, hey, what's next for me?

924
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:53,800
 And so I know every time there's a transition like this, right, there's -- it raises questions.

925
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:59,000
 And for you, there's candidly, selfishly, there's a part that you're probably sitting

926
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,680
 there going, okay, what does this mean for the porch, right?

927
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,420
 And you could be sad or you could be mad or you could be confused by all that.

928
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,420
 And I get that.

929
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,800
 I totally get that.

930
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,600
 Having served here for 20 years, I've had really good friends I've served beside -- he

931
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,120
 mentioned JP, served beside JP for years.

932
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,320
 I was sad when JP transitioned.

933
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,120
 And I can give many other names.

934
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,520
 But I certainly haven't lost touch with those guys.

935
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,520
 I love them.

936
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,920
 In fact, on Friday, I'm spending much of my day with JP on Friday.

937
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,360
 And I intend to spend time and laugh and continue to share stories with D. Marvin in the future

938
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,360
 as well.

939
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:44,440
 But as far as just to encourage you, I want to invite you to do more than just attend

940
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,320
 the porch on Tuesday nights.

941
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:52,960
 I want to invite you to be a part of the body of Christ at Watermark, to join us, to be

942
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,280
 a part of the family that David spoke of.

943
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,640
 It's God's provision for you.

944
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,880
 He doesn't intend for you to live your life with him as just a Jesus and me mindset.

945
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,760
 But calls you into a family of God where you are loved, cared for, supported, and fully

946
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,560
 known.

947
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,840
 And so that's the first thing.

948
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:17,560
 And then as far as the porch on Tuesday nights in the spring, you guys have heard Timothy

949
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,400
 Atik, TA, some of you from A&M and Breakaway.

950
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,600
 He's going to kick off a series for us in the spring.

951
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,240
 I know you're going to be blessed by.

952
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:32,520
 So January 24th, put that on your calendar and I hope to see you then.

953
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
 Okay.

954
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:41,280
 Hey, one song that the church has historically sung for generations is the doxology.

955
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,080
 And I know staff come and go.

956
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,400
 There's going to be a time where I'm going to leave, but there's three things that never

957
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
 change.

958
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
 Right?

959
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,520
 And that's the word of God, the character of God, and the mission of God.

960
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,520
 Those things never change.

961
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,480
 And so we're going to stand and we're going to sing what the church has sung for generations,

962
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,680
 reminding ourselves of the character of God and his goodness.

963
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,680
 So let's stay in.

964
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,680
 Let's do that.
