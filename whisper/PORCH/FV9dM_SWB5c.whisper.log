[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.620]   - Well, welcome to the porch.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.680]   My name is Josiah and I'm so glad
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.300]   that you decided to tune in with us tonight
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.420]   wherever you're watching from across the country
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.400]   and even the world.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.740]   Welcome and thank you friends in this room for being here.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.000]   Appreciate that very much.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.960]   Well, hey, we've been in a series called a fact check
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.320]   over the last couple of weeks
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.160]   where we are facing really the truth about our faith
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.920]   and putting the claims of faith,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180]   putting the claims that we hold true as Christians
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.800]   for thousands of years to the test.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.880]   We're putting these truths on trial, so to speak.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.860]   And so week one, we talked about this claim
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.840]   that God is still good and bad things happen.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.800]   Last week, we talked about this claim
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.160]   that the Bible is the actual words of God.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.520]   And tonight we pull up to this claim
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.960]   that many of you are probably familiar with,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.520]   and that's the claim,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.280]   Christianity is the only true religion.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.600]   And even when I think about that claim,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.420]   I can't help but think, man, how do we know that?
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.680]   Like, how do we know that Christianity
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.640]   is the only true religion?
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.840]   Isn't it just like people's opinions?
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   I mean, for so long,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.440]   people just throw out different opinions here and there,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.720]   and we love opinions, don't we?
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.960]   We live in a world where opinions are given freely.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.800]   I mean, I love giving my own opinion.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.360]   How many of you are watching "The Last Dance"?
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.680]   It's basically a documentary of the Chicago Bulls
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.080]   and Michael Jordan.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.700]   It happens every Sunday night at 8 p.m.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.540]   Man, I love it.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.980]   I've been tuned in the last two weeks.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.920]   And basically, they're just retracing
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.680]   what took place that final season
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.220]   where they had the dynasty together.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.560]   Man, you should check it out for real,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.020]   8 p.m. on Sunday night.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.280]   And so I got to thinking
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.940]   as I was watching the last two weeks, I couldn't help,
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.180]   and I'm gonna go on record tonight
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.460]   to say that Michael Jordan
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.700]   is the greatest basketball player of all time.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.120]   Facts, truth, like that, there's just no debate, man.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.280]   You're wrong if you say anything different, period.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.780]   But here's the deal.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.140]   There's another debate going on in our culture right now.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.540]   And this one is more serious
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.980]   than the greatest basketball player of all time,
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.340]   the GOAT, Jordan.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.820]   And it's really not so clear.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.860]   It has to do with the coronavirus,
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.500]   the pandemic that's plagued our nation and the world.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.180]   And people are debating when should we get back to normal?
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.220]   How should we reopen the country?
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.000]   When should people go back to work?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.460]   And man, if you've just turned on the news for five minutes,
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.140]   you'll see that, man, there's people debating all over
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.140]   when it comes to how we should restore our country.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.700]   And it's pretty clear that everyone disagrees
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.980]   with what should be done.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.580]   But it's just not clear on what is the right way.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.740]   And everyone has their own opinions.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.220]   And so I start there tonight
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.580]   because when I think about Christianity
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.580]   being the only religion,
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.400]   when I think about this word religion as a whole,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.820]   it reminds me of where I found myself 15 years ago
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.840]   in my college apartment,
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.220]   where I just thought, hey, it's just really a matter
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.620]   of people's personal opinion.
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.340]   And we can't really know what religion is true.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.540]   And for Christians to claim Christianity is the only way,
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.940]   man, that just seems narrow-minded.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.140]   That seems exclusive.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.700]   That just seems wrong.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.660]   And then I began asking questions like,
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.420]   man, how can we be certain that Christianity
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.420]   is the right faith, the right religion?
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.780]   Is it because we grew up here in America?
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.140]   I mean, what about the kid that grew up Islam
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.120]   in that family?
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.420]   I mean, he really didn't have a shot, did he?
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.780]   And then I would ask questions like,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.220]   things like, isn't it arrogant and unloving
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.200]   for God not to be welcoming to all?
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.020]   I mean, these were questions that I was asking critically
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.400]   and trying to get answers.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.960]   And maybe tonight you're here or you're watching online
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   and you're asking questions similar to what I asked
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.180]   when I found myself in my college apartment wondering,
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.060]   man, is there anything outside of what I see
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.020]   underneath the sun?
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.340]   And so most people, I would say, in our generation,
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.980]   we're known as the millennials, would say,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.760]   hey, you know, really all religions are pretty much
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.780]   the same and we have facts to back it up.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.040]   There's stats, I should say, on this thinking and belief.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   And here's where we get some of this data right here.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.300]   It says, although 65% classify themselves as Christians,
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.300]   43% said that it doesn't matter what religious faith
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.820]   you follow because they all teach the same lessons.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.740]   65% of people who claim to be Christians
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.740]   and 43% say that it really doesn't matter, just pick one.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.460]   70% of all major, 70% of Christians
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.940]   and non-Christian religious groups say many religions
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.300]   lead to eternal life, that was USA Today.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.900]   48% believe if a person is generally good
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.260]   or does enough good things for others,
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.940]   they will earn a place in heaven.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.780]   50% believe that all people are eventually saved
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.020]   or accepted by God no matter what they do.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.160]   But when you start saying, hey, Jesus is the only way,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.040]   hey, there's only one way to get to God,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.540]   that's when people are like, whoa, bro, like calm down,
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.300]   chill, that just does not, that seems way narrow-minded.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.740]   Like that doesn't even seem like it's accurate, man.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.960]   We live in 2020, what are you talking about?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.500]   You just need to calm down.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.420]   And so tonight, can we fact check that?
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.980]   We're going to fact check,
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.820]   is Christianity the only true religion?
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.180]   So tonight I want you to see that Christianity is exclusive.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.740]   And before we finish, I want you to see
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.260]   that Christianity is also very inclusive.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.680]   We're going to be in Acts chapter four,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.900]   and the Bible is made up of the Old Testament
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.640]   and the New Testament, so if you go to Matthew,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.780]   which is the first book of the New Testament,
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.260]   just go Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and you'll find Acts,
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.420]   and we're going to be in Acts chapter four.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.560]   And this is where Jesus died, he rose again,
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.100]   and his followers are now bold men
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.260]   because what they have seen Jesus do,
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.580]   and there's a man named Peter, one of his disciples,
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.180]   who stands up boldly, and he's on trial for his faith
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.060]   because he's preaching there is no other way.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.780]   And this is what he says in verse 11.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.220]   "Jesus is the stone you builders rejected."
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.540]   So he's getting very personal,
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.380]   which has become the cornerstone,
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.380]   or some translation says the chief cornerstone.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.460]   In other words, hey, Jesus is the person
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.300]   that I'm staking my entire faith on.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.740]   And then he goes on and says,
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.980]   makes a very exclusive statement in verse 12.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.460]   He says, "Salvation is found in no one else,
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.680]   "for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind,
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.060]   "which we must be saved."
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.540]   Point number one, if you're taking notes,
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.360]   and I hope you are, Christianity is exclusive.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.700]   Christianity is exclusive, like it makes exclusive claims
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.420]   like we see Peter making here.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.100]   "For there is no other way by which man
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.660]   "can be made right with God."
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.180]   Really?
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.220]   Like, is that true?
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.840]   And our culture today is much like the culture
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.680]   Peter was living in.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.700]   For you say that there is only one way to God,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.540]   and people would say, no, man,
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.300]   that's just too rigid of thinking.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.460]   Like, you need to get outside the box.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.540]   Let's get all along.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.380]   Let's just get along.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.420]   Can we just not coexist?
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.740]   You know, that bumper sticker?
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.420]   And I guess you have to ask yourself,
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.860]   what do you mean when you say coexist?
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.660]   Do I mean, hey, we should accept people,
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.540]   we should love people?
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.340]   Absolutely.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.260]   But if we think that, hey, man,
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.900]   we should just think that all religions
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.340]   lead to the same place,
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.880]   that's where we would draw the line as Christians.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.780]   See, the Roman Empire was a pantheon of gods,
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.980]   very pluralistic, much like our day.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.900]   They were okay with you having your gods
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.480]   and you having your gods over here,
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.760]   but as soon as you said, hey, there's only one God,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.720]   that's when they raised hell.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.660]   And so you want to divide a room?
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.920]   Just give God a name.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.500]   Say Jesus is God.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.520]   This is why we can't pray in schools anymore
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.180]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.940]   If we pray, it's got to be an all type of faith
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.620]   type of prayer.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.740]   And we just need to generalize God is God.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.260]   Listen, I don't believe that
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.700]   we're becoming a godless nation.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.420]   Like, I believe we're becoming a nation of many gods.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.900]   Like, I don't believe we're becoming
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.660]   a godless nation in America.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.660]   I just believe we're becoming a nation of many gods.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.580]   And here's what I mean by that.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.140]   The temperature and climate in America
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.460]   is much like the climate of Rome
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.160]   where Peter was put on trial.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.440]   So you have this pluralistic culture,
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.620]   a culture of many gods,
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.860]   and when Peter stands up and says,
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.700]   hey, there is no other name under heaven
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.860]   by which men may be right with God,
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.500]   and that name is Jesus.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.620]   That's when people start having problems
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.180]   and saying, Peter, you have your thing,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.060]   we have our thing, let us just get along.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.220]   Like, why do you have to specifically
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.860]   call out who that God is?
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.020]   And so, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.660]   here in America, yeah, your God,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.780]   you might not claim Jesus,
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.500]   you might not claim Buddha,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.780]   you might not claim Islam,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.900]   but listen, your God might be sports.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.340]   Your God might be money.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.960]   Your God might be food.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.880]   Like, it just looks different.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.040]   Or your God might just be
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.560]   more of the secular humanism route
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.420]   where you just become your own God.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.240]   I don't believe that we're becoming a godless nation.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.360]   I believe we're becoming a nation of many gods.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.280]   And listen, you've probably heard this argument before,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.800]   but you have never heard that all roads
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.320]   lead to the same conclusion
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.540]   from someone who's really studied
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.840]   the different faith systems.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.760]   And I would contend that not every religion
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.520]   and I would contend that every religion
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.080]   and every major belief system at its core is exclusivity.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.980]   Let me explain.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.560]   We'll start with Islam.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.160]   This comes from the Quran, the holy writings of Islam.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.240]   Directly from the Quran, it says this,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.200]   "And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.640]   "it will never be accepted of him.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   "And in the hereafter, he will be one of the losers."
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.280]   He'll be one of the losers.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.840]   Like that just seems pretty exclusive.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.300]   It also says in the Quran that,
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.000]   "They have certainly disbelieved
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.060]   "who say that Allah is Christ, the son of Mary.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.700]   "Allah has forbidden him in paradise and his refuge is fire."
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.820]   This feels pretty exclusive to me.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.600]   I mean, it goes on and says,
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.360]   "Hey, basically, hey, if you're a Christian,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.200]   "you're following Jesus,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.760]   "then your eternal destiny is hell."
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.720]   Says it pretty plainly.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.920]   Let's go to Hinduism,
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   which many believers or people that think about Hinduism,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.520]   the belief of Hinduism,
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.520]   and even people that have looked into Hinduism,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.320]   says it's a very inclusive religion.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.280]   This comes directly from the Bhagavad Gita,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.540]   Bhagavad Gita, the holy writings of Hinduism.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.880]   This is Krishna, one of the Hindu gods speaking,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.660]   and this is what he says.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.760]   "Those who are without faith in my teaching
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.920]   "cannot attain Krishna," or in other words, enlightenment.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.180]   "I permeate all the universe in my unmanifest form.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.360]   "All beings exist within me."
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.200]   So he basically is saying,
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.800]   hey, if you don't accept this view, then you don't exist.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   And we know that Hinduism, they have a different outcome,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.280]   a different heaven.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.240]   They don't even believe in heaven.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.560]   They believe in reincarnation.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.260]   They believe that you'll come back to life
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.740]   as an animal or another person.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.320]   Then there's Buddhism.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.800]   Buddhism says this from the holy writings of Buddhism
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.600]   in the passage, oddly enough, entitled "The Way,"
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.520]   which quite frankly,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.440]   that's what Christians called themselves.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.280]   Early on, they called themselves "The Way."
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.200]   It says this, "Buddhism is the only path,"
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.080]   feels pretty exclusive.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.860]   "There is none other for the purification of insight.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.140]   "Walking upon this path, you will make an end of suffering."
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.720]   That just feels pretty exclusive.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.560]   Then you go to Judaism, the Jewish faith,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.440]   and it expresses itself in the concept of chosen people.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.160]   Like the Jews believe that they are exclusively
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.260]   God's chosen people.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:31.260]   You see this idea of exclusivity again.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.020]   And so all these faith claims have exclusivity written
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.360]   at the core of who they are.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   And so when we pull up to the Christian faith,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.440]   like it shouldn't surprise you at all
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.040]   that at the core of the Christian faith is exclusivity.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.440]   Turn with me to John 14, verse six.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.560]   Jesus makes an audacious claim.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.160]   And this is what he says in John 14, six.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   "Jesus answered, 'I am the way, I am the truth,
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.940]   "'and I am the life.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.040]   "'No one comes to the Father except through me.'"
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.880]   In other words, he's saying,
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.960]   there's no way else to interpret this.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.280]   Like he's saying, hey, he's the way,
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.000]   he's the truth, and he's the life.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.200]   Very exclusive.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   No one gets to God except through Jesus.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.920]   Jesus is not saying he's a way.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.520]   He is saying he is the way.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.160]   And what's crazy here is all religions
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.480]   contradict each other.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.040]   So to say they're all right is to say they're all wrong.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.160]   Like, let me say that again.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.240]   All religions contradict each other.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.440]   If they're saying they're all right
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.900]   is to say they're all wrong.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.880]   And so this is where we have to, man, use our brain.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.200]   Like, man, when you follow Jesus
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   and you examine the evidence,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.480]   like it's not like some lobotomy
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.800]   where you just check your brain at the door.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.200]   And it's not brain surge.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.600]   Like you actively think about what is at stake here
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.480]   and the evidence that we have.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.920]   And so if someone says all religions are right,
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.680]   they speak from a position of ignorance.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.640]   Like, I don't mean to be insulting or rude in any way.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.460]   It's just a fact.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.840]   All religions contradict themselves
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.400]   on the basis of exclusivity.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.800]   And so what we've done in our culture
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.600]   is we've just watered down everything
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.400]   and we've gotten drunk on tolerance.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.960]   I mean, we just watered down everything
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.280]   and just gotten drunk on tolerance.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.560]   Let's just accept every way.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.520]   Let me explain it like this.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.000]   I was quarantined for, and many of you too,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.120]   I mean, just the expectations of the CDC
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   and what's coming out.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.160]   And there was a moment where I thought I actually had it,
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.920]   but I didn't, but I was quarantined.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.880]   And many of you, man, you've been laid up in your house
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.120]   and hanging out and having a lot of time.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.240]   And so what I know about this season
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.160]   is that when I get outside of this season,
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.420]   like I wanna get out.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.160]   Like I wanna go explore something.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.680]   Like I haven't even been able to vacation
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.760]   or go hang out anywhere.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.520]   And so imagine with me,
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.760]   imagine with me that the CDC comes out and they said,
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.280]   hey, everything's good to go.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.400]   And things begin to open back up and the coronavirus,
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.260]   man, there's no trace of that anymore.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.060]   Like our nation is healed pretty much, right?
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.680]   And I'll just be honest, like,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.040]   hey, one of the first things I'm gonna do,
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.400]   it's like, I'm gonna buy a plane ticket.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.280]   And so imagine you bought a plane ticket
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.160]   and you're like, hey, I'm gonna go out to,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.200]   I'm gonna go to Destin, Florida.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.440]   It seems like a pretty good time of year to go to the beach,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.280]   white sands, clear water,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.940]   man, we're gonna go to Destin, it's gonna be amazing.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.920]   And so you get your ticket and you show up to the airport
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.600]   and you begin to look for your ticket
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.840]   and you can't find your ticket anywhere.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.400]   And you don't know where to board,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   you don't know what plane to get on.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.040]   And I come up to you, I see that you're distressed, right?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.000]   I see that, man, you're freaking out.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.800]   And I just come up to you and I just say,
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.520]   hey, don't worry about it, I see that you're stressed.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.440]   Hey, don't worry about it,
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.880]   just jump on any one of these planes,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.400]   go to any terminals and whatever plane you get on,
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.600]   it's gonna take you to Destin, Florida.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.480]   Like you're gonna get there, it's gonna be fine.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.120]   And in that moment, like, man, you're thankful,
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.920]   you appreciate that I've given you a solution.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.800]   And, but what happens is you get on the plane
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.400]   and you're not that appreciative because you end up in,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.320]   let's just say you end up in China, right?
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.440]   And at the end of the day, you end up there
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.400]   and when you get there, you're gonna realize
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.560]   that one of the most unloving things that I could have done
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.840]   is just told you, hey, there's just,
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.960]   anyway, just pick a plane, get on.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.320]   That would be very unloving.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.560]   And you would find out that I'm a liar.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   And so my whole point in this illustration
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.400]   is I'm making here is that all religions can't be true.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.480]   And it's unloving to say they're all true,
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.720]   but it's unloving to say they all lead to the same place
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.520]   because religions are exclusive.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.680]   Christianity is exclusive, Jesus is exclusive.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.400]   So here's the dilemma that we find ourselves in.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.960]   If every religion claims to be right,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.720]   how do we know which religion is right?
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.560]   Great question.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.800]   I wanna take the next few minutes that I have
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.120]   to unpack this and to share with you why I believe
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.920]   and why we believe as Christians
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.400]   that it is really the one true religion.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.920]   Point number two, if you're taking notes,
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.960]   Christianity is the most inclusive.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.320]   Christianity is the most inclusive of them all.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.680]   Wait, bro, you just told me that Christianity is exclusive.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.440]   So how can you now tell me it's inclusive?
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.560]   Here's what I mean by this.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.080]   There is one way, that way is Jesus.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.720]   But that one way is for everyone.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   It includes everyone, no matter your past,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.520]   no matter your family, no matter your upbringing,
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   no matter your socioeconomic status, right?
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.320]   Like it's for everybody, no matter your current religion,
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.880]   no matter if you're rich or poor,
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.400]   whether you're red, yellow, black, or white,
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.080]   it is for everyone.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.720]   Like we find at the core of Christianity,
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.080]   this verse that is familiar with most of the world.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.800]   I mean, we see signs of them holding this verse up
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.640]   in the end zone of football games.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.600]   And the verse is John 3, 16.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.880]   For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.400]   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.560]   but have everlasting life.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.880]   Not whoever behaves, whoever believes,
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.480]   not whoever looks a certain way,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.600]   not whoever does enough deeds,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.760]   but who believes seems inclusive to me.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.080]   Christianity created the most inclusive community.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.280]   Greeks and Romans didn't mix rich and poor, but Jesus did.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:04.040]   Jews didn't mix races or nationalities, but Jesus did.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.600]   Paul would pick up on this in Galatians 3, 28,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.800]   where he says, "There is neither Jew nor Gentile,
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.080]   "nor either slave nor free, nor there's male nor female."
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.200]   You know how women got their rights?
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.600]   It was through Christianity.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.120]   He says this, Jesus says this through Paul,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.840]   "For you are all one in Christ Jesus."
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.080]   What Paul is saying is the ground
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.840]   at the foot of the cross is level.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.880]   In other words, we all come into this place
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.960]   imperfect people with real problems,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.560]   and Jesus extends to every single one of us the grace.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.480]   In all, everybody who walks planet earth,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.960]   there's an invitation and an opportunity to life
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.040]   and life abundantly because of what Jesus
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.400]   has done on the cross.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.080]   Paul would say in Romans 10, 13, "For everyone,"
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.920]   that seems really inclusive,
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.720]   "For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.640]   "will be saved."
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.060]   It's the only religion on the planet
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.400]   that wherever you are right now in this moment,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.640]   you can sit and cry out to God
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.540]   based on what he's done for you.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.440]   And he will grant you forgiveness
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.160]   and eternal life forever and ever.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.360]   It's not based on what you do,
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   but it's based on what he's done.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   See, I challenge you tonight,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.200]   like when we finish up,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.520]   like just jump on Google and just Google this.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.600]   "How do I convert to Hinduism?
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.060]   "How do I convert to Buddhism?
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.680]   "How do I convert to Islam?"
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Here's what you're gonna find.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.960]   At the core of all these religions,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.120]   you're gonna find you have to do these things.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.320]   At the center of these religions,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.680]   you're gonna have to strive to walk this path,
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.560]   to hold up these pillars,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.720]   to pray for forgiveness in this direction
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.360]   for this many times a day.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.120]   You're gonna need to take a pilgrimage to a place.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.480]   You're gonna need to do these things.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.460]   And then maybe you can get to heaven.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.280]   So you see, it's all about striving.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.120]   Why?
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.220]   Because religion breeds insecurity
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.680]   because you never know if you've done enough.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.660]   But a relationship breeds security.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.520]   And a relationship that's marked by unconditional love
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.440]   and what you find is that when you die,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.720]   if you're pursuing one of these other religions,
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.440]   you stand before whatever the God is
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.040]   and he will determine whether you've done enough.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   And that just seems exhausting, friends.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.060]   That seems crazy to me.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.260]   In Matthew 11, 28, Jesus says to me,
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.840]   "Come to me all who are weary and burdened
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.400]   "and I will put you to work."
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.720]   No, he says, "And I will give you rest."
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.200]   And I'll give you rest.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.400]   Think of it like this.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.280]   I have two little girls, I call them my muchachicas.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.120]   I love them.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.960]   I have a four-year-old,
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.720]   almost a four-year-old and a two-year-old,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.040]   Camille and Isabella.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.360]   There they are.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.520]   Camille's almost four and Isabella's about to turn two.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.840]   And so imagine,
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.480]   imagine my four-year-old Camille
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   who loves to sing and dance comes up to me and says,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.140]   "Daddy, daddy, do you like how I sing and dance?
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.000]   "Is it enough to be a Jones?"
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.960]   And I'm like, "What?
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.840]   "Like, what do you mean?"
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.360]   And then she comes up to me again and she said,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.560]   "Daddy, daddy, do you love my painting?
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.120]   "Is it enough to be a Jones?"
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.520]   That's her last name.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.420]   And I'm like, "Baby, baby, what are you talking about?
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.180]   "Of course, of course it is.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.400]   "You're my daughter.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.300]   "I was there when you came into the world.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.200]   "I know more about you than you know about yourself.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.100]   "Baby, you don't have to do anything to earn my approval.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.980]   "I love you based on who you are in our relationship.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.520]   "You're my daughter,
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.280]   "not because of what you can do for me."
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.160]   And some of you, man,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.900]   you have a really skewed view of the God of the cosmos,
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.380]   of who Jesus is.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.660]   Because you grew up with a father
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.760]   who only affirmed you when your performance
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.180]   was at an all-time high,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.060]   who only loved you when you could perform
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.020]   and get all the As,
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.920]   or you performed well on the sports field or the court.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.340]   And some of you have a really skewed view of God
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.540]   because you don't see God as a loving father.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.820]   You see God as someone that wants to strike you down
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.200]   with lightning every time you fail.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:29.540]   And so religion breeds insecurity of asking the question,
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.380]   "Have I done enough?
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.140]   "Have I done enough?
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.240]   "Am I good enough now?
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.460]   "Am I good enough now?
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.400]   "And my relationship with my daughter
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.280]   "is built on unconditional love.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.660]   "Like she doesn't have to do anything
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.760]   "for me to love her.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.940]   "And when she gets it wrong,
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.420]   "daddy steps in."
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.580]   And yeah, I rebuke, I discipline.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.320]   But I say, "Baby, I do that because I love you,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.520]   "not because I'm out to get you.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.260]   "And my love isn't gonna run out
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.760]   "because of who you are,
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.680]   "not because of what you do or don't do."
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.520]   And in the same way,
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.160]   this is a picture of our relationship with God.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.960]   And God loves you.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.060]   All of us are invited into this relationship.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.000]   You see, Christianity is a story of a God
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.740]   who wants a relationship with you and I,
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.960]   that we rebelled against the creator
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.640]   and we pursued created things above the creator himself.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.660]   And he came down over 2000 years ago
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.220]   in the form of a babe, Christmas.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.120]   And he grew in wisdom and stature.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.720]   And he lived the life that you and I could never live.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.860]   He was perfect in thought, word and action.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.660]   Categories that I fall into every day.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.420]   And because of that,
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.400]   it made him the only eligible one to die on the cross
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.680]   for your sin and my sin.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.860]   And on the cross, all of our sin was poured out on him.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.020]   And he soaked up every last ounce of God's wrath,
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.340]   the wrath that should have been poured out on you and me.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.820]   Why? Because of our sin.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.180]   For the wages of sin is death.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.300]   See, he died the death that we deserve.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.820]   And we get the life that he deserved.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.980]   It's called the great exchange.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.000]   It's a beautiful picture of redemption.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.660]   Christianity is the only religion
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.380]   where we find a God who suffers.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.460]   Every other religion says,
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.300]   "Hey, you have to suffer to get to God by doing X, Y, or Z."
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.340]   You see, religion breeds insecurity
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.740]   because you never know if you've done enough.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.000]   But an unconditional loving relationship breeds security.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.220]   And so this is where I would differ
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.180]   with those people who say Christianity is a religion.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.660]   I would say, "No, it's not."
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.880]   At the heart of Christianity,
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.220]   you will find a God who is crazy about you,
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.820]   who loves you and wants to have a relationship with you.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.820]   The God of the cosmos wants to have a relationship.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.300]   I just think that's crazy.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.060]   Like when I try to wrap my mind around that,
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.260]   it just seems wild that I don't have to do anything
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.660]   for this relationship that's already done.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.240]   On the cross, he said, "It is finished."
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.260]   It means you can't do anything else.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.340]   And so how would you want the God of the universe
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.340]   to pay for your sin?
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.180]   I would argue that anything less
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.020]   than Jesus dying on the cross
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.200]   would lessen our ability to see how much Jesus loves us.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.240]   Anything less than Jesus dying on the cross
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.840]   would lessen our ability to see how much he loves us.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.580]   I mean, John 15, 13 says,
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.920]   "Greater love has no one than this
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.240]   "to lay down his life for one's friends."
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.320]   Do you know this God?
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.280]   His name is Jesus.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.000]   In closing, remember how I opened up?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.800]   With what's the way forward for our country?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.720]   I mean, people are coming out and debating and saying,
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.680]   "Hey, this is the way, this is what we need to do
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.000]   "to reopen the country.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.560]   "Hey, we need to keep everything closed.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.080]   "It's not over, it's gonna get worse."
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.580]   And so people are saying,
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.380]   "How do we restore the things that are broken
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.400]   "because of this pandemic?"
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.760]   And the truth of the matter is this.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.480]   We're gonna have to have a cure.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.200]   Or some type of vaccine to restore the havoc
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.280]   that's been caused by the coronavirus.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.760]   And so I say that because in the same way,
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.880]   Jesus is our cure.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.280]   Like Jesus is our cure.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.840]   Spiritually.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.660]   Left to yourself, left to myself.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:55.800]   Man, we're gonna shipwreck our life if you haven't already.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.360]   You have to bankrupt your life.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.680]   The Bible says in Proverbs 14, 12,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.680]   that there's a way that seems right to man,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.080]   but that way ends in death.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.560]   And I've experienced that.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.800]   That same year, 15 years ago in my college apartment,
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.600]   I was playing college baseball,
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.500]   chasing everything underneath the sun.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.840]   Only to find out I couldn't grab on to anything.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.880]   It just, like I was chasing the wind.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.300]   And for so long, I would compare my life
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.440]   to the rest of the world.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.280]   And when you do that,
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.960]   you can always find someone worse than you,
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.800]   which gives you security in the fact
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.480]   that you're not that bad, right?
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.800]   And so like some of you, frankly, tonight,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.100]   like you just don't see a need for Christ.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.160]   Because you don't see your depravity.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.600]   You don't see your sin for what it is
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.720]   in light of a holy God.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.960]   You've never experienced the God of the universe who came
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.520]   for you and I.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.440]   He died on the cross.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.840]   Scripture says in history of court
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.040]   that he defeated the grave, Easter, right?
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.280]   That's what we celebrate.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.000]   And he says, "The ball's in your court."
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.680]   What are you gonna do with Jesus?
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.320]   When he showed up, he reset the calendar.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.960]   You know, the calendar that's on your phone right now?
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.320]   He reset the calendar.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.700]   The Bible is the best selling book of all time.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.880]   What are you gonna do with Jesus?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:29.080]   The message of Jesus has stood the test of time.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.280]   We're still talking about this God today.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.640]   He's still changing lives.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.040]   Even tonight, some of you are gonna have your life altered
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.680]   for all of eternity because God is moving in your heart.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.720]   It's nothing that I've said.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.680]   It's the God of the universe that's speaking
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.280]   to you right now.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.580]   Do you know this God?
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.900]   Let me pray that you would tonight.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.220]   God in heaven,
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.980]   would you do what no man can do?
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.780]   And would you have your way?
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:12.300]   And God, would you allow people to see who you are?
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:19.180]   Allow them to see the beauty of what you've done?
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.760]   (gentle music)
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.440]   That there is no other name
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.560]   in heaven in which men must be saved.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.860]   The name of Jesus.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.400]   May you do what you've always done.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.500]   May you arrest hearts in this place.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.220]   And those that are watching online,
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.380]   would you have your way?
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.620]   God, we love you.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.040]   And we worship you now in song.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:52.880]   Christ's name.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
