[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.080]   Happy Valentine's Day.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.480]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480]   This is lame, man.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.280]   Happy Valentine's Day.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.200]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.040]   Come on.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.240]   Come on.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.080]   Hey, we love you.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.040]   We love you, Fort Worth and Houston and anybody else
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.520]   driving down the road, spending their Valentine's Day with us
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.560]   here at the porch.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.080]   Man, if you do not like photos of couples,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.000]   I hope you stayed off Instagram today, man.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.720]   It was like an overload.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.560]   I mean, it was--
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.200]   even I was a little grossed out by it.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.280]   I was like, I'm not going to fall into that trap.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.600]   It was everywhere.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.040]   And man, this day, it can serve as a reminder,
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.360]   as an incredible blessing to some for the relationship
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.800]   that we have, and for others, it can just kind of be this heavy,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.520]   I hate it, and it keeps coming back around
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.920]   and reminds me that I'm single and don't even
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.920]   have a prospect, and I hope it never comes again.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.600]   So I don't know where you're at, but I'm glad you're here.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.520]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.600]   And so let me pray for us.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.080]   I know John just did, but we need extra prayer tonight.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.200]   Father, inform our hearts tonight.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.800]   As we dive into a topic that is so relevant to so many of us
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.360]   and has impacted so many of our lives,
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.160]   Lord, would you please speak to us from the scriptures?
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.440]   Would you please undo what culture has done
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.000]   in our hearts and our minds?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.280]   And would you give us a biblical worldview of dating,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.320]   and marriage, and relationships, and what
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.440]   you would have us do?
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.640]   And would you just kind of remove the cynicism,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   the any callous nature of our hearts,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.080]   and opinions, and predispositions?
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.240]   Would you just kind of level the playing field as we dive in?
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.120]   Protect them from my opinion, God.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.760]   And would your Holy Spirit supernaturally
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.720]   move through these words and this ancient story
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.040]   to show us what you value and what you desire from us
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.200]   in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.360]   Amen.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.400]   When my wife and my family, we moved into a house,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.200]   we actually had the opportunity to build a house,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.000]   we moved into a new neighborhood.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.680]   And so that meant new neighbors.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.120]   And my neighbor lady across the street,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.680]   directly across the street from my house,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.400]   she was always in her yard.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.880]   And so she was a divorced empty nester,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.640]   and she had a full-time job,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.600]   but whenever she would get home about five o'clock,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.640]   from five o'clock to sunset,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.440]   she was working in her flower beds.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.520]   And there was no flowers there,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.920]   she was just kind of prepping the beds.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.760]   And I watched as the months rolled by,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.120]   she would bring in this organic soil and reshape the beds.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.240]   And then a few months later,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.760]   I saw these incredible plants begin to grow.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.080]   And then when spring hit,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.960]   there's no exaggeration in the story,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.280]   I mean, it just exploded with roses.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.840]   I'm talking hundreds, maybe thousands of roses,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.400]   so much so that every single person
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.800]   that came to see us would comment,
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.700]   they'd walk in our house,
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.600]   anybody that came to our house for the first time,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.440]   they would say, "Wow, did you see that rose garden
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.280]   "across the street?"
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.200]   I'm like, "How could I miss it?"
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.520]   Yeah, it's like right there every time.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.240]   It was like, when I'd sit at the sink,
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.080]   I'd look through the windows
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   and it was just this explosion of bright red.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.920]   And they grew up to about half the height of her house,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.080]   and it was just beautiful.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.920]   It was breathtaking.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.520]   I'd watch cars drive by and slow down in front of her house
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.800]   because of these roses.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.120]   And she would spend all weekend out there.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.400]   She'd have these pruning shears.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.200]   She was always, she'd wear these knee pads,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.240]   and she was just out there constantly working.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.800]   If she was home, she was outside.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.000]   If she was at home and the sun was up,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.680]   she was outside working on this rose garden.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.280]   And so she was relocated through her work
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.920]   and had to move to Atlanta.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.720]   And so I watched her put her house for sale.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   I watched people begin to view the house
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.560]   and everybody would stop and they'd walk around
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.840]   and just kind of blown away by the rose garden.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.680]   It didn't take the house long to sell.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.120]   In about a week, had a contract on it
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.960]   because again, the rose garden.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.760]   And a newly married couple moved in.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.280]   And so they purchased the home, they moved in,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.180]   and loved the roses obviously.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.200]   But their newly married couple both had jobs, very busy.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.560]   And I watched as the months rolled by,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.200]   the roses began to get neglected, to be neglected.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.480]   And lo and behold, started to wither and die.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.220]   Weeds crept into the beds.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.040]   And that which was beautiful was no longer.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.740]   Because the beauty took work.
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.760]   The beauty took preparation.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.300]   The beauty took forethought.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.720]   The beauty took prioritizing things
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.580]   that some people don't have time to prioritize
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.640]   or desire to prioritize.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.880]   And so that which was beautiful withered and died.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.020]   And in the same way, everyone here,
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.120]   the vast majority of you,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.600]   that's who I'm gonna speak to tonight.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.960]   If you're here and you don't wanna be married,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.260]   we're so glad you're here.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.640]   I hope that you are, as the scripture says,
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.720]   a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom,
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.480]   meaning single for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.520]   But if you're here and you desire to be married,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.480]   I imagine that's the majority of you.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.560]   And you want a beautiful marriage.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.400]   But as I've spent the last decade
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   meeting with single friends,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.720]   I don't think we realize the work
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.600]   that a beautiful marriage takes now.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.520]   Like today, like you can start on this work today.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.160]   And so on this very day, Valentine's Day,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.680]   America, Americans will spend 18.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.000]   What if I told you Americans spent $18 million today
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.500]   telling people they love them?
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.720]   I would be about $18 billion off.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   It's $18 billion spent on this day by Americans.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.480]   $2 billion on roses and flowers alone.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.760]   $2 billion with a B that we spend on this holiday
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.260]   being exploited by Hallmark.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.860]   [congregation laughing]
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.680]   As we've fallen into the traps of our culture,
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.300]   and it's so easy for us to say I love you on a day,
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.040]   it's so difficult for us to show someone
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.080]   that we love them with our lies.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.920]   Because again, we've bought into the lies of culture.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.300]   Culture is what is informing you on how to date.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.380]   It's the people who are terrible at it.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.220]   That's where you're learning.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.380]   That's where you're learning how to date from Brad
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.380]   and Angelina and 50 Shades of Stupid and The Bachelor.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.140]   This cultural phenomenon, 21 seasons strong saying,
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.500]   hey, this is what dating looks like,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.580]   that there would be a man and he'd choose
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.860]   from these 25 girls as he goes on a date with all of them.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.860]   And the 21 seasons strong and the success rate so far is two.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.140]   But that's where you'll learn it from.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.540]   And do you know why it resonates with us so deeply?
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.140]   Because that's how we feel.
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.100]   You either feel like a man trying to figure out
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.300]   who you're going to choose and you wanna choose right
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.220]   and will you accept this rose?
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.220]   Or you feel like a woman, like this commodity among many
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.780]   that you're just waiting to be chosen.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.020]   And it's a wrong perspective.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.660]   The reason that this resonates so deeply with us
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.900]   is because we can laugh at it,
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.740]   we can think it's silly,
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.380]   but in reality, it resonates deeply with us
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.340]   'cause it's what we feel like we are living.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.140]   Manic highs and manic lows of relationships.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.140]   Not the service that a real relationship takes.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.560]   And so maybe you're here and maybe you're one of those
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.360]   that are cynical and you think, well, who needs marriage?
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.580]   If marriage is so much work,
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.980]   well, I don't really need to be married.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.380]   You don't understand what marriage is.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.020]   Like you almost have to read this book
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.620]   like you're on a deserted island
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.700]   and you have to unlearn some things and say,
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.980]   okay, God, what do you want for me in regards to marriage?
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.060]   Do you know that marriage shows up in the scripture
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.500]   in the first chapter of Genesis
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.180]   or really the second chapter of Genesis
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.260]   where he says, "Be fruitful and multiply,
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.860]   "fill the earth and subdue it."
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.000]   He's saying that the first great commission, listen,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.800]   God's first great commission is simply this.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.280]   I've created man and I've created woman
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.720]   and I've created them in such a way that they fit together
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.000]   and when they fit together, life is brought forth
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.060]   and if she loves God and he loves God,
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.320]   they would create babies that love God
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.920]   and that they would cover the earth
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.840]   with babies that love God, that have babies that love God,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.660]   that have babies that love God.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.300]   This is God's original plan.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.860]   This is the first great commission
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.920]   that we would produce disciples through reproduction
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.740]   but we've moved so far from that.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:43.460]   We've taken this plan and captured it for our pleasure
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.800]   and excitement and the manic highs and the manic lows
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.240]   and friends, culture's model is so broken.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.860]   It's so flawed and it's not just flawed and broken,
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.480]   it's damaging you.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.460]   It's hurting you.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.360]   It's wound, I don't, it's very easy for me
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.680]   to prove this to you that culture's model,
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.100]   which is self-focused, that it prepares you for divorce,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.340]   not commitment and it's ultimately one of the biggest
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.820]   failures of the 21st century
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.060]   and the vast majority of those cute Instagram pictures
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.040]   that you saw today are going to end in flames,
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.060]   in disaster, in devastation, they will not make it
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.940]   and I know that's not the uplifting message
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.380]   you wanted right now but it's just the truth.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.020]   It's just the facts.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.460]   So you gotta do something different.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.300]   You gotta do something revolutionary.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.400]   You gotta do something incredibly different
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.280]   than what the world would have you do
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.720]   because the fact of the matter is 80% of you
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.740]   are going to get married at least one time in your life
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.940]   and God really cares about marriage
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.900]   and so you cannot afford to be influenced by the culture
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.500]   on this topic anymore.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.440]   It's in desperate need of a revolution.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   And ladies, I've spent enough time with you to know
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.400]   that when I said 80%, all of you felt like the 20%
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.540]   that aren't gonna get married
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.360]   and you just thought oh no, that's gonna be me.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.480]   I'm gonna be a part of that, stop it.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.280]   Okay, that's my most loving advice to you right now,
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.600]   stop it, okay?
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.840]   Stop dwelling in that, start trusting God,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.600]   believing that he has a plan for you
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.500]   and that his plan is better than yours
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.000]   and pursue that plan
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.580]   and ask him to help you know that plan.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.560]   And if you're here and you wanna be married,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.660]   I want you to know I want you to be married
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.780]   and not just married,
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.220]   I want you to have an incredible marriage.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.140]   I take great delight in watching couples come in here
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.500]   and get married and really have a ministry
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.940]   that is produced out of that covenant relationship.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.060]   It is one of my greatest joys
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.220]   and one of my greatest honors to watch that every week
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.860]   and I see it happen all the time
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.460]   and it truly is, it's one of the key reasons that I do this.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.780]   So I hope that you would have an incredible marriage,
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.580]   an incredible ministry together
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.100]   but to do so you're gonna have to learn what God says.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.880]   So we're talking about revolutionary dating,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.780]   we're in this series New Year Revolution,
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.220]   we subtitled it Changes People Make That Change The World
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.220]   and I will tell you we didn't just cram this topic in here.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.940]   This is one of the key things that I think you can do,
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.500]   a change that you can make
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.440]   that will actually change the world,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.260]   go back to God's original great commission
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.320]   and so we know that dating is not in the Bible
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.220]   and here's why it's not in the Bible.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.500]   Maybe you know it's not in the Bible
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.540]   but maybe you don't know why.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.940]   Dating is a very new idea.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.220]   Now when I say new idea, I don't know what you think.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.340]   Dating is about 100 years old.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.980]   So only about a century old, that's it.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.720]   Like in the early 1900s, the late 1800s,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.940]   dating was a euphemism for prostitution.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.060]   That's where the word shows up in our language
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.340]   and if you said in the late 1800s, I'm gonna go on a date,
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.980]   what that meant is you were going to solicit sex
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.380]   from a prostitute and pay for it.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.740]   Now that's not a joke.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.700]   That I'm serious, that's where we get the word dating from.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.300]   Now you can see what has happened in the past 100 years
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.860]   that we would use it, throw it around
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.560]   and it would be very normal
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.660]   and we think that we're getting better at this
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.620]   because we have apps and personality profiles
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.100]   and we have all of these matchmaking tools
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.700]   but statistically, friends, I need you to wake up,
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.200]   we're getting worse at it.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.860]   We're getting married less, we're getting married later
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.500]   and then those marriages are failing more.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.900]   Can we all just open our eyes and see
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.260]   that we are getting a whole lot worse at this?
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.060]   We've got to return to the original intentions.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.220]   The one who invented it, the one who made it up,
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.340]   you're going to have to unlearn some things tonight,
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.640]   to undo some things tonight.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.840]   Test everything I say,
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.140]   see if it's consistent with the scriptures,
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.820]   see if you desire to apply it.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.620]   I'm gonna be in Genesis chapter 24.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.340]   If you wanna turn there, Genesis chapter 24.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.820]   First book of the Bible, 24 chapters in.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.300]   It's gonna be the story of Isaac and Rebekah.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.060]   The Old Testament is full of love stories
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.980]   of Ruth and Boaz and Jacob and Rachel,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.740]   Esther, Samson and Delilah.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.620]   All of them have weird things going on
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.780]   and so we don't tell these stories as prescriptive,
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.020]   like hey, you should do it just like Samson and Delilah,
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.900]   don't get a haircut.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.900]   No, it's descriptive of an actual relationship
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.380]   but inside that description, there are eternal truths
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.220]   and principles that the Bible repeats
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.780]   that we can begin to apply into our own relationships.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.540]   So tonight, I'm going to give you three things
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.900]   everyone can do today to begin to revolutionize dating.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.100]   Whether you have a prospect or not,
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.900]   everyone can start doing these three things tonight.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.620]   You can begin and it will help you in this adventure.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.740]   So let me summarize this very lengthy text.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.620]   Abraham's wife, Sarah, has just passed away
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.580]   and there's kind of like this,
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.020]   oh no, I've got a son and he's single
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.780]   and his mama's no longer around to help him be sensitive.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.260]   Like I've got to find this man or woman fast
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.940]   and so he calls his servant, his main servant,
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.660]   his lead servant over, Eleazar, and he says,
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.860]   I need you to go find a wife for my son.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.660]   But here's the deal, like I'm surrounded by non-believers
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.020]   here in the promised land, surrounded by the Canaanites.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.580]   You're going to have to go to my hometown
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.820]   and find a girl from there
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   and so can you travel to my hometown?
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.660]   You would often see in the Old Testament
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.100]   people married within their family.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.340]   Today that's weird and even gross, okay?
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.020]   Different things going on at this time.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.180]   Keep in mind, if you're going to marry a believer,
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.620]   she's going to come from your family.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.580]   Very few believers on the planet Earth at this time.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.300]   And so this was God's plan to purify the faith
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.260]   and again, as I told you,
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.060]   roll out that original Great Commission.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.660]   So he sends his servant to his hometown.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.900]   Eleazar goes to a well, a water well,
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.980]   and he prays and says, God,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.660]   would you show me a woman for my master
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.820]   who would not only get me a drink,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.700]   but also for my camels, that she would be the one.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.100]   He prays that prayer, lo and behold,
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   Rebecca shows up on the scene, offers him some water.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.460]   He goes home to meet her family,
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.060]   tells her of the mission that he,
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.300]   tells them of the mission that he's on.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.420]   And then he and Rebecca return back to the promised land,
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.020]   back to Abraham's house,
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.060]   where she can meet his son, Isaac,
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.060]   who is in the field praying
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.260]   as he's waiting on them to return.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.580]   And they meet, they get married,
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.100]   they have sex or intimate, I should say.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.340]   And then it says, he loves her.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.780]   He loves her the rest of his life.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.380]   And so the very first practical thing you can do
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.340]   starting tonight is you can pray.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.220]   Super practical, super easy,
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.700]   you can do it right now where you're sitting.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.940]   It says in verse 12,
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.820]   then he prayed, Lord God, my master Abraham,
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.460]   make me, Lord God of my master Abraham,
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.900]   make me successful today
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.580]   and show kindness to my master Abraham.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.340]   See, I am standing beside this spring
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.980]   and the daughters of the townspeople
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.980]   are coming out to draw water.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.740]   May it be that when I say to a young woman,
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.620]   please let down your jar that I may have a drink.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.020]   And she says, drink and I'll have water at drink
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.100]   and I'll water your camels too.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.460]   Let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.500]   By this I will know that you have shown kindness
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.740]   to my master.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.980]   Now there's clearly something supernatural happening here.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.860]   I'm not encouraging you necessarily to pray this specific.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.700]   Lord, as I walk into this Starbucks,
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.700]   I pray that a woman would come up to me
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.140]   and offer me a venti nonfat white chocolate frappuccino
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:31.580]   and some for my dog.
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.220]   And that she would be the one
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.140]   that I'd spend the rest of my life with.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.580]   And Father, I pray that she is a believer
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.380]   and a supermodel.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.340]   And that's how she raises money for charity.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.380]   But consider what he did pray.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:58.620]   Please provide someone and make it clear who it is.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.780]   Simple prayer.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.060]   Please provide someone and make it clear who it is.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   And so why wouldn't you pray every day for your spouse?
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.460]   And when I say pray for your spouse,
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.740]   I don't mean like a request, like a Christmas present,
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.860]   like I pray for that new car.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.580]   I mean pray for them in the sense of,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.500]   Lord, I pray that you're protecting them.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.500]   Lord, I pray that you're preserving them.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.060]   Lord, I pray that they know you and walk with you,
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.860]   that you would protect their innocence and their purity.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.180]   Help them in this broken world.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.340]   Father, help them.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.700]   Should I live long enough to meet them?
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.660]   I pray that they know you and walk with you
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.420]   and be saved by you and filled with your Holy Spirit.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.020]   You could pray for them every single day.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.260]   See, I think one of the first revelations
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.300]   that we're gonna have in heaven is this, prayer works.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.180]   One of the first things that we're gonna get up there
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.540]   and realize is like, wow, you were really listening.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.140]   And me talking to you was really doing something
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.500]   and there was an alignment of your heart and mine
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.660]   and your desires and mine.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.540]   And man, I wish I would have done that more.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.940]   There was just a part of me that doubted
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.540]   that you were actually listening, that you actually cared,
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.820]   that you actually asked me,
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.460]   that you wanted me to ask for things.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.060]   I wouldn't tell you to do this
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.820]   if I didn't practice it every single night.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.740]   I pray for my kids' spouses.
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.580]   Every single night I go into my daughter's room,
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.060]   Presley and Finley, and I go into my son's room.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.620]   And with my daughters, I say,
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.500]   Lord, I pray for their husbands.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.380]   They would know you and fear you,
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.340]   that they'd walk with you,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.700]   that you'd protect their innocence,
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.340]   that you'd preserve their purity.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.300]   Father, that they would know your word,
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.020]   that they would treat these women well,
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.060]   that they would meet each other in your perfect timing.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.860]   Father, would you align their hearts with your will
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.460]   and with what you're doing?
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.300]   Amen.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.620]   And then what happens is usually they,
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.580]   this has happened both times,
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.580]   they turn to me and said,
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.260]   Daddy, what's a spouse?
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.260]   And so we have to work through that.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.140]   But every night I do that.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.260]   Can you consider how profound that is?
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.380]   That there is two men out there that I've never met,
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.820]   but I prayed for every day.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.260]   Every day I pray for their faith
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.140]   and their relationship with God
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.460]   and the way that they're going to treat my daughters.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.660]   Every day I pray for them.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.780]   I don't think that so many of us
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.220]   want a God-honoring marriage,
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.820]   we just want a relationship.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.620]   We just want someone.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.140]   Like our goals for ourselves
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.420]   are so much lower than God's goals for us.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.180]   And so the gifts that we give ourselves
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.020]   are so much lower than the gifts God has for us.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.140]   We just want a relationship.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.620]   And sometimes that causes us to take shortcuts,
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.220]   to settle for the fake roses, if you will.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.340]   I remember when I went to,
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.940]   had the privilege and honor to do David's wedding,
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.780]   David and Marvin.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.060]   And I remember being at his rehearsal dinner
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:24.300]   as his mom stood up and looked at his beautiful wife,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.220]   very godly, God-fearing wife.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.220]   And she just had this opportunity to tell her,
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.260]   "I've prayed for you, for my son, for decades now.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.340]   "Long before we met, I prayed for you,
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.180]   "that he would meet you."
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.820]   It's just a crazy thing to look someone in the eyes
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.260]   who is the answer to your prayer.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.420]   Why wouldn't you do that every day?
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.580]   If you desire marriage,
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.180]   why would you not pray for your spouse every day,
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.940]   not just to meet them, but that God would align your heart?
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.900]   And sometimes girls are like, "Can I do that?
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.740]   "Are you sure?
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.980]   "Is that gonna feed my control?"
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.620]   Listen, you could pray for whatever you want
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.540]   'cause God knows you want it, right?
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.100]   I mean, it's not like he doesn't know
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.740]   and you're trying to play some mind tricks with God.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.780]   He's like, "God, I really wanna marry him,
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.340]   "but I wouldn't dare ask you."
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.900]   That's crazy.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.220]   Ask him for what you want.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.300]   Just ask him for what he wants.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.060]   You can ask God for whatever you want.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.220]   Just ask in line of asking him for what you want.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.260]   Say, "God, would you show me what you want?
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.780]   "And would you give me a greater desire in my heart
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.900]   "for what you want than for what I want?
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.660]   "If what I want is not what you want,
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.460]   "would you change that in me?"
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.540]   You can pray that every single day relentlessly.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.780]   Pray for what you want while seeking what he wants.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.260]   The next very practical thing that you can do
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.220]   beginning tonight is pursue purity.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.460]   Tonight.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:54.020]   Guys, think about how crazy this would be.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.500]   Think about from this moment on to the day you're buried.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.940]   What if you never saw another woman's breast
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.860]   other than the woman you married?
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.100]   How amazing would that be?
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.820]   I mean, I'm talking you screen movies,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.700]   you go to Kids in Mind or Plugged In,
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.900]   and you see if there's nudity there,
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.180]   and if there is, you avoid it like the plague.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:21.460]   And you tell her, "On your 60th wedding anniversary,
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.120]   "your breast is the only breast I've seen
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.420]   "for the past 60, 65 years."
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:32.980]   I think that's God's desire and design even.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.900]   And it's beautiful.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.940]   You pursue purity, verse 15.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.900]   "Before he had finished praying,
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.740]   "Rebecca came out with her jar on her shoulder.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.140]   "She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah,
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.340]   "who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.180]   "The woman was very beautiful, a virgin.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.180]   "No man had ever slept with her."
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.980]   Pursue purity.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.940]   You can do this with no prospect in mind.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.060]   You can pursue personal purity.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.980]   You can pursue the content,
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.660]   or you can withstand from the content
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.540]   that you put before your eyes.
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.140]   Abstain from any sexual content.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.180]   You can pursue personal purity.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.340]   I don't think we have any idea
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.380]   what a big deal purity is to God.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.100]   We're so far from his values when it comes to this.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.980]   And I don't know if we know each other.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.660]   You may be a guest here for the first time,
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.260]   and so you may not know my story,
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.340]   that I was a sex addict and a porn addict for a long time.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.860]   And have found freedom through my relationship
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.940]   with Jesus Christ in the context of community
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.500]   within the church.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.060]   And so I'm very passionate about this
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.820]   'cause I've experienced the heartbreak,
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.460]   the heartache, the pain, and the devastation
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.300]   that sex outside of marriage and pornography
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.820]   and masturbation causes in the context of marriage.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.140]   Not only have I personally,
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.820]   but then I've counseled hundreds and hundreds
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.700]   and hundreds of couples in a very same
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.900]   and similar situation.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.620]   And so I just got one message for you.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.420]   It's the world is lying to you, man.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.020]   You are being duped.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.340]   You are being defrauded.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.060]   And I really need you to believe this
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.300]   or test it or wrestle with it
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   or get your stats and your facts
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.540]   and your proof and your evidence.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.220]   You try to argue against what I'm saying right now
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.220]   because I'm telling you those small decisions
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.100]   that you're making right now at 18, 21, 35,
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.500]   they are costing you a healthy marriage
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.100]   long before you even meet a prospect.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.940]   It's hurting you.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.220]   It is not helping you in any way.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.300]   No one has ever said in the history of all creation,
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.260]   man, my marriage is so much better
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.660]   because of porn and masturbation.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.060]   I'm an amazing lover
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.260]   because of the time that I spent looking at porn
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.620]   and masturbating
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.660]   or the ways that I got to practice sex outside of marriage.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.900]   No, you are poisoning that flower bed.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.300]   Beautiful things will not be able to bloom from that bed
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.620]   unless you put in work right now.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.500]   And I say that out of love.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.260]   And so some of, I hear every now and then,
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.580]   I was like, JP, does the Bible really say explicitly
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.500]   not to have sex?
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.540]   I mean, does the Bible really say,
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.940]   those are the words of Satan.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.420]   Does the Bible, did God really say?
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.260]   In Deuteronomy 22, verse 21,
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.500]   it actually says that if you could not prove
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.620]   that a woman was a virgin, she could be stoned.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:36.780]   Now, praise God for Jesus and the new covenant and grace.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.660]   We don't live under that law anymore.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.180]   But the reason that I tell you that
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.980]   is because you have to understand the context
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.340]   of which the scriptures were written into.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.500]   God's line for you is not to not have sex.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.580]   It's so far before that,
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.380]   that you would flee sexual immorality.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.460]   That's 1 Corinthians 6, 18 and 20.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.660]   Flee sexual immorality.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.620]   All other sins a man commits are outside his body.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.100]   But whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.260]   Do you not know that your body is the temple
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.020]   of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.620]   whom you've received from God?
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.580]   You are not your own.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.940]   You've been bought at a price.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.660]   Therefore, honor God with your body.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.580]   If you are running toward Jesus,
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.220]   you're running from sexual immorality.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.940]   It's not how close can I get?
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.820]   It's not make out sessions or anything like,
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.740]   hey, anything but sex or what kind of sex is okay.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.860]   None of it's okay.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.700]   Sexting, texting, none of it's okay.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.060]   You're so far from where God's ideals are.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:39.020]   Every one of those actions is hurting you, costing you.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.060]   And you're like, man, that's crazy.
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.060]   That's so far from the world.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.600]   You better believe it is.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.980]   Keep taking advice from the world.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.140]   You wanna get married five times?
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.780]   Keep taking advice from the world.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.740]   Man, you want the world's track record?
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.580]   Marriage?
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.420]   Keep going.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.900]   Could you just lean in a little bit and listen
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.260]   and consider what you're doing?
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.840]   Consider who you're taking advice from.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.220]   Hebrews 13, verse four says,
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.580]   "Marriage should be honored by all
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.120]   "and the marriage bed kept pure,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.320]   "for God will judge the adulterer
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.300]   "and all the sexually immoral."
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.020]   Now listen, I know that,
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.500]   'cause I've given this message and I've talked to people
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.520]   and I've had 'em weep up here.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.360]   And again, I want you to remind you of my story.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.580]   I know that you feel condemnation with those words.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.580]   Listen, you can't restart tonight.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.420]   That's the beauty of the gospel.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.060]   It's God's no longer counting their sins against them.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.460]   He's removed their transgressions
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.540]   as far as the east from the west.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.460]   These are all scriptures I'm giving you right now.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.540]   That you can go right now and say, God, I've been a fool.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.260]   I've done some really stupid things
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.740]   and I wanna start over.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.260]   I believe your spirit is powerful.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.380]   Can you help me start over?
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.100]   Satan is a liar and he's telling me
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.180]   that I'm guilty right now.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.900]   Can you set me free from that?
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.620]   Can you help me stop feeding the desires of my stomach
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.320]   and begin to flee sexual immorality?
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.460]   What is sexual immorality?
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.500]   How do you know when I'm moving towards sexual?
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.580]   And when your body begins to prepare itself for sex
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.960]   outside of marriage,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.000]   because that's what it is outside of marriage, it's sex.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.800]   And there's some of you here tonight,
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.060]   there's some of you listening to this,
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.140]   all you will ever have is sex.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.040]   But when God talks about intimacy within marriage,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.660]   that's not the word he uses.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.200]   It's so much better than that.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.760]   That's the world's word.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.360]   He has something for you so much better than that
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.340]   and it comes with work.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.920]   Like any five-year-old can paint a picture,
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.360]   but it ain't gonna be pretty.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.960]   And any two-year-old can strum a guitar,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.400]   but it ain't gonna be pretty.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.720]   And in the same way, I can plant flowers in dirt,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.300]   but they ain't gonna be pretty.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.800]   To make things pretty takes work and discipline,
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:31:00.040]   effort, patience, perseverance,
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.140]   not doing what you wanna do, seeking God's desire.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.600]   And so how profound is this that practicing purity
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.400]   is equipping you for real marital intimacy?
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.320]   Practicing sex is preparing you for disaster.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   And we've trained for sex outside of marriage,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.900]   so we will never be, the person who's training
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.120]   with sex outside of marriage will never be satisfied
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.240]   by sex inside of marriage
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.440]   because they're two different things.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.120]   If you've trained for sex outside of marriage,
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.880]   you will not be satisfied by intimacy inside of marriage
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.320]   because you have fed yourself
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.480]   for an appetite of something else.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.200]   They are different.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.500]   That comes from a man who's had both.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.440]   And if you're looking at porn,
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.080]   it's a university for how to be a miserable lover.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:55.760]   Pornography is a college, a classroom to teach you
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.400]   how to be a miserable lover.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.840]   You need to stop now.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.360]   But consider with me for just a moment
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.480]   how brilliant God's design is.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.900]   That God gifted this act to us that He made the parts
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.880]   and He made them work the way that they do.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.920]   He made them male and female
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.100]   and He put the reproductive organs inside of her
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.640]   so that she can grow human life.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.320]   And then as just a bonus and a gift to us,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.640]   He made it feel good.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.040]   Thank you, God.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.520]   The masterful designer.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.160]   And the scripture said the two become one flesh.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.540]   And what God has brought together, let man not separate.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.680]   They can't be separated because they bonded.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.160]   And now modern science tells us, modern science says
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.320]   that when an adult experiences sex,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.740]   more specifically orgasm,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.080]   that their brain is creating a synapse
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.520]   that bonds them to their surroundings.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.440]   Let me say that again in case you missed it.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.420]   Whenever a human being experiences orgasm by themselves
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.520]   or with someone else,
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.620]   their brain is literally sticking themselves to an object.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.560]   That they are bonding to that object.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.720]   That their body is training them,
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.400]   hey, that thing that you just saw,
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.560]   that you just looked at,
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.360]   made you feel really, really good, pursue it.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.660]   Now you can imagine that if that only happens
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.000]   between a man and a woman for a lifetime,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.880]   when her body changes shape and she ages,
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.360]   that she remains the epitome of attraction to Him.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.280]   How beautiful is God's design?
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   But that when you take that design
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.120]   and you bond to two-dimensional images
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.480]   and computers and magazines and things and Instagram
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.880]   and anything else that you would look at,
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.560]   that you're not growing an addiction to sex,
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.960]   you're growing an addiction
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.920]   to two-dimensional counterfeit images,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.720]   things that will never satisfy you
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.840]   in a marriage relationship,
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.360]   they just won't happen.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.960]   And I don't mean it because I know I just like,
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.440]   like the vast majority of you,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.840]   I'm talking to you like you're talking to me,
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.800]   I'm talking to you.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.520]   You gotta stop.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.400]   You got to stop!
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.240]   Like now, behind you, never again,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.400]   whatever it takes, remove access,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.960]   get rid of the phone, get rid of the computer,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.000]   do anything 'cause it's killing you
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   and it's killing your marriage.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.800]   And I'm not playing.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.000]   I'm so sick and tired of having someone
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.440]   stand in front of me, weeping from the devastation.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.400]   Why didn't you tell me?
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.600]   I told you, I've been there.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.640]   I've been there and you're gonna be there
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.560]   unless you stop.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.960]   And you can choose today or next week,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.320]   but all you did between now and next week
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.140]   is fed an appetite so that next week
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.780]   it's going to be more difficult.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.680]   That's it.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.500]   Or right now, you say I'm done.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.000]   You could text somebody right now and say,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.920]   hey, I'm an addict, I need help.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.240]   Right, there's some of you in relationships
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.320]   and you're sitting beside each other
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.400]   and you know you're sexually active
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.900]   and this is extremely awkward.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.440]   Thank you for trusting us with your Valentine's Day.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.960]   And stop.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.800]   Like love each other so much that you say,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.300]   hey, I'm gonna persevere.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.360]   I'm gonna show you that I only want intimacy
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.400]   within marriage.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   I care about you that much.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.220]   And we're gonna stop.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.080]   (breathing)
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:49.540]   The next very practical thing you can do
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:54.700]   today is practice serving.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:01.200]   Today, you can practice serving.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.240]   You can practice serving.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.680]   She went down to the spring, filled her jar,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.680]   and came up again.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.060]   The servant hurried to meet her and said,
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.900]   please give me a little water from your jar.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.600]   Drink, my Lord, she said, and quickly lowered the jar
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.340]   to her hands and gave him a drink.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.640]   After she had given him a drink,
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.280]   she said, I'll draw water for your camel too
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.880]   until they have had enough to drink.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.800]   So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough,
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.440]   ran back to the well to draw more water,
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.080]   and drew enough for his camels.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.440]   Without saying a word, the man watched her closely
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.420]   to learn whether or not the Lord
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.700]   has made his journey successful.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:51.880]   There's something really crazy happening
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.960]   when we read it like this.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.820]   We don't realize that this well,
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.160]   and I saw it was in Israel,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.100]   and I've seen wells, cisterns like this.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.120]   There's flights of stairs that she would be going down,
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.240]   that she would come and say, are you thirsty?
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.080]   And she doesn't just say, oh, if you're thirsty,
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.840]   let me get water for your camels too.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.240]   This is a servant woman that she would go
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.360]   and take these jars down these flights of stairs,
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.120]   deep into the cistern, fill them up, come back up,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.160]   pour them for the camels, then go back down.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.560]   Come back up and then pour.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.800]   That this was happening, and it says that he sits back
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.840]   and that he observes her first of all, right?
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.680]   He goes where women who serve hang out.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.840]   Like these women, they're not there.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.920]   It's not like a water fountain.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.960]   They're not there to get water for themselves.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.120]   They're there to serve others in their family
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.480]   and others around them.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.720]   And so there's just some practical takeaways for us, right?
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   Like if you're looking for a godly woman or a godly man,
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.080]   go where godly women or godly men hang out.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.420]   That, and listen, just because they're here
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.560]   doesn't mean they're godly, right?
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.400]   Like they may have a Bible and have memorized some verses,
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.000]   and yet they're just a bad boy looking for a good girl.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.360]   That's happening right now tonight, okay?
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.960]   So just because they're here doesn't mean they're godly.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.660]   You're gonna have to observe them.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.160]   Don't just take that Bible verse at face value.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.640]   And minute that's you, if you're here for the wrong reasons,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.480]   we'll find you.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.700]   We will find you.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.780]   That's all.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.960]   And so if you want to meet a bar fly,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.080]   you know you go to the bar.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.000]   If you wanna meet a girl that likes to party, right?
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.280]   You go to the club.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.320]   And a guy, it goes both ways, right?
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.600]   But if you wanna meet a godly man or a godly woman,
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.120]   go where godly men and godly women hang out, step one.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.840]   And there's a reason that Abraham can send his servant
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.120]   to find a wife for his son.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.920]   He doesn't need an app or a personality profile or anything.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.480]   He's just like, hey, make sure she loves God,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.180]   make sure she's kind, go find her.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.960]   It's just this really practical thing.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.040]   Hey, go find someone who loves God,
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:00.040]   and see if she'll be a good mom and a good wife.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.600]   That's what you're looking for.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.960]   Will they be a good mom?
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.800]   Will they be a good wife?
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.120]   Will he be a good dad and a good husband?
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.600]   Not does he have a six pack?
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.560]   That's gonna be practical for about six months,
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.760]   that six pack.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.880]   And then it's going to be a novelty,
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.660]   like a worthless commodity, that six pack.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:23.040]   I'm saying that, I love you guys, please.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.840]   Who will be a good mom?
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.720]   When she leaves in verse 60,
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.280]   they actually pray that she would have lots of children,
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.980]   and then they pray for her children, her family does.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.120]   To be a good mom, you gotta be a great servant.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.780]   That's what motherhood is, it's serving a lot.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.940]   And so he's looking for someone who is kind and who serves.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.560]   And so he observes her action, right?
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.400]   He's there at the well.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.840]   He observes her as she's serving.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.720]   This is so much less awkward than observing her
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.240]   when she's sunbathing or when she's playing volleyball
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.360]   or anything else out there, right?
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.720]   Like you wanna go and be in an environment
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.600]   where Christians, followers of Christ, are serving,
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.120]   where they're caring for others,
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.000]   and you wanna see how people do
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.280]   not just what they feel like doing,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.400]   but they push through their own desires
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.680]   to pursue God's desires against what they may feel.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.240]   That they're pursuing their calling and their purpose
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.640]   as a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.480]   that they're actually following Christ,
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.340]   and this takes some time.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.680]   I love the way that it just describes
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   that he kind of sits back and he just watches her.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.800]   He's not just taking her word for it.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.840]   Like imagine if Eleazar would have showed up on the scene
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.800]   and said, "Excuse me, ladies.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.840]   "Excuse me, ladies.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.920]   "Yeah, my master's very wealthy.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.960]   "Far away land.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   "He's got some estates and stuff.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.240]   "And he's looking for a wife,
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.160]   "but she's gotta be a servant.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.000]   "Any of you servants?"
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.980]   Like they're all gonna be like,
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.840]   "Uh, I am, I'm a servant."
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.400]   And he doesn't do that.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.880]   He doesn't just take their word for it.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.300]   He says, "Hey, I wanna see your track record.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.360]   "I wanna see, you're not impressed by me.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.880]   "You don't owe me anything."
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.160]   Like so much like when we're dating,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.200]   we're just like on this incessant interview
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.680]   and putting our best foot forward and stuff.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.660]   Proverbs 31 says, "Charm is deceitful
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.920]   "and beauty is fleeting.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.660]   "But a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.080]   Every single morning as I take my children to school,
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.180]   my kids, my girls rather, three days a week,
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.060]   before they get out of my truck,
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.660]   they have to say this verse from memory.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.780]   Every morning, three days a week, I take them to school.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.180]   Girls, tell me Proverbs 31, 30.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.140]   "Charm is deceitful."
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.680]   'Cause I want them to know charm is deceitful.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.220]   And I want them to know beauty is fleeting.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.620]   And I want them to be above all things
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.300]   a woman who fears the Lord.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:47.480]   And so my friends, I'm asking you to serve and observe.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.500]   I think the reason that so many marriages fail today
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.480]   is because we're looking at it in regards
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.820]   to what can I get from it?
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.020]   What can marriage do for me?
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.020]   But the number one job, your number one job in marriage
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:41:59.840]   is to serve.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.260]   You can write down these verses if you want.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.560]   Ephesians 5, verses 21 through 33.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.820]   Colossians 3, verses 18 through 19.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.100]   And 1 Peter 3, verses one through seven.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.420]   I'll give them again.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.980]   Ephesians 5, 21 to 33.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.420]   Colossians 3, 18 to 19.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.200]   And 1 Peter 3, one through seven.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.280]   All show God's desire in a marriage relationship.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.720]   All talk about serving each other.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.840]   Ephesians 5, 21 says, "Submit to one another
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.700]   "out of reverence for Christ."
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.800]   So let's have some real talk real quick
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.120]   as if we haven't already.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.020]   And so I'm talking to Monica,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.380]   I got a couple of weeks ago, my wife.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.000]   This is marriage talk now.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.380]   And I just say, "Babe, what makes you wanna be intimate?"
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.540]   Told you this is real talk.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.780]   What makes you want to be intimate?
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.420]   And I think like as a single person, you think,
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.660]   "Well, I know, you know, if you wear that thing
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.900]   "and the light hits you just right
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.460]   "and you got boys to men on and rose petals."
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.740]   That's not what she's, she did not hesitate.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.700]   She didn't think about it for two seconds.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.060]   This is her, I love her answer.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.740]   It's so true.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.560]   She says, "When you remove responsibilities."
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.440]   When you remove responsibilities,
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.380]   because during the day there's three kids tugging at me
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.660]   and I'm making lunches and I'm cleaning the house
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.320]   and I'm doing this and I'm doing that.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.900]   And when you come on the scene
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.820]   and you're taking out the trash and you're helping out,
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.660]   that makes me want you.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.740]   And I will tell you something,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.680]   that she's not alone in that.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.220]   I've heard from a lot of women
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.260]   and read books on the topics
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.720]   and they all feel the same way.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.760]   It turns out foreplay for them is taking out the trash.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:50.860]   And it really is.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.240]   And you think, "No, it's not, not for me.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.420]   "It's gonna be, we're gonna be on the."
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.120]   Yeah, maybe not on the honeymoon.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.200]   Like maybe not for two months,
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.280]   but I'm telling you six months in,
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.960]   what you're going to be doing in marriage
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.880]   is a lot of serving each other.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.040]   And so you better be really, really, really good
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.600]   at serving people.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.040]   And you can practice that right now.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:20.100]   The weight of responsibilities is an enemy to intimacy.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:25.480]   Verse 66, "Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.340]   "Isaac," they've returned home now,
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.680]   "Isaac brought her, Rebekah,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.140]   "into the tent of his mother Sarah
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.320]   "and he married Rebekah.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.840]   "So she became his wife and he loved her.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.320]   "And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.120]   The word loved her there is interesting.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.480]   You got two words to choose from in the Hebrew.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.160]   Could be hesed, which is the covenantal love.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.520]   You might even think that would go there,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.200]   but the word that they chose is ahava.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   Ahava, it means he gave himself to her.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.500]   Like an ongoing, continually sacrificial love,
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.980]   he gave of himself to her.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.780]   This is God's, and this is the beginning of them
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.460]   becoming one, starting a family.
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.260]   This is God's brilliant design that in the family unit
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.520]   there'd be a mom and a dad and they would love him
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.920]   and they'd produce offspring that would love him.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.260]   And you think, well, what if I didn't have that?
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.220]   You are in a beautiful place to tell the world
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.420]   how important it is if you didn't have that.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.080]   And to make sure that your children have that
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.120]   as best as you can.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.540]   What a beautiful place that you would be here
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.340]   in hearing this.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.100]   And God is the God of grace.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.740]   He moves in, the Holy Spirit moves in
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.260]   and covers a multitude of wrongs.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.480]   I praise him that he did in my life,
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.180]   that I've experienced his grace in the most real ways.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.580]   But I think that so many of us here this evening,
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.020]   we view marriage as the capstone and not the cornerstone.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.140]   See, historically speaking, you go 100 years ago,
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.380]   marriage was a cornerstone,
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.320]   you would build your life on top of it.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.240]   It was this very practical thing.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.500]   Now, right, you were kind of like, you know what?
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.620]   Life is hard and I need someone to go through life with me
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.320]   and I can't have children on my own and working is hard
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.380]   and there's just this thing that it's gonna be easier
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.620]   if I can find this other creation,
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.280]   this opposite sex that God created to compliment me
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.540]   so that we would go through life and ministry together.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:30.060]   It was a cornerstone that you'd build your life on.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.180]   Now, in the 21st century, we think of it more as a capstone.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.940]   We have to go out there and make money and become something
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.520]   and then after we become something,
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.140]   then we can pursue marriage just like the cherry on top
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.180]   because that's the only time we're gonna be able
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.460]   to afford a wedding, right?
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.220]   And that's broken.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.720]   Like stop taking marriage advice from the world.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.740]   That's broken.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.280]   You're missing out on one of God's beautiful blessings.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.400]   Of marriage and I know some of you hear that
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.000]   and you feel so helpless and I'm praying
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.780]   that the opposite sex would hear it too.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:10.680]   I asked a friend of mine who was actually on The Bachelor.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.600]   He was one of those two still together.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.280]   I asked him some questions this week
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:20.160]   and I've been impressed with his authenticity
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.800]   and I know he seeks to honor Christ
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.760]   and it's imperfect like all of us
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.400]   but I said, where do you feel like we miss it
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.120]   in the dating culture of 2017?
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:36.080]   And Sean said, I feel like so many people,
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.720]   particularly women, have this bachelor
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.920]   or fairy tale view of dating and marriage.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.800]   In other words, they're waiting to find Mr. or Mrs. Right
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.240]   and when they do, they'll know it,
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.600]   fall in love and spend the rest of their life
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.280]   with that euphoric feeling.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.840]   Truth is, God never tells us
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.560]   that there's one right person for us.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.440]   God shows us how to love, how to treat our spouse
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.000]   and how to run our household.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.660]   I think many who are dating need to realize
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.440]   that their fairy tale ending will only be achieved
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.360]   after putting in the work and following God's desire.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.100]   And I said, what has been the biggest surprise in marriage?
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.120]   What has been the biggest surprise in marriage?
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:19.260]   And he says this, the biggest surprise in marriage
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.560]   has been just how much work it's taken.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.960]   Unprompted.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.320]   I always heard that marriage was work,
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.240]   but I didn't truly understand the challenges
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.560]   that come from melding two worlds together.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.100]   We were raised differently, handled conflict differently,
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.280]   had differing political views at times,
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.440]   had different ways of handling finance.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.800]   The list goes on and on.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.400]   Together, we have to learn how to meld
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.840]   those two ways of living together.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.440]   Yes, you do, it takes work.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.240]   Two selfish people coming together,
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.600]   to being committed to being unselfish towards one another.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.080]   That's what marriage is.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.220]   Two selfish people coming together,
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.940]   committing to being unselfish towards one another.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.400]   It takes work.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.140]   You can start right now.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:09.500]   Even if you don't have a prospect, you can start right now.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.000]   You have a role to play in marriage.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.500]   You can even consider what are the qualities and the skills
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.560]   that would make me a good husband or a good wife,
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.160]   and how can I go and pursue them?
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.960]   'Cause we're all becoming something.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.460]   And good wives and good husbands don't just happen.
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.260]   They start when you're 18, when you're 22,
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.620]   when you're 35, that you would pray,
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.560]   that you would pursue purity,
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.760]   and that you would practice serving.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:44.820]   That is my prayer for you, that you would pray,
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:48.040]   that you would relentlessly pursue purity,
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:53.420]   and that now, that you would begin serving
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.340]   and observing as you consider who you might spend
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.700]   the rest of your life with.
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:05.060]   This is a rose.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.980]   Today, this is how we show people that we love them,
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.620]   particularly on this day.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.140]   What I want you to know about this rose,
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.060]   as beautiful as it is, and it's beautiful, it's dying.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:23.140]   And there's nothing that you can do
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.940]   to make it stay beautiful.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.860]   There's nothing that you can do to preserve this rose,
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.900]   to give life back into it from the moment
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.660]   that it was cut from the source, it is dying.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:40.140]   And friends, if I have any message for you this evening,
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:45.400]   your relationships are the exact same way.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.760]   All those Instagram photos, all those cute couples,
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.740]   if they have removed themselves
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.740]   from the source of love, those relationships are dying
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.580]   and will soon be dead.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.820]   And really, the sooner the better,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.780]   because all that's gonna happen between now and then
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.060]   is a lot of heartache.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.040]   And it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:17.100]   You can work, even now, you can begin to prepare
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:22.940]   the flower bed, you can begin to tend the garden,
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:28.140]   you can pray, ask for God's desires,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.700]   you can relentlessly pursue purity,
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.900]   you can take out all the weeds,
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.280]   you can practice serving, putting in the work
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.980]   that I'm telling you, and anybody else who's married
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:43.740]   would tell you marriage is, it's work, it's a lot of work,
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.220]   it's beautiful, it's a gift, it's a blessing.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.120]   And if you want it, I want it for you.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.980]   But you can't just go into it like it's this novel idea
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.140]   or you will be like the 50 plus percent
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.420]   that fail miserably.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:01.540]   And I hope, if you're here and you're hearing this,
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.420]   I hope you want a beautiful marriage.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:08.860]   And Jesus says, I am the vine, they are the branches.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.700]   And that if you're gonna bear fruit,
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.920]   if there's gonna be something that's beautiful,
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:19.180]   you must remain in him, you must stay connected
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:22.720]   to the source, the scripture says that God is love.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.140]   You cannot love in the way that it was meant,
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:31.440]   you cannot ahava, apart from God.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.780]   It's my prayers that you wouldn't even try.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:36.980]   Let me pray for you now.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:49.540]   Lord, I pray that we would never see a rose the same.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:57.000]   That we would know it's just a dying expression of love.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.780]   And that we would love to learn in a different way.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:08.360]   Not just sitting and waiting and hoping to be chosen.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:17.100]   But Father, preparing and working and pursuing
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.020]   and praying and practicing.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:26.260]   Father, that we would seek you and that we would find you
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.620]   and that we would stay connected to the source.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.680]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.700]   Man, I love you guys.
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:41.560]   I have seen preachers kind of lose it on stage,
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.560]   like lose control and like start yelling and stuff.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.840]   Kind of like promised I'd never do that.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.040]   Afraid I did that.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:57.160]   Please forgive me, especially if that would hinder
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.240]   your view of Jesus in any way or your view of the church.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:09.080]   That comes from a place of internal pain,
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.460]   not eternal pain, internal pain.
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:16.320]   Of the own devastation that I brought on my life
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.840]   and my wife's life through my own pursuit of pornography
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.920]   and sexual addiction.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.080]   And I have found true freedom.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.120]   Not that it's not a struggle today in the sense
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.720]   that I'm not tempted to click on hashtags
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:34.240]   or things on social media, sometimes click on a thumbnail
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.760]   like what is that, what I think it is?
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.900]   And I have certainly done that in the past 10 years.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.320]   But in regards to pursuing pornography,
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:47.240]   like searching out for a naked picture, I've been free.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.480]   I have found freedom and I say that to offer you hope.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.400]   That you would have hope in that.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.980]   And I've talked about this enough to know
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.320]   that what's gonna happen tomorrow
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.960]   is I'm gonna get dozens of emails.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.020]   And it reads something like this.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:08.820]   Hey, my story's similar to yours and I need help.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.240]   And I'm grateful that you'd reach out to me.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.100]   But I'm gonna tell you now, in case that's you,
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.000]   I'm just gonna, I'm gonna tell you what I'd say.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.280]   Then I'm gonna tell you right now.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.840]   You need to find some believers in your life.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.580]   You need to reach out to them.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.560]   You need to confess in a James 5, 16 way
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.100]   the last time you looked at porn and/or masturbated.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.200]   You need to tell them, hey, I wanna be set free from this.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.740]   Will you please keep asking me how I'm doing?
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.960]   In fact, would you meet with me weekly
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.100]   so that we can talk through this and experience community
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.300]   and that I can find freedom?
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.380]   And would you hold me accountable to praying for myself,
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.600]   for my own victory in this struggle?
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.000]   And would you help me to remove access
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.340]   to the ways that I access that filth?
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.480]   Would you help me?
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.820]   Man, that is as working in the dirt, man.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.280]   That is pulling out the weeds.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.080]   That's bringing in the organic soil, the good stuff.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.820]   And so that you might see something beautiful bloom forth.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.140]   And do not leave this place overridden by guilt.
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.380]   Guilt is from the enemy.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.000]   Guilt is Satan's language.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.180]   Christ has set you free.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.200]   He's paid for it.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.480]   God does not see a debt he paid for.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.200]   He does not see a debt he paid for.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   You can be free from debt and the penalty of sin
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:33.780]   and one day the presence of sin in his presence.
