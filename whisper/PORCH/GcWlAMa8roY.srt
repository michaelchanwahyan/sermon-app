4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,200
 Amazing, amazing.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,000
 We're continuing this series Skeptical where we just explore some of the big topics of the faith.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,600
 Anyone a hypochondriac in the room are willing to admit that a little bit?

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,200
 Afraid of the Ebola thing right now?

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,700
 A little?

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,400
 I am like totally a hypochondriac and my team gives me a hard time about it all the time.

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:14,800
 About two months ago, I was with Adam Tarnow who works on staff at Watermark and we were catching up and he explained how the day before he had been to the dermatologist and I'm going, "You go to the dermatologist?

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,300
 What do you do there?"

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:25,500
 And he begins to explain that he at one point had some sort of cancerous mole that was on his leg and he had to have it removed and I'm going, "Oh my gosh, how did you know?"

13
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,900
 And he said, "Well, I go regularly.

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,800
 You don't go regularly?"

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
 And I'm going, "What?

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 Am I supposed to go regularly?

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,900
 What?

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,500
 Which doctors am I supposed to make sure that I go to every year?"

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,000
 He said, "Yeah, you should go once a year and you're fair skin and so you probably got something."

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,100
 And so all of a sudden, yeah, which is encouraging.

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,100
 And so I am now thinking in my head, "I've never been to a dermatologist.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,600
 Maybe I need to go to a dermatologist."

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,700
 And then you go home and you're like looking everywhere and you're like, "This doesn't look normal at all."

24
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,300
 And so I make an appointment and I go and I'm going, "What if I do have something?

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,700
 I don't even know if I want to know if I have something."

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,500
 And so I get the appointment set.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:11,700
 I go in there, which is a really uncomfortable experience if you've ever gone to the dermatologist where you have to like shed everything and they're like closely examining you.

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,400
 Anyways, so I'm in there and the lady begins to explain and she finds something and she says, "Oh no.

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,500
 Oh no."

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,400
 And she says, "I think you have a diaplastic mole."

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,700
 And I'm going, "Diaplastic?

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,600
 That doesn't sound good.

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,000
 It's got the word 'die' in it.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,900
 What is a diaplastic mole?"

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,600
 And she says, "I don't think it's anything.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,700
 It could be cancerous, but really I'm not sure.

37
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,100
 Why don't we have it removed?"

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,700
 And I'm going, "Let's just take a 50/50 guess.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,800
 Give me your best estimate.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,500
 What do you think that it could be cancerous?"

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,000
 And she says, "Well, I really can't tell.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
 Anything that I would guess wouldn't be accurate.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,700
 Let's have it removed and then we'll send you the results."

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,200
 And of course, the results take like weeks to get.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,600
 And so you're like, "This diaplastic mole, am I going to die?

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 What's going to happen here?"

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,000
 And I remember thinking, "I don't even know if I want to know the truth here."

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,400
 And which is crazy that I wouldn't want to know that because at the end of the day, the truth is the only thing that can provide the cure.

49
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,300
 And the reason I tell that story and it ended up being totally diaplastic and totally non-cancerous at all,

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,600
 just to close that loop in case you're going, "What happened?"

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,700
 Is because when it comes to the topic of science and truth and faith,

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,600
 there's this emotional thing inside of Christians at times that feels like, "I don't even want to know the truth.

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,700
 I mean, my professor says this is true.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,500
 It says Christianity is crazy, but I believe the Bible and I believe Jesus.

55
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,700
 And so I don't even want to know.

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,300
 I mean, blessed are the naive is one of the parables, right?

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,600
 And so it's not in there, but ignorance is bliss.

58
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 I just want to hold on to my faith blindly.

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:58,300
 And the reason that's a tragedy is because truth is never something we as followers of Christ have to be afraid of.

60
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,800
 Science can't disprove God.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 God created science.

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,800
 Science is the study of the world around us in an exploration of how God did it.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,100
 The science can't disprove God any more than studying the ingredients of a cake to disprove a cook.

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,200
 And yet all through growing up and really all in the education system around us,

65
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,800
 you and I are fed this idea that God has been removed and evolution and science have proved that God is not there.

66
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
 We don't need him anymore.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:37,900
 And it's just not the case as we're going to explore tonight based on the scientific findings.

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,300
 And you may have never heard that.

69
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,600
 And for years, Christians have been bullied in the education public square.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,000
 Hitler said, if you can control textbooks, you can control a nation.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And it has been happening for years and God is not afraid of truth.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,800
 He's not afraid of science and we don't have to be afraid of science.

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,500
 He doesn't need to be defended.

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,300
 He is no more in need of a defense than a lion who is caged needs to be defended.

75
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,900
 Just unlock the cage.

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:19,800
 And so tonight we're going to explore what I think are the three critical arenas or big questions that science and Christianity seek to answer and how they are not in contradiction.

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:31,100
 In other words, what Christianity tells us about the world around us, about creation, about you and me and about purpose are not inconsistent with the discoveries of science around us.

78
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,000
 And you may never have heard this before.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
 And so we're going to explore these three big topics.

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,800
 So tonight we're going to talk about how did everything begin?

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
 So creation beginning, what does science say about that?

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
 What does the Bible say?

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
 And are they in contradiction?

84
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
 How did we get here?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,200
 Where did we humans come from life?

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
 Where did it all come from?

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
 And what is science told us and telling us?

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,700
 What is the evidence present?

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,900
 And what is the Bible tell us?

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,500
 And are they contradictory?

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,600
 And then what is our purpose?

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,400
 What is science tell us about our purpose?

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
 And what does the Bible tell us about our purpose?

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
 So we're going to start with where did it all begin?

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
 How did the universe begin?

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
 Where did it all come from?

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
 Here's what we know about the universe.

98
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
 All scientists.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,000
 It's a universal belief now that the universe had a beginning.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,800
 The Big Bang was a theory that was proven around the 70s and 80s and it was proposed by this priest.

101
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,400
 You may not know that you may think, hey, the Big Bang is anti-Christian.

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,500
 It was proposed by a priest who came up with the idea, scientifically tested.

103
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
 And here's why the Big Bang is significant.

104
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,700
 It tells us the universe had a beginning.

105
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,200
 Not the TV show Big Bang.

106
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,700
 The Big Bang theory.

107
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,400
 It tells us there was something that began.

108
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,600
 Here's what Stephen Hawking, who's not a believer, says.

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,600
 Virtually everyone, he's a Cambridge, Oxford, very well-known scientist and respected scientist.

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,700
 Virtually everyone believes the universe had a beginning.

111
00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:00,300
 Many people do not like the idea that time has had a beginning, probably because it smacks of divine intervention.

112
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,600
 Here's why that was such a huge, the discovery and the proven theory.

113
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,500
 It was proved of the Big Bang was so big for Christians.

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,800
 Because it proved the universe was not eternal.

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,100
 There was a beginning.

116
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,400
 Which implied, according to Hawking's, there must have been a beginner.

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,600
 That there must have been something that created the explosion.

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,300
 That created the world that we see around us.

119
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,000
 And you can try to explain it all away.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,500
 But even, I mean, when you look at what atheists who believe the Big Bang, because it's almost universally accepted.

121
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:47,100
 What atheists will try to do to attempt to explain the Big Bang without a God behind it.

122
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,400
 It just seems silly.

123
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,200
 Richard Dawkins, who you may have heard of, who's like the big-time atheist, the prophet of atheism.

124
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,800
 When pinned into a corner and asked, "What do you think it could have been?"

125
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:09,500
 He said, "I think it may have been aliens from another universe that came and impregnated our universe with a seed that exploded into the world around us."

126
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 Now, I'm not the smartest guy in the room and I'm a simple man.

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:21,900
 But the fact that a man who is constantly beruging Christians and saying, "You crazy faith people."

128
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:30,600
 "The amount of faith it takes to believe that aliens who show no traces of existence showed up and somehow impregnated our universe."

129
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,500
 I'm not even sure what that means.

130
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 "And created it."

131
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,100
 Seems like an extraordinary leap of faith.

132
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,000
 And this is not just any atheist.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,700
 This is the leading scientific atheist.

134
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,400
 Who says, "Hey, look, it doesn't have to be God. It could have been the aliens. We can't find them, but it could have been them."

135
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,300
 And virtually all across the board, science is pointing to the idea that if there was a beginning, there's implied, there must have been a beginner.

136
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,000
 That's not only what science has recently discovered.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,100
 This came from a book by MIT, professors of astrology and biophysics on the creation and beginning of the world.

138
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,700
 It's a book called, "The First Three Minutes."

139
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,900
 You can look it up afterwards.

140
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:18,900
 Basically, what they discovered is that not only did the universe had a beginning, but the very first thing that we saw or that happened was this explosion of light and energy.

141
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,400
 Now, what does that sound like?

142
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,700
 I mean, that's not at all contradictory.

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,400
 In fact, let's look at what the Christian understanding of the beginning is.

144
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,300
 Genesis 1.

145
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,900
 "In the beginning,"

146
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,200
 "a beginning,"

147
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
 "God created the heavens and the earth."

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,500
 "And the earth was without form and void."

149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,500
 "And darkness was over the face of the deep."

150
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,600
 "And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."

151
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,300
 "And the very first thing He creates in the beginning,"

152
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,800
 Verse 3, "and He said, 'Let there be light.'"

153
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
 And there was light.

154
00:09:51,400 --> 00:10:00,700
 That science, when it comes to the question of a beginning and how did this all begin, lines up exactly with what we would expect to find in Scripture.

155
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,800
 That there was a beginning.

156
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:12,700
 And not only that, that at the beginning there was an explosion of energy and light according to MIT professors and the God of the Bible.

157
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:24,000
 Not only that, we're also discovering that there's this order in the universe around us that was created a part of it that lines up really well with Colossians 1, 16 and 17.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
 We're talking about Jesus.

159
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,100
 In Him, all things were created.

160
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
 So it wasn't just light and exploded.

161
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,800
 That God, in Jesus, all things were created.

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,700
 Things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers, and all things have been created through Him and for Him.

163
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,800
 He is before all things and in Him all things hold together.

164
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 That Jesus is holding the unchanging God, the universe together in a way that gives it order.

165
00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:01,500
 That gravity is not changing here today and tomorrow, but it is being held by God together and gives us the laws of nature around us.

166
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:11,400
 I mean, the very idea, my team and I were discussing earlier today, people think even the Big Bang is like, well, you either believe in God or the Big Bang.

167
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,000
 The Big Bang was an explanation by a priest about how a big God created a big universe around us.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
 It had never been an atheistic belief.

169
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,600
 And it's been stolen and taken maybe by the TV show or who knows.

170
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 But that belief was never introduced to Trump.

171
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 God, it doesn't.

172
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 It just says the universe had a beginning and points to Him.

173
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:40,400
 There is no contradiction when it comes to creation, a beginning, and what science says and what the Bible says.

174
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,900
 Here's what the leading professor of geophysics at Yale says.

175
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,100
 He was the leading scientist for NASA for years.

176
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:58,500
 He says this, "For the scientists in light of these discoveries about the world and it being exploded and light being a part of it," he says this,

177
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:08,300
 "For the scientist who has lived by faith in the power of reason," and he's not a believer or Christian, "the story ends like a bad dream.

178
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,600
 He has scaled the mountain of ignorance.

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
 He's about to conquer the highest peak.

180
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:24,200
 And as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries saying, 'In the beginning, God created,'"

181
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,100
 and he said, "Let there be light," and there was, "and let there be life," and there was.

182
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,000
 And there was no contradiction.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,200
 And if you search out the evidence, that's what you will discover.

184
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:50,800
 It may not have been what your professor or eighth grade history teacher who's there to coach football really told you, but it's what's out there.

185
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
 So the second idea of where did we come from?

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,900
 Okay, so maybe creation and that is actually lining up with what the Bible says according to intellectuals across the board in all scientific arenas.

187
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
 What about where we came from?

188
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,800
 We came from monkeys, right?

189
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,400
 And there was like this pool of energy and it kind of evolved into everything that we see around us.

190
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,200
 I mean, maybe you saw this tree image growing up like I was introduced to, the evolutionary tree.

191
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,700
 Well, yeah, at the beginning, there was a protist.

192
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,900
 We're not even really sure what those are, but they were in the beginning.

193
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:29,600
 And then sometime after, mollusks came and brachiopods and everything that we see.

194
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 Great-grandfather was a brachiopod.

195
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,900
 And this is, I mean, I was taught that this is just proven fact.

196
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,600
 And that's not the case.

197
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,400
 And what I'm about to tell you, if you are skeptical, you're going to think, oh, great.

198
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,300
 The crazy church Baptist people are trying to tell us it's not the case.

199
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,200
 I'm about to give you some information that comes from the leading paleontologist at Harvard University.

200
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:03,800
 That may seem really heady, but the reason we're going to go there is because the leading scientists in paleontology, which is the study of like fossils and those things,

201
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,800
 are all coming and saying, we're still looking for the links.

202
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,300
 And the greatest hoax that has been produced by great con men is that evolution is a fact.

203
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:29,700
 And what I mean by evolution is not micro evolution or the adaptation, minor adaptations of a species, like a bird getting longer wings, but a bird becoming a dog somewhere along the tree.

204
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,600
 So funny to people, hurt a lot of scientists feelings right now is what you just did.

205
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:45,200
 So here's what he says as it relates to the problem that we still can't find 150 years after Darwin.

206
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,900
 We landed men on the moon.

207
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,200
 We got iPhones created.

208
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
 We're doing incredible things.

209
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,300
 We're digging everywhere we can.

210
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,100
 And despite all of our advancements in life and technology, we still can't find them.

211
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
 Like maybe they're not there.

212
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,000
 Here's what he says.

213
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,000
 The extreme rarity, this is the head.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 He's an agnostic and the head of the paleontology department at Harvard.

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,700
 The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology.

216
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,700
 As though the paleontologists know we can't find them.

217
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,600
 The evolutionary trees.

218
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,500
 This is the Harvard head of paleontology.

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,700
 The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks, much like the one we just saw, have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches.

220
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,800
 The rest is inference.

221
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,900
 However reasonable, not the evidence of fossils.

222
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:47,100
 Darwin wagered his entire theory on the denial of this literal record that he thought it would be there.

223
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,200
 We'd eventually find it.

224
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 Darwin's argument persists today as the favored escape of most paleontologists from the embarrassment of a record that shows little of evolution directly.

225
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:09,200
 Paleontologists, him being one, have paid an exorbitant price for Darwin's argument to keep it alive.

226
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,000
 What's he saying?

227
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 He's saying the evidence is not there.

228
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:19,400
 This idea of the evolution taking place and what we believe that we would eventually find, we just can't seem to find.

229
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,200
 In fact, this is going to be really complicated.

230
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,500
 I'm going to try to make it as clear as I can.

231
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:31,900
 What science is discovering in life and geology and the fossil record is that there was this explosion of life.

232
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,500
 You may have heard of it called the Cambrian explosion.

233
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,200
 And in that explosion, they would expect, they saw all these different life forms.

234
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:47,200
 When they dug up, oh my gosh, all these different life forms and fossils, we would expect that underneath them would be their ancestors.

235
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
 But they weren't underneath them.

236
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,700
 We couldn't find fossils underneath them.

237
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,900
 And they came up with another theory.

238
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,600
 They must have just disintegrated.

239
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,200
 That must be what happened.

240
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 Or they never existed.

241
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:12,800
 The evidence we have today does nothing to contradict how you and I got here, despite what you may have heard.

242
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,700
 And go search it out if you don't believe me.

243
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:21,100
 Christians give us this explanation.

244
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,500
 Genesis 1, 26 and 27.

245
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,200
 Then God said, let us make man in our own image after our likeness.

246
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,100
 So the Trinity very early on.

247
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:40,300
 And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and over all livestock and over all the earth and every creeping thing.

248
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,500
 So God created man in his image and the image of God.

249
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 He created the male and female.

250
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,400
 That what God said is I created distinct humans or distinctly humans apart from everything else in creation.

251
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:07,000
 That what humans will be for the next thousands of years that they're around is they will be the ones who rule over the fish of the sea, the land and everything else that we see in creation because they are made distinctly in my image, unlike nothing else in the world around us.

252
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,300
 And that's very evident.

253
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:19,500
 In what we see around us that we're not competing with like the monkeys who keep getting out of line and we got to back them into the wherever they are kept.

254
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,500
 We're not competing with any other species that man is unique among all creation.

255
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,200
 God says.

256
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:34,000
 Has been made in his image in the scientific record and you have been fed so much in schools and in lies.

257
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,500
 Is just not there.

258
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:48,100
 And if you do your research, you will see what the head of institutions well respected like Harvard, Yale, Cambridge, Oxford are saying this is the best kept secret out there.

259
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,700
 They just don't exist.

260
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,900
 And God.

261
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,200
 Want you to know.

262
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:08,100
 We have been praying for that all week.

263
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,600
 I'm kidding.

264
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,300
 I'm totally kidding.

265
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,900
 It's just someone with a bowling ball rolling around.

266
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,000
 And it's raining outside.

267
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,500
 But the evidence again, it brings no conflict.

268
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 Let's close in prayer.

269
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,300
 But there.

270
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,500
 How do we recover?

271
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,800
 Here is the last thing I'll say on this point.

272
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,600
 The evidence, the actual evidence is in no way conflicting with what the Bible tells us.

273
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,200
 It doesn't tell us the full extent of everything.

274
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,500
 It does say that God breathed life into man and made him unique with a soul.

275
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,200
 The ability to rule the ability to understand good and evil or morality.

276
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,300
 This inner sense Romans 2 tells us that God put in every heart.

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,100
 And the scientific evidence that is out there doesn't conflict with what we see in Genesis and in the Bible.

278
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,700
 There is no conflict.

279
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:35,400
 There is a conflict with this agenda that is going out in our culture that is trying to silence the voices of anyone who would suggest intelligent design.

280
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,700
 Last night I watched this movie and it was kind of like movie night for my wife and I.

281
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,500
 And we, I knew I was going to teach on this today.

282
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,400
 And so we were going to watch the movie Expelled.

283
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,200
 And man, it is really coming down out there.

284
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,900
 We're going to watch this movie Expelled.

285
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,000
 And if you haven't heard of Expelled, it's like this documentary on science and intelligent design.

286
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,600
 And how intelligent design is being suppressed in major universities all over our country.

287
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,800
 And so Ben Stein, who's not a Christian, goes around interviewing men and women who've lost their jobs.

288
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,200
 Because, and they in the interview say, I'm not even saying intelligent design is correct.

289
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,300
 I'm just saying the evidence points to something more than just evolution.

290
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:32,500
 And this agenda is taking place all over our country where if you are a professor, you cannot get tenure in many major universities if you do not believe that evolution alone is king.

291
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 Or if you believe in intelligent design or teach it.

292
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:51,100
 Last week, you may have heard about this, in the University of California, a paleontologist who is a professor at the University of California was fired because his discovery of a triceratops, which is just a dinosaur, had soft tissue on it.

293
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,000
 There was soft tissue on what he had found.

294
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,300
 And he suggested, this is one of the more amazing discoveries we've ever found.

295
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,800
 This means it can't be older than 4,000 years, he suggested.

296
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,700
 Which you may agree with, may not, who knows.

297
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,300
 But the fact that he would even suggest such a thing, they fired him immediately.

298
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,200
 Because it didn't fit in to their agenda.

299
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:21,800
 And the only conflict in the world around us is from a group that is trying to silence the idea that there might be something more.

300
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,100
 And present Christianity as a crutch, and it is no crutch.

301
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,400
 It is a cure for a world that is dying and needs it.

302
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:48,300
 And it is the story, invitation, and explanation of the God who is, who created all that we see, who became a man and died for us, came back to life, holds all life together, and offers new life for anyone who will accept it.

303
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,900
 It is no crutch, but it is a cure.

304
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,400
 And that's being silenced.

305
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:02,800
 The third question that Christianity and science attempt to answer is just this, what is our purpose?

306
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,500
 And even here we have no conflict between science and Christianity.

307
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,400
 Because science as a worldview, an all encompassing worldview, says there is no purpose.

308
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,500
 You don't have one.

309
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,700
 Might as well just put a shotgun in your mouth and end it all.

310
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,100
 There's nothing to live for.

311
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 Human race can just try to keep living, but there's no purpose around us.

312
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,000
 And it can't even begin to explain why there's this inner sense of something that's, there's got to be more.

313
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,300
 I know everything happens for a reason.

314
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:44,400
 In fact, not only can it not explain purpose, it can't explain so many undeniable realities that we all seem to feel.

315
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
 It can't explain why we think there's something as beauty.

316
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,600
 Like you can't measure it in a test tube and it can't explain this feeling you get in front of the Grand Canyon or the ocean.

317
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,500
 Or when you look at the night sky.

318
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,100
 It can't explain this idea of like even love or connection between two humans.

319
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,500
 It can't explain emotions.

320
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:18,600
 I mean, how could men who weep come from inanimate organisms who feel nothing?

321
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,900
 It can't explain morality.

322
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:30,700
 I mean, this has been the linchpin for so many intellectual Christians is the subject of morality without God.

323
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:38,800
 Because the problem of good and evil is a much bigger problem for a world without God than a world with him.

324
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 Because in a world without God, there is no such thing as good and evil.

325
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 There is no absolute truth.

326
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,300
 But there's something inside of me that thinks genocide is wrong.

327
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
 Rape is evil.

328
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,800
 Those emotions don't exist in the animal kingdom.

329
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,300
 A primate that takes another primate back to mate with her.

330
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,300
 There's no emotional discontent from the others in his tribe or whatever he's a part of.

331
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:20,300
 In a world without God or science being all-encompassing can't explain even why there's this sense of good and evil apart from God.

332
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,300
 It can't even explain like little things, like silly things.

333
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,800
 It can't, you know, like yawning.

334
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,300
 They still can't figure out why we yawn.

335
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,800
 Nothing shows the limits of science.

336
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,300
 The fact that we, and you may have heard, oh yeah, it's because the brain needs oxygen.

337
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,300
 Nope, that's not even the leading theory about why.

338
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 Look it up.

339
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:45,300
 I mean, here's like a crazy thing about science and the data and how it's just often, sometimes off.

340
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,300
 Did you know it's a scientific impossibility to hit a 90 mile an hour fastball?

341
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,300
 And God loves baseball.

342
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 It's a scientific, and you're going, no, no, no, I see it all the time.

343
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
 Look it up.

344
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:06,300
 Yale physics in the last few years produced a report that said it's physically impossible based on the amount of time that you would have for the ball to reach home

345
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:14,300
 and for you to decide whether or not you want to hit it, for someone to hit a 90 mile an hour fastball, it is scientifically impossible.

346
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
 And it's an undeniable reality.

347
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 And no one would go, I'm going with science on this one.

348
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,300
 I don't think we can explain that one.

349
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
 Nope, can't be possible.

350
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,300
 There's things everywhere you look.

351
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,300
 But Christianity can answer the question of purpose.

352
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,300
 To know that you were created, and this is going to be really big, I'm going to try to really explain this.

353
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,300
 To know God.

354
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
 You.

355
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,300
 In other words, to have knowledge of God.

356
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,300
 And here's why that's so important and why science is not a threat, but our friend.

357
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:54,300
 Because science, real science, introduces us to the creator.

358
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
 I mean, think about it.

359
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,300
 Astrology. Astrology studies the stars of the God who hung them in place.

360
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,300
 Geology studies the God who breathed life into creation.

361
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 And when we look closer into creation, we see the handprints of the divine everywhere that we look.

362
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 Geology studies the world around us, the rocks, the formations of the earth that he created in an explosion.

363
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
 In an instant.

364
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:28,300
 And science allows us to know the creator behind it.

365
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
 And knowledge and science are our friend.

366
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
 And your purpose is to know him.

367
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
 Make him known.

368
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,300
 Christianity can also answer the questions of beauty.

369
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:48,300
 Because you and I were designed and created by a God who loves beauty, is beauty, creates beauty, of love.

370
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,300
 It answers the question of the sense of love.

371
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
 And why we feel that?

372
00:27:53,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 Because we're made in the image of a loving God who perfectly displayed that love on a cross.

373
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
 It answers the question of morality.

374
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:08,300
 Of a God who put and wired into men who were made in his image.

375
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:14,300
 You cannot, if you were made in my image, escape this sense of right and wrong.

376
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:25,300
 Christianity is not afraid of the truth, it offers the truth to a world that is leaning on a crutch of science that is pointing back to a creator.

377
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,300
 And we don't have anything to be afraid of.

378
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
 And anything to fear.

379
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:38,300
 And tonight, really like this whole series, we want you, if you're a follower of Jesus, we just want you to know you're not crazy.

380
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 Do the research.

381
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,300
 You don't have anything to be afraid of when it comes to science.

382
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,300
 All science is God's science, created by him.

383
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,300
 And if you're skeptical, you have everything to be afraid of.

384
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
 And you can't be too careful.

385
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:03,300
 Because every day, leading scientists are saying, "Evolution as a worldview is bankrupt."

386
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,300
 And I put my whole life on it, and it's bankrupt.

387
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:16,300
 And you can't be too careful, because everywhere you look, you see the hand and fingerprints of a divine creator who made the world around you.

388
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,300
 So you have everything to fear, and nothing to hope in.

389
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,300
 And you have way more faith than you realize, if you don't believe there's a God.

390
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:38,300
 You may think, and I think part of me at times wonders, "Yeah, but what are those clues? Where are the fingerprints that we can see them?"

391
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:45,300
 And I wish we could go on and on into different arenas, but I want to show you just one that won't prove inconclusively anything.

392
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:55,300
 But it does display a powerful display of a God who loves you, wants to know you, and gave his life for you.

393
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,300
 I first heard another pastor actually talk about this subject.

394
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:13,300
 And he said, he was telling a story basically, and he said, "I had just given a message, and it was on how big God is, and just the greatness of God, and how large the God of the universe is."

395
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,300
 The pastor was telling the story, he says, "I just gave that."

396
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,300
 And after the talk, this molecular biologist comes up, and I'm like, "Oh no, great, fact check."

397
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:31,300
 And so the guy comes up, and he begins to say, "Hey, great message, but I know that your next message is going to be on just the greatness of God in the human body."

398
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,300
 And he says, "I want to tell you something and show you something."

399
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 And he begins to explain, "I want to tell you about laminin."

400
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,300
 And he says, "You have to tell your people about laminin."

401
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,300
 And laminin, what you are feeling right now is probably what he felt, and I know what I felt when I just heard, "Yeah, what's laminin?"

402
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:59,300
 Laminin, inside of the human body, and really all animals and living, anything that breathes, there's something called laminin.

403
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:06,300
 And laminin is the cell adhesion molecule, this is going to be really molecular and biological.

404
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,300
 It's the thing that holds all your cells together.

405
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,300
 Inside of your body, there's thousands and thousands and thousands of cells.

406
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:22,300
 We can't even count, we don't know how many that there are, and they're all held together by this one molecule called laminin.

407
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:31,300
 He said, "It's like the rebar of the human body, like the bars that you put in when you put cement on a foundation of a house, it's the thing that holds it all together.

408
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:37,300
 It's holding your skin right now together. It's holding your insides together. It's laminin."

409
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:44,300
 And what you're feeling is what I was feeling when I first heard it, because I was going, "Yeah, so what is the big deal?"

410
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,300
 And he said, "No, no, no, it's the thing that's holding you together."

411
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,300
 And he said, "You've got to see a picture of it."

412
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,300
 And here was the picture.

413
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:13,300
 That the very molecule that's holding you together right now, in all of your cells, in everything, and that's not from like, oh, Christianity.org, that is from the National Academy of Sciences.

414
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:25,300
 What's holding you together is a molecule in the same shape of the instrument that God, who came to earth, died on for you and for me.

415
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
 I mean, that's crazy.

416
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,300
 I mean, here's a microscopic image of what it looks like inside of your body.

417
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:45,300
 Inside of your body, there's thousands of these. Everything that you are is being held together by a symbol that billions in the world recognize to reflect the love of a God who created.

418
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:51,300
 And yeah, you can clap all you want. That is unbelievable.

419
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
 And you may go, "Oh, but that didn't really prove anything."

420
00:32:53,300 --> 00:33:02,300
 Here's all that I'm saying. His invisible attributes and divine nature are clearly seen in the world around us.

421
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:10,300
 And you can go with the alien idea and have no sense of purpose or life.

422
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:18,300
 Or you can embrace the reality of a God who loves you and has made himself known in all creation around us.

423
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,300
 I'm going to pray and we'll close out.

424
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:31,300
 Father, we thank you that you have left signatures of yourself everywhere that we look.

425
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:39,300
 And that you are not only the one who created all things, as we read earlier, and hold all things together.

426
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:47,300
 And everything is for you. And even the cells in our body seem to tell the story of a God who loves us.

427
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,300
 I pray for my friends in the room who don't know that, that they would.

428
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,300
 That you would make yourself revealed to them.

429
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:00,300
 We thank you for the rain and just even the humbling that comes from the roar of thunder.

430
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,300
 And the power of a God who sits behind it all.

431
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
 We love you. Thank you most of all for Jesus.

432
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
 Amen.

433
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:18,300
