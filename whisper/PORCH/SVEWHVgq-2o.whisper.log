[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:20.760]   - Well, good evening here in Dallas
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.220]   and to friends back in Fort Worth
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.600]   where I spend most Tuesday nights,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.920]   Houston and around the country.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.200]   Dialed In for Amnesia Part Two, we are back.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.140]   And I wanna start with a story.
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.040]   Every once in a while, you find $36 flights to Boulder.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.680]   And when you do that, 100% of the time, you buy 'em.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.760]   So a group of friends and I just went,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.000]   seven of us to be exact, went to Boulder
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.440]   and spent a day there, climbed a mountain.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.520]   And while we were there, a protest broke out in the street
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.440]   in kind of the downtown-ish area of Boulder.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.280]   Now, I don't know if you know,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.880]   but there was a new president elected.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.120]   This was November 12th, the day we were there.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.500]   The election was just a few days removed
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.880]   and some people were upset about that.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.480]   And so they gathered, congregated.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.560]   There was an all-out protest.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.880]   And so just to give you kind of a picture
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.340]   of what's going on, I think 75 to 100 people,
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.040]   shouting, banners, you know, the whole deal,
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.120]   love trumps hate, everything you can imagine.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.200]   Anti-governmental system, pretty aggressive chants.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.520]   It wasn't anarchy, let's just call it messy, all right?
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.700]   And so I started to look around
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.840]   and most of the folks who were participating in this
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.080]   just appeared and proudly,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.980]   they wouldn't be upset with me giving them this description.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.280]   They appeared to be living an alternative lifestyle
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.680]   and they waved that banner quite proudly.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.700]   And so that's what they were about.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.760]   And so as the protest was going on,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.240]   I thought, you know, when a protest happens,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.080]   there's like a group of people that congregate
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   and then there's a whole separate group of people
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.960]   around them that congregate and kind of watch.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.560]   We were in that second group.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.220]   And I thought, you know, I'm kind of good on politics.
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.520]   I don't feel any need to get into that discussion today.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.660]   But what I would love to do is maybe we can share the hope
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.320]   and love of Christ, you know, and maybe we can do that.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.640]   And so what happened is he finishes the protest.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.800]   He's leading the chants and, you know,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.460]   he's yelling into the megaphone.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.320]   And as soon as he finishes, he calls the next meeting,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.240]   puts the megaphone down.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.340]   And as soon as he does, well, some friends and I
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.700]   that were with us that day, we went up
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.780]   and we wanted to approach him.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.860]   And we did that pretty quickly.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.500]   And so again, if you want to get a really clear picture,
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.100]   like not well-kept, not well-groomed,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.620]   like totally, like they're averaging
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.660]   about two showers a week.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.480]   I'm giving you total honesty.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.640]   And so I approached these guys
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.800]   to get into a discussion with them.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860]   And it looks like the Brady bunch is going to talk to him
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.860]   'cause we're not dressed like them.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.820]   We don't look like them.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.820]   And so everybody all of a sudden is kind of intrigued,
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.680]   like, oh, we're about to have a discussion here.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.140]   And so then they gather around again.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.320]   And so now we just want to have a little discussion
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.660]   where we get a chance to share the hope and love of Christ
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.740]   over any political system with our friends.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.980]   And so we're in this conversation.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.700]   And if one thing happened in that conversation,
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.620]   that's the reason I start with this story.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.660]   There was a girl who interrupted the conversation
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.700]   pretty angrily, accused me of anger,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.040]   but in her anger, in her angry accusation,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.420]   she asked me a question.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.420]   It was like a moment came where she was going to put down
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.980]   her anger and she was going to be polite.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.980]   And like the manners like kicked in.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.140]   And when that happened, she chose a sentence
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.820]   that no one has ever said to me before out of manners.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.260]   She said this sentence and I'm being totally serious.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.460]   She was totally sincere.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.420]   She didn't say it for a laugh.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.260]   She didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.100]   She was being kind.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.960]   She said, "Do you identify as a white male?"
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.060]   That's what she said.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.020]   And it wasn't like, you know,
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.940]   that's not how we introduce ourselves in Fort Worth, okay?
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.540]   And so I'm like, if you do,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.780]   then you would be considered rude
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.820]   or you'd be making fun of somebody
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.020]   or maybe making a bad joke.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.380]   And like, ooh, that's kind of insensitive.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.140]   And so it would just be misunderstood.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.020]   But she was being completely sincere,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.940]   totally kindhearted even.
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.860]   This was her way of showing love and care and acceptance
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.720]   was just to ask me, do I identify as a white male?
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.980]   Which she politely also asked the guy
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.420]   that we were talking to.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.700]   And so he answered yes, I answered yes.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.580]   And the conversation went on.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.040]   We did get a chance to share with them explicitly
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.780]   the hope and faith that we have in Christ.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.340]   And both groups kind of parted high-fiving
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.660]   because they got to talk about what they wanted
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.800]   to talk about, which was politics.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.460]   And we got to talk about what we wanted to talk about,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.300]   which was Christ.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.120]   And so everybody left happy.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.180]   But there was that one sentence that stuck with me.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.700]   And I realized she was so sincere.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.300]   If I had told her, like, I feel five-five
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.900]   instead of six feet tall, she would have been,
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.740]   she'd be like, okay.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.060]   She probably would have started looking right here.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.900]   I mean, she was going to totally buy in.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.620]   And so if I had told her that I was Asian,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.020]   she would have totally played by those rules.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.500]   If I had told her I felt like a woman,
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.860]   she would have called me ma'am out of respect,
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.300]   like not even to be funny.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.500]   This is not a game to her.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.040]   She is so serious and so sincere.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   And I realized this is not just a protester
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.760]   versus pastor conversation.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.520]   This is an every person conversation.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.980]   This is a me, personally conversation.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.240]   Because what she said was, she used the word identify.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.880]   But she could have used the word feel interchangeably.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.800]   And so for her, catch this, don't miss this,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.840]   or you'll miss us from the start if you miss this.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   She was saying that your feelings are your identity.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   The way you feel is who you are.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.940]   So if you want to find out who you are,
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.900]   just look inside yourself, find where your feelings are,
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.760]   follow your feelings, and we'll just call that your identity.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.040]   Your feelings decide your identity.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.520]   She had wholeheartedly bought into that,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.420]   and she was going to extend me the same privilege.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.460]   And so she was fully convinced that to commit,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.180]   or rather to commit to your feelings,
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.060]   is to find your identity.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.140]   That's where she was.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.660]   And I realized, man, this is not just something
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.020]   I should shake my head at.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.340]   And this conversation this evening
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.940]   is not about what's going on in society
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.060]   in some other part of the country.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.100]   I realized this is a me conversation.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.820]   Because there has been a time in my life,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.220]   and I realize much more often than I think,
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.020]   that my feelings and my identity actually don't agree.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.880]   Not about gender, not necessarily about race.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.640]   But I think back to the time I became a Christian.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.180]   See, before I was a believer in Christ,
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.740]   before I was a follower of Jesus,
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.860]   I did whatever I felt like.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.420]   If I felt like having sex, that's what I would do.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.700]   If I felt like looking at pornography,
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.620]   that's what I would do.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.420]   If I felt like running from the police,
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.620]   that's what I would do, and did, twice.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.500]   Dad, I've never actually told you that, but that happened.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.340]   And so,
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.660]   so whenever you are following a feeling,
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.280]   before you're a Christ follower, that's just who you are.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.260]   So my feelings and my identity were exactly the same.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.440]   I was the guy who did what I felt like.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.920]   Feelings and identity were exactly the same.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.220]   But then I became a Christian, in a moment.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.460]   And my identity changed.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.220]   Now, you heard David talk about that a little bit last week
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.580]   in Amnesia Part One.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.220]   The old was gone and the new had come.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.660]   And so my identity changed in a split second.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.140]   What happened to my feelings was exactly nothing.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.980]   I still felt like doing everything that I had done before.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.060]   I was now a Christian who had an identity in Christ.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.900]   I'd been given this brand new identity, slate clean,
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.660]   but the only problem was I still felt like looking at porn,
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.540]   having sex, running from the police,
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.060]   and just generally partying.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.140]   And I was about to go to college.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.820]   But this identity versus feelings clash.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.620]   And so the question for us all tonight
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.220]   is not whether feelings are powerful.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.480]   Can we agree feelings are powerful?
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   Hurts, pains, doubts, wants, desires, hopes, dreams,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.100]   all these are incredibly powerful.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.340]   Families start because somebody gets a feeling.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.820]   Actually, because two people get a feeling.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.660]   That's why you're here.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.060]   Two people got a feeling.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.460]   So feelings are powerful things.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.500]   Families break apart because somebody gets a feeling.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.420]   Some of you move cities because you got a feeling.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.100]   Some of you are here right now for some reason
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.660]   that you just decided that you had a feeling
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.740]   you should come.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.780]   Feelings are incredibly powerful things.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.580]   The question is, the question for tonight is,
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.780]   which one should we commit to?
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.320]   Should we, as my friend from Boulder
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.180]   would politely encourage me,
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.380]   should we commit to our feelings and say,
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.780]   you know what, that's gonna be who I am.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.900]   I'm gonna be the person who does what I feel like.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.540]   When I do what I feel like, I'll find out who I am.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.940]   Or should we, what if I told you
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.940]   that finding your identity
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.060]   was not a matter of following your feelings,
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.300]   but it was actually a matter of resisting them,
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.700]   sometimes for a long time,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.700]   sometimes with much difficulty.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.520]   And you don't have to tell me that feelings are difficult.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.280]   I have had addictions.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.120]   I get it.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.420]   Feelings are powerful.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.540]   And I know some of you, even tonight,
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.880]   you're here and you've got a feeling
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.240]   that you wish you didn't have.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.100]   You're like, I wish this feeling wasn't here.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.940]   In fact, I've asked God to take it away.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.420]   I wish that I didn't feel this way.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.540]   And here you are, you're at the porch,
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.020]   and you're like, maybe the momentum of the porch,
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.060]   maybe somebody can sing it out or preach it out.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.180]   We'll just porch it out.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.900]   Like for some reason, you think this feeling could go away
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.020]   and you're sitting there hopeful, hopeful, hopeful
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.780]   that a feeling would disappear.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.780]   And there it is.
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.220]   That's the power of a feeling.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.040]   So we can all agree that feelings are powerful.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.820]   And we can agree that feelings and identity
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.880]   can sometimes clash.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.440]   That's just common human experience.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.340]   The question for tonight is, which is a little less clear,
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.620]   which one should we commit to?
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.220]   Should we commit to our feelings and say,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.240]   that's who we'll be, or should we commit to who we'll be?
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   And then sometimes, with much pain, filter our feelings.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.140]   That's the question for tonight.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.180]   And so what I wanna do tonight is I'd love to introduce you
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.340]   to a man in the Bible that you might not have met before.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.740]   He is in Genesis chapter 25, and his name is Esau.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.700]   Esau is a man with a big identity from God,
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.460]   a huge identity from God, in fact,
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.880]   much greater than he even knew at the time.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.440]   But the man with the big identity
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.740]   got a little feeling one day.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.620]   And so I wanna show you as best I can
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.460]   from Genesis chapter 25, the way feelings and identity
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.660]   interact and which ones we should embrace
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.580]   and which one we should be prepared to resist.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.060]   Now Esau, I said Esau was given an identity from God.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.780]   You're gonna wanna understand this piece
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.140]   because it's what brings attention
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.040]   and interest to the story.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.340]   So Esau had a big identity
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.060]   because he had something called a birthright.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.560]   Now we don't do birthrights anymore.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.660]   And so you wanna know what that is.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.860]   A birthright consists of three things.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.000]   One, when dad died, you got to be the ruler of the family.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.220]   And so when dad died, it didn't turn into a democracy
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.260]   when dad died, you were the boss, okay?
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.400]   You were in control whenever dad died.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.180]   So that's one thing, you had the right to rule.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.340]   Secondly, you got a double portion of the inheritance.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.780]   And so you were literally twice as rich
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.740]   as your brothers and sisters, so that's not a bad deal.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.900]   And so if you had the birthright,
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.220]   you literally would receive twice the inheritance.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.380]   And thirdly, and most importantly by far,
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.440]   if you had the birthright,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.460]   let's say if you had the identity of the firstborn son
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.280]   who always got the birthright, firstborn son always.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.880]   If you were given the identity of the birthright,
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.940]   you had a sense of blessing from God,
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.140]   a sense that God was with you,
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.260]   a sense that God was in your corner.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.040]   It's kind of mystical, it's kind of hard to know,
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.780]   but in some ways that you wouldn't even understand
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.520]   as your life unfolded, if you had the birthright,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.420]   you weren't just guaranteed the right to rule
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.680]   on a double portion of the inheritance,
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.100]   you were guaranteed that God was with you in a special way.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.820]   Esau was a twin, but he beat his brother out of the womb
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.780]   by just a few minutes, okay?
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.220]   And so on the birthright deal, it's not like,
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.580]   oh, close, we'll have to split it up.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.240]   I mean, he won, so he got out of the womb first,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.580]   so he has 100% of the birthright.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.760]   And his twin brother Jacob had zero, but Jacob was smart.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.340]   And so as we'll see, the two boys grew up very differently
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.740]   and you will see, I hope, in a fascinating story,
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.780]   the way identity and feelings played out
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.380]   for this one man in Genesis 25.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.220]   So here we go.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.160]   One day when the twin boys were all grown up,
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.760]   the man with a big identity got a little feeling.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.600]   Verse 27, "When the boys grew up,
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.760]   Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field."
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.560]   It says elsewhere in the scripture that he was hairy.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.060]   I don't know why you include that detail,
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.900]   but that's in there.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.440]   And so I think this guy's living Duck Dynasty cast member.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.060]   Okay, so that's who Esau is.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.560]   Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.520]   while Jacob, the younger twin without the birthright,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.880]   was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.340]   So he's like the inside guy.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.480]   Isaac, that's dad, loved Esau because he ate of his game.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.440]   It's like, duh, he's a daddy's boy, that's easy.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.720]   But Rebecca, that's mama, loved Jacob.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.180]   Okay, so Esau went and killed the food
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.180]   and Jacob did dishes.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.200]   That's the way that worked, okay?
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.240]   So there's a daddy's boy and there's a mama's boy.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.140]   That's the way that works.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.660]   Verse 29, "Once when Jacob was cooking stew,"
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.200]   because that's what he did,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.820]   "Esau came in from the field,"
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.280]   because that's what he did, "and he was exhausted."
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.760]   Now there's your feeling, there's your culprit,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.400]   there's your problem, exhausted.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.840]   Your translation might say famished,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.900]   and he's really hungry.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.000]   So it's some combination.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.520]   So famished, exhausted,
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.680]   we don't really have an English word to translate this,
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.040]   but I'm convinced the best word is hangry.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.640]   This is the first example of hanger in the Bible, okay?
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.380]   So we got some hunger, we got some anger,
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.360]   we got some fatigue, that's where Esau is.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.880]   Now we know, some of you are like,
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.920]   don't elbow anybody next to you,
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.440]   but you know that's a powerful feeling, right?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.400]   It can corrupt your behavior, all right?
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.640]   It can create some problems.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.840]   And so that's where Esau is,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.060]   that's what he is feeling, and he walks in the door.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.520]   "And Esau said to Jacob," this is awfully formal,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.020]   you wouldn't say it this way, but he communicates,
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.480]   "Let me eat some of that red stew,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.980]   "for I am having this feeling, for I am exhausted."
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.960]   Now this is a huge moment for a little brother,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.640]   because older brother actually needs something for a change.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.840]   Any younger brothers in here?
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.780]   Me too, it's tough, isn't it?
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.060]   Older brother never needs you, ever, right?
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.040]   It's like, can I drive your car?
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.180]   No, can I hang out with your friends?
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.880]   No, can we make up a handshake or something?
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.800]   No, I mean, you just can't get anything,
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.520]   like you can't get anything from your older brother.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.640]   And then finally one day,
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.080]   older brother comes in and needs something.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.060]   What a rich moment, right?
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.960]   And if you are a wise little brother,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.400]   you will seize the moment, all right?
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.000]   And Jacob, deceptive and just downright smart,
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.780]   decides to negotiate and he swings for the fence.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.400]   Verse 31, Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   "I'll take that."
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.200]   I'm so glad you laughed,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.780]   because he should have gotten laughed at.
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.780]   That offer should have been just disregarded immediately.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.740]   I mean, this is like, hey, I know what,
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.220]   let's trade your inheritance for a Whataburger.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.540]   That's what just happened.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.100]   And what's sad is some of you right now are like,
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.900]   Whataburger, that's pretty good, ooh.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.980]   He should, I mean, who would do this?
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.140]   Who would trade a birthright?
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.660]   Who would trade, you could say, an identity?
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.780]   Who would trade something like that for a meal?
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.860]   And the answer is somebody with a feeling.
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.340]   Verse 32, Esau said, "I am about to die."
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.620]   I'm so glad he says this out loud.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.460]   What?
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.700]   I'm about to die, what use is a birthright to me?
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.940]   Now that escalated quickly.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.900]   One minute we're hungry,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.700]   and the next minute we're about to die.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.920]   Feelings will turn you into a complete drama queen.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.500]   That's exactly what's happening to him.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.340]   I'm about to die.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.540]   Hey, let me help you, Esau, listen.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.700]   People who are about to die from exhaustion,
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.380]   they don't come inside and announce they're about to die.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.940]   They just stay outside and die.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.460]   But he comes inside and is convinced in his feeling
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.460]   that he is about to die.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.060]   He wants something so bad that he cannot think straight.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:54.960]   You ever thought that?
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.620]   Oh, if I don't have that, I'm gonna die.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.820]   If I don't drink that, I'm gonna die.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.980]   If I don't touch that, I'm gonna die.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.100]   If I don't click on that, I might die.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.740]   Let me help you, you will not die.
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.100]   I've been there and you won't die.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.480]   This is why, this is why JP says,
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.240]   "I trust myself the least when I really want something."
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.280]   This is why our senior leader here, Todd,
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.020]   says feelings may be real, but they are not reliable.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.980]   And Esau's got the wheels turning and he is forgetting.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.540]   This is a bad time to get amnesia about who you are,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.000]   and he is forgetting his identity.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.960]   And he's all set to follow his feelings.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.280]   In verse 33, Jacob said, "Swear to me now."
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.360]   They're about to cut this deal.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.840]   It's about to happen.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.700]   This is the worst thing to watch.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.480]   I can't stand, it's the worst.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.600]   Just to watch this unfold and kind of slow-mo,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.880]   it's like, are you kidding me?
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.040]   Are we really entertaining this?
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.880]   It makes me wish, I don't know about you,
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.240]   but it makes me wish that I could just like
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.240]   interrupt the story.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.360]   And I know that's a little bit like,
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.240]   hey, you don't get to, I know that.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   But I wish that I could have a conversation with him.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.600]   Don't you?
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.640]   I wish that I could talk with him.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.000]   And now listen, I don't know what you would say,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.840]   but here's what I would say.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.900]   I would say, Esau, I know that feeling is really strong,
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.620]   and I know it's growing the more
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.800]   and the more you think about it.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.860]   The rest of the world is just like blurring out,
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.600]   and all you can see is that.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.200]   And all of a sudden, it's become the most satisfying thing
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.680]   in the world, and you're gonna die if you don't get that.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.440]   And all of a sudden, just there's nothing else
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.420]   to think about.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.880]   And it seems like it's gonna be extraordinarily satisfying.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.280]   I've been there, and I understand that.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.200]   But let me remind you of who you are.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.040]   Let me remind you of your identity.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.480]   Esau, you aren't just about to trade away your identity.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.000]   You are about to trade away your very future with God.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.640]   Because Esau, I know you have no idea what a book is,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.160]   but your story is going to be written in a book,
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.240]   the most famous book of all time.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.720]   And God, listen to this, God, who is big on titles,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.360]   big on introductions, God Almighty, the all-powerful God,
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.140]   is going to introduce himself using your name.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.560]   That's in your future.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.760]   He is going to appear.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   This is what I would say to Esau.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.560]   Esau, God is going to appear to a man named Moses.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.600]   He's more famous than you'll ever be.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.920]   Sorry, nothing I can do about that.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.060]   But listen, God is going to introduce himself to Moses.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.140]   And he's going to say, "Moses, I am the God
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.300]   "of Abraham, Isaac, and Esau."
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.100]   That is in your future.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.900]   That's who you are.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.260]   And if that's not enough for you, Esau,
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.560]   I wanna tell you one more.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.540]   You have such a favored identity from God
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.540]   that there is going to be a savior of the world
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.300]   who doesn't just put a bandaid on things,
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.940]   who really fixes things.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.700]   God's already put the plan in motion
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.660]   that the savior named Jesus would come,
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.180]   and that he, many years from now, Esau,
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.220]   he would be able and willing to bridge the gap
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.380]   between all of mankind and God.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.460]   And he's your descendant.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.380]   He's your grandson, the Messiah, the King,
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.740]   the savior, the hero, is in your lineage.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.040]   And his book is the bestseller of all time.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.500]   It's called "The New Testament," Esau.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   And the first paragraph goes like this.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.420]   It tells a story, and your name's on the front page.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.420]   It says, "Abraham fathered Isaac, who fathered Esau."
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.720]   Now, I know your feeling is strong,
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.260]   but that's who you are.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.300]   And I wasn't there to stop him.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.780]   I wasn't there to stop him, to make his bad trade.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.540]   And nobody usually comes to stop us.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.860]   And it says,
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:19:00.740]   "He swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.220]   "Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.840]   "He ate and drank and rose and went on his way.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.580]   "Thus Esau despised the birthright."
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.060]   The birthright was gone forever,
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.940]   and the feeling was gone for a little while.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.180]   And it was one of the worst trades in history.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.100]   And if you open your Bible today, this very evening,
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.060]   if you open your Bible to the right page,
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.820]   you will find that God introduced himself to Moses
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.920]   as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.220]   And the most famous book ever written, "The New Testament,"
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.780]   which is about the savior, the hero of all mankind,
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.820]   who would bridge the gap between God and man forever.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.380]   If you go to the front page of that New Testament,
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.620]   it's called Matthew chapter one, and you start to read.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.020]   It says on that page, in that very book, right this moment,
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.060]   it says, "Abraham was the father of Isaac,
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.220]   "who was the father of Jacob."
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.300]   Because of a feeling,
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:02.020]   because of an unchecked want, because of a desire,
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.920]   because of amnesia toward an identity.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.420]   And it's unbelievable.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.820]   You think, who would do something like this?
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.180]   Like, who would do that?
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.440]   What a terrible trade.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.780]   This is one of the worst trades.
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.820]   Like, anybody with common sense can do that.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.580]   Who in the world would be willing to make a trade like that?
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.300]   And the answer is, you might.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.220]   People do it all the time.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:29.300]   People throw away their families for 10 minutes of pleasure.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.340]   That's a bad trade.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.220]   How can that be?
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.540]   People get into relationships that they should not be in
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.580]   because of a feeling.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.900]   People get out of relationships that they should be in
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.580]   because of a feeling.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.480]   People forfeit a healthy sex life for pleasure right now.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.660]   That's normal, unfortunately.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.380]   Because feelings can cost you everything.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.540]   Because they say, you know what?
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.420]   Just trade the ultimate for the immediate.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.840]   Just trade the everything for something small.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.580]   Trade something that's priceless
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.020]   for something really cheap.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.900]   Trade something eternal for something that's just temporary.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.900]   That's what feelings might and will tell you to do.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.820]   Most people trade their identity for their feelings.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.660]   That's a fact.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.940]   And they miss everything that's valuable.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.100]   So I just wanna ask you tonight,
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.140]   what is your bowl of stew?
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.060]   What is the thing, what is the thing
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.620]   that if your feelings go unchecked,
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.420]   it seems extraordinarily satisfying?
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.580]   It seems like there's nothing else in the room
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.780]   or out of the room that's worth feeling
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.220]   or thinking about except that one thing.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.060]   What is it?
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.540]   Maybe it's money.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.660]   You wanna be successful.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.300]   You have a feeling where you're like,
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.180]   hey, success for me equals money
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.460]   and I wanna be the rich guy.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.660]   And the feeling is going to turn into the identity.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.060]   And so you're just following that feeling
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.060]   and following and following
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.580]   and thinking that an identity is going to come from that.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.640]   And instead of finding an identity,
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.320]   you're losing the one God is trying to give you.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.000]   Maybe it's a relationship.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.940]   A relationship with someone
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.940]   that you know in your most honest moment
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.860]   is not the right one.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.660]   You know God loves that person
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.040]   and Jesus died for that person,
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.080]   but you know in your very most honest moment,
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.900]   if you were to look at yourself openly,
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.100]   you know you're trading your future with God
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.500]   because you want a relationship
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.100]   worse than you want one with him.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   Happens all the time.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.840]   Maybe it's some kind of sex.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.100]   Maybe it's the kind of sex with a certain person
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.620]   or a certain kind of sex on your terms.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.680]   And the world will applaud you and tell you good trade
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.980]   when you trade God for sex.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.300]   And it's a really bad trade.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.340]   I've tried that.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.440]   It's not a good trade.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.220]   You won't find who you are if you make that trade.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.080]   You will lose who God says you are.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.300]   Maybe it's affirmation.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.580]   You know, you just really wanna be affirmed.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.220]   If you could, you really wanna be affirmed.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.620]   And so you start to think thoughts like this.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   You think, okay, you know what?
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.680]   I'll let him come up and talk to me,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.900]   but I'm not gonna let him buy me a drink.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.420]   Okay, I'll let him buy me a drink,
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.360]   but I'm not gonna walk out with him.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.340]   Okay, I'll walk out with him,
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.620]   but I'm not gonna let him walk me to the door.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.700]   Okay, I'll let him walk me to the door,
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.580]   but I'm not gonna let him come inside.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.540]   Okay, I'm gonna let him come inside,
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.860]   but I'm not gonna let him lay down with me.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.860]   Okay, I'll let him lay down with me, but.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.620]   And before you know it,
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.620]   who you are and who you want to be
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.900]   is nowhere to be found.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.460]   You forgot because of a feeling,
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.900]   because of a desire, because of a want.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.540]   And the good news is you can make bad trades for a lifetime
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.680]   and you can never lose God's love.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.520]   Did you know that?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   God's love is permanent.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.440]   You cannot lose God's love in a million years.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.280]   You can lose God's best plan for you in five minutes.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.500]   You can lose it right now.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.580]   You can lose it in a moment.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.660]   You can lose it with a decision.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.360]   That's the power of a feeling.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.100]   Now, I've had this little voice in the back of my head
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.040]   as I've been talking,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.440]   and I know many of you feel like,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.700]   well, that would have been helpful to know about a year ago,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.180]   or that would have been helpful to know about five years ago
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.360]   or maybe even 10 years ago.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.580]   That would have been really nice to know.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.420]   But I want to tell you this.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.240]   We can't talk our way out of the past,
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.680]   but we can follow God's identity for us into the future.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.920]   You can't change the past, but guess what?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.720]   Paul, who wrote the New Testament, some of it,
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.520]   he knew, he knew his past was gross,
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.840]   but he said, "Forgetting what's behind
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.020]   "and straining toward what's ahead,
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.600]   "I press on to take hold of Christ."
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.880]   All right?
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.580]   So we can't undo the past.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.680]   You can't undo your past bad trades,
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.460]   but you can hear God's identity for you
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.080]   and then filter your feelings in the future.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.920]   And so I just want to help you make a plan
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.900]   to do that if you would.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.400]   All right, so here are a couple of ways that you can do that.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.920]   Number one is to simply make a plan.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.520]   One, make a plan.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.400]   Nobody plans to throw their identity away.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.940]   They don't plan not to.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.800]   Nobody plans to throw their identity away.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.060]   They just don't plan not to.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.160]   If you don't know what to plan against,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.200]   you are already without a chance.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.940]   Like you have to know what to plan against.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.320]   I know exactly what mine are.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.080]   It's sex and selfishness.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.660]   I got married three months ago
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.740]   and I work on a church staff.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.540]   If you think that means the opposite gender
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.940]   is no longer a temptation, you are dead wrong.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.960]   It is a problem.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:16.460]   It still can be a very attractive bowl of stew to me.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.020]   Selfishness is another one for me.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.620]   I know that.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.140]   Selfishness, meaning I think about me
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.600]   when I should be thinking about my wife.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.780]   I think about me when I should be thinking about my job.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.580]   I think about me when I should be thinking about you
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.980]   right now instead of hoping you like this sermon.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.760]   Sex and selfishness, those are bowls of stew for me.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.180]   They tempt me to make a bad trade.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.500]   They tempt me to trade the ultimate for the immediate.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.720]   And so what are yours?
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.120]   You've got to know and you've got to make a plan.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.560]   Here's one idea.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.340]   Stop putting yourself in situations
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.180]   where the situation has all the leverage.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.020]   You know what I mean by that?
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.360]   Like, hey, here's an idea.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.120]   Don't go out into the woods without a lunch
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.360]   and come back hungry and thirsty
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.640]   where your little brother is in control of everything.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.920]   'Cause you know he cooks.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.960]   And you know he lies.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   Why would you go out there and get yourself tired
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.600]   and come in this room and think everything's gonna be okay?
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.080]   Stop doing that.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.440]   Here's how we do this.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.840]   Some of you are like mystified
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.200]   because you can't go to the bar
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.760]   without getting in a bar fight.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.480]   You're like, I gotta find a way to outsmart the situation,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.680]   man, like I can't go to the bar without getting in a bar fight
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.760]   like I think I'm going to
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.480]   and then every time it's like bar fight, you know,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.320]   it's crazy.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.280]   Listen, let me help you.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.360]   Stop going to the bar.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.120]   You just outsmarted the whole thing, all right?
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.800]   You just stop going.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.880]   Make a plan, don't go there.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   And I know some of you are like,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.840]   oh, you know, that's just who I am.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.880]   You know, that's kind of my thing.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.040]   You know, I'm a bar guy, you're a dumb guy.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.280]   Stop going there.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.860]   Make a plan, make a plan.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.560]   Don't put yourself in a situation
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.600]   where the situation has all the leverage.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.640]   Secondly, widen the circle.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.560]   Tell people your feelings, tell them what you're feeling.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.860]   I know that is so scary to some of you guys.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.240]   Tell people what you're feeling, invite them in.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.560]   This is what you do at 2 a.m.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.760]   Okay, when you are tempted to get up and masturbate.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.040]   You're like, 2 a.m.?
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.880]   Yeah, 2 a.m., you call them and you say,
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.720]   hey, here's what's going on,
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.360]   that thing that's a really bad idea.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.080]   You know what, it feels like a really good idea right now.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.720]   And so can someone talk me off the ledge here?
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.240]   I'm sorry I woke you up, but guess what?
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.440]   We're supposed to keep watch on each other,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.200]   says the Bible, and this is what you signed up for
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.400]   if you keep a watch on me, all right?
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.800]   And so I'm just gonna let you know
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.600]   what's happening right now, all right?
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.280]   Number two, widen the circle.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.860]   Let somebody know, let somebody in.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.280]   Number three, count the cost.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.760]   Slow the situation down.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.360]   Say the choice out loud.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.700]   It's not a guaranteed fix,
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.500]   but you'd be surprised how much you slow down
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.480]   if you start to talk out loud.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.560]   Say things like this to yourself.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.120]   I'm about to trade my birthright for a bowl of stew.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.680]   Say things like that out loud.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.240]   Hey, I'm about to go in big debt
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.040]   because I feel like I should drive a better looking car.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.800]   I'm about to throw away my purity
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.080]   so that I can enter into a promiscuous lifestyle
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.960]   because that feels good.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.160]   Say the choice out loud.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.440]   You'll be surprised how much you slow down
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.840]   when you hear the price tag.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.440]   Make a plan, widen the circle, and count the cost.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.540]   And the last thing I wanna say
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.520]   is we know that this is not easy.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.660]   This is really hard.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.580]   It is hard to fight feelings.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.260]   It is much easier to embrace your feelings
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.980]   and say that's who I am.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.660]   If I feel that desire, want, pain, hurt,
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.300]   I'm just gonna follow that until it becomes who I am.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.860]   It is hard work to fight feelings
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.300]   and filter your feelings through your identity
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.420]   that's from God.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.540]   And I want you to know that we at least
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.340]   have an example in Christ.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.520]   Did you know that Christ one time had an opportunity
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.320]   to follow his feelings or to follow God's will for his life?
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.160]   He had that opportunity.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.120]   You know, Jesus was fully God and fully human.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.320]   He was fully human.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.920]   He experienced the full force of all human emotions.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.520]   He knows what it is to be human.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.440]   He knew it.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.740]   And the night he was going to be arrested
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.160]   for sins he did not commit,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.360]   there was a moment where Jesus,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.120]   with all of his humanity, did not feel
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.520]   like doing what he came to do.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.720]   It's in Matthew chapter 26.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.060]   It says, "Jesus said to them,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.880]   "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death."
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.180]   That's a feeling, a big one.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:08.280]   The stress was so much he sweated blood, we're told.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.020]   And going a little farther, he fell on his face and said,
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.640]   "Father, if it's possible, let this cup pass from me."
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.300]   Meaning, if any way, I don't wanna battle this anymore.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.140]   God, take this away.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.120]   You ever prayed about like that, about a feeling?
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.960]   God, take this away.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.920]   I don't wanna do this anymore.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.260]   Is this the right thing?
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.480]   And then he says, "Nevertheless,"
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.200]   meaning no matter what,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.060]   "not as I will, not as I feel,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.380]   "but as you will."
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.060]   And he laid his feelings down,
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.200]   to experience feelings that he should never have had
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.800]   to experience, so that we can experience things
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.000]   that we never deserved.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.300]   That's what Jesus did.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.520]   The hero, the son of God.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.780]   And I know some of you are like,
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.240]   well, that didn't help me, he's Jesus.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.480]   I mean, he's perfect, right?
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.200]   Jesus experienced every kind of weakness that we have.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.300]   And the scripture says, even still,
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.840]   the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.280]   dwells in you.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.680]   It also says, no temptation has seized you.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.520]   That's not common.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.760]   God's faithful.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.640]   He'll provide a way.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.120]   And so I am not up here to tell you
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.120]   to just grit up and ball your fists and say,
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.160]   you can do it, because listen, you can't do it.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.480]   I'm saying with Christ, you can do it.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.840]   It can be done.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   Let's pray together.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.580]   God, will you give us the presence of mind
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.820]   not to get amnesia when it counts, God.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.780]   Not to embrace feelings, but to filter them,
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.300]   to think through them, to consider our wants,
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.340]   to consider our pains, to consider our doubts,
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.220]   to consider where they're driving us
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.820]   and where they are taking us.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.420]   Help us to slow down, God.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.460]   Not to try to be good people,
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.820]   but because the only man who ever was good
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.900]   was willing to slow down and say, God, not as I will.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.540]   I don't feel like doing this, God, but not as I feel.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.100]   But as you will.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.420]   Help us, God, to be the kind of people
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.420]   who say, nevertheless, God, no matter what, God,
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.700]   if I'm in this battle forever,
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.500]   no matter how much it hurts, God,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.820]   I am going to trust you.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.380]   I will not bow to a feeling.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.500]   Not in the middle of the night, not in the middle of the day.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.960]   Not by my strength, God, but only by yours.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.860]   Thank you, Jesus Christ, Son of God,
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.500]   that you showed us how to do that exact thing.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.580]   We are not strong, God.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.860]   We are weak, and we need you desperately
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.420]   to tell us who we are.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.700]   Save us from the futility of going off
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.980]   and trying to find out who we are
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.260]   by following our feelings.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.220]   Help us, God, to listen to you when you say who we are.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.980]   You have authority to say who we are.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.540]   No one else gets a chance.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.480]   You tell us, God, and then help us follow you,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.860]   because we are gonna follow our feelings
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.100]   in every wrong direction.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.380]   Help us, God, to submit ourselves to you
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.580]   and entrust ourselves to you who judge justly,
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.540]   just as Christ did.
