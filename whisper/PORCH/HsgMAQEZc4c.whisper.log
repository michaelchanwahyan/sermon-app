[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   [Music]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   How we doing?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Shout out to Fort Worth and Houston and Tulsa and El Paso and Chicago and Florida and South Africa.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Young adults around the world, changing the world. I love it.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It's so great to be with you guys. So great to be with you guys.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I want to start this evening by introducing you to someone.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   His name is Vinny and he desires to be a genderless alien.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And so what that means is he has spent $50,000 on over 110 procedures to make him a genderless alien.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   He's had two rhinoplasty's, he's had cheek implants, brow implants, lip filler, lots of surgeries, lots of money spent.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Here he is. There is Vinny. He has plans to spend... Nice.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yeah, he'll be waiting for you up front.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   He has plans to spend another $160,000 on removing his genitals, his nipples, and his belly button.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   No whistle on that? Okay, alright.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It sounds crazy, huh? Sounds crazy.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   The source of what he's doing is not crazy. It's not out of the ordinary.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   It's not abnormal. Not even strange. Really, really normal.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   See, the source of what Vinny's doing is he's following his heart.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   That's the advice. I watched him on Botched and a couple other interviews that he did.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And that's the advice his friends have given him.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   "Hey, Vinny, you should do whatever you feel like doing. If that's what you feel like, if you feel like a non-sexual alien, then that is what you should become."
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And you and I are guilty of the exact same things that he's doing.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And maybe we can pull it off better than he is. Maybe we don't look so noticeably different as he does.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   But all of us have followed our feelings, our emotions, our gut.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   This thing that we have inside that takes us in and out of jobs and in and out of relationships.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You say, "I don't want to work. I want to work wherever I feel like working."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Or, "I don't feel like doing this job anymore, so I'm leaving."
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So it's just to say, "I don't enjoy it," or "I'm not fulfilled by it."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Or, "I want to date whoever I feel like dating. I want to buy whatever I feel like buying. I want to do whatever I feel like doing."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And if I'm close to God or not, it's determined by how I feel.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   In fact, some of us don't have any other matrix for making decisions but how we feel.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That's become really, really normal today.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You look at a decision and you ask the question, "Well, if I'm going to go right or left, I'm going to base that decision on how I feel."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And that's really normal in 2017, but the Scripture tells us something really, really different.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And so I want you to think about your most shameful moment.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Maybe it was waking up to a stranger or looking at something that wasn't yours or lying in bed with the room spinning.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Maybe it's all of those things. Maybe it's something bigger.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Maybe it's deep regret that you felt from a decision that you made and you're wondering how you got there.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And I want you to know how you got there, just like Vinny did.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You got there following your desires.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You got there doing what you wanted to do.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And you think, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but JP, I'm not like alien boy."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Maybe not.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But some of the decisions that you'll make in your life are even less reversible than 110 procedures on your face.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And you can get there the exact same way.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So we're in this series called "Bad Advice," where we're going to look at advice that the world gives us,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   advice that your friends and your coworkers and maybe your family would say, "Hey, this is what you should do."
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And we're going to take that advice that's common today in today's culture,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and we're going to compare it to what the Scriptures say.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   This old, dusty book that was written by the creator of the heavens and the earth, given to us to follow it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I've never done what it said and regretted it many times.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I've not done what it said and regretted it every time.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   We're going to see some advice from thousands of years ago that I think you're going to see remarkably applicable to your life today.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   The advice that Vinny followed from his friends was very simple.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It's advice you followed.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It's follow your heart.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Follow your heart.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Bad advice number one, follow your heart.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And so when we follow our feelings, when we make decisions based on our feelings,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   we alienate ourselves from truth, which can be far more damaging than plastic surgery.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   See, the Scripture says in Jeremiah 17, verse 9, that the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Who can understand it?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And you say, but wait, JP, wait.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I've heard that the Holy Spirit gives me a new heart.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   When I trust it in Jesus, I've got a clean heart, a pure heart.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   That's only half the story, Jeremiah 17, verse 9.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   In fact, Romans 6, verse 17 says this, "But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I sought to reconcile these two ideas.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I asked an incredible theologian and friend of mine, Todd, and just said, "Hey, can we trust our regenerate heart, our new heart?"
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And he said, "Yes, but until you're with Christ, your degenerate heart or old heart is never fully dead.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And your new heart, your believing heart, your heart with God's Spirit is still corruptible by the things that you engage yourself in this world."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   This is very important for us to understand, and it's what the Scripture teaches tonight.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And so I want to convince you that if you fill your heart with the wrong things, it impacts what you are attracted to, how you think.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It causes destructive patterns in your life.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And in fact, you will waste your life chasing the next fleeting pursuit of your heart.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But if you fill your heart with the things of God, you will find healthy thinking, healthy living.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You will find life and have it abundantly.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Who doesn't want an abundant, full life?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So we're going to be in Proverbs chapter 4 this evening.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   The first nine chapters of Proverbs to set this up, it's written by a father speaking to a young child.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Solomon is most likely recorded these.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's ten lectures, and all the lectures have the same basic message.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It's this, "Value wisdom. Seek to become wise. Listen to the Father's teaching, and it will lead you to life."
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And so we're going to look at lecture 7 here in Proverbs chapter 4.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I'm going to read the whole thing, and we'll draw out some instructions, specifically how we don't follow an unguarded heart,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   what happens if you do, and how we, before you leave, how we inform our heart.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So Proverbs 4, starting in verse 20.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It says, "My son, pay attention."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   In the Hebrew, this is like a...
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   That's what I do with my kids.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Hey, look at me. Look at Daddy.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That's what it's saying here.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   "My son, pay attention to what I say. Turn your ear to my words.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Do not let them out of your sight. Keep them within your heart."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   See, your heart is a storage container for truth.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's a storage container.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   You can put lies in it. You can put truth in it.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   You can put whatever you want, but it's telling us it's where you store things.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   "For they are life to those who find them, and health to ones whole body."
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   That's the promise of this text, is life and health.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And then it says this, this is a very familiar text.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   "Ladies, above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   This is not just a text to women about dating.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Okay, that's not.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Men, I want you to listen to this.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   You're going to learn a lot this evening, too.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   "Keep your mouth free from perversity. Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Give careful thought to the paths of your feet, and be steadfast in all your ways.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Do not turn to the right or the left. Keep your foot far from evil."
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   We're going to unpack this text.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   So the scripture, it's saying right here, it doesn't say follow your heart, it says to guard it.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   My first point is this, don't follow an unguarded heart.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Don't follow an unguarded heart.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Verse 23, verse half, "Above all else, guard your heart."
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   What does it mean?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It means this, "Be careful what you let in."
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Do we think about this enough, what we're letting in our heart?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   This word for guard, it's how you would guard a castle in this time.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Somebody armed would stand up front, and they would be ready to kill with force any enemy that is willing to come in.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   They would take them with force, saying, "This is how you guard your heart.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   You protect it. You decide what goes on."
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   You protect it. You decide what goes in and what comes out with an armed soldier.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And it's not just this command, like I said, for ladies who are dating.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's very relevant. It says to keep your heart.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   That word keep, your text might say keep, it's like preserve it, like keep it from going bad, like did the milk keep?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And it's telling us something really key.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Your heart can go bad.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Your heart can spoil.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Your heart can turn on you.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   It can become this untrustworthy thing.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And he says, "Above all else."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Maybe yours says, "With all vigilance or with all diligence."
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   He's saying more than anything.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Why would he say God?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   God, the creator, the one you believe in, if you're here and you're a follower of Christ, you've trusted in this God,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   you've got your life in his hands, and he's telling you something really key.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   More than you guard anything, guard your heart.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   More than you guard your truck with an alarm.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   More than you guard your apartment with an alarm.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   More than you would put your money in an FDIC-insured bank with pillars and a vault.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   More than you'd guard any other single thing that you possess.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Spend more time, energy, and resources into guarding your heart.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   The heart is the most protected vital organ, but we're not talking about that thing that pumps blood inside of you.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   We're talking about your emotional quotient.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   We're talking about the inner core of a person, your thoughts, your feelings, your desires, your values, your will,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and choices that make a person who he or she is.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Your heart.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And it's fragile and valuable and powerful.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   You protect things that are fragile and valuable and powerful.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Why?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Think about it for a minute.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Recently I got some terrible news.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   A dear friend of ours, they were pregnant.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   We celebrated that, and they lost their baby in the womb.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   So sad.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I was grieving with them.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   My day was going great.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Everything was going great.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I was working on this message, actually.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   All things were, you know, birds chirping, sun shining, sky's blue, temperature's perfect.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   All is right in the world.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And this news comes into my heart by way of my ears, through my brain, into my emotional quotient,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and turns my world upside down in a moment.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And all of a sudden the world fades to gray scale.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Food, I ate at my favorite place, ate my favorite burger on this day, and just tasted blah.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   God felt far.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Not that he was far, he felt far.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   You ever done that?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Maybe for you it wasn't the loss of a child.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Maybe it was a breakup.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You ever done this?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Woke up not feeling like you wanted to get out of bed.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Like everything's wrong.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Maybe some of you are right there right now, but others of you, you can remember where you were.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   You're not there right now.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You've healed.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Times change things, but in that moment it felt hopeless.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Why?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Because your heart, something crept in your heart and turned it.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And it turned your life.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Do you see how powerful this is?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Feelings, they're so powerful.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   You guys ever seen Pixar's Inside Out?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'm sorry, it's going to be a tough illustration.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I'm interested in Pixar.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   They're so good at what they do, and I've learned in reading about them how they make these blockbusters.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   They ask a simple question, and it's this question, "What if blank had feelings?"
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You tracking with me?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   They ask, "Hey, what if something had feelings?"
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Some of you are confused.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Let me give you an example.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   In 1995, they asked, "What if toys had feelings?"
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   What's that?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Okay, in '98, they asked, "What if bugs had feelings?"
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Okay, okay.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And then they asked in 2001, "What if monsters had feelings?"
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Okay, now we're playing.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And then they said, "What if fish had feelings?"
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Yeah, and then they said, "What if cars had feelings?"
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And then they said, "What if rats had feelings?"
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And then they said, "What if robots had feelings?"
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And then they asked, "What if Scotland had feelings?"
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Okay, that was a tough one.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And then do you know what they asked in 2015?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   "What if feelings had feelings?"
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Yeah, Inside Out.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Eager, like, "Pixar!"
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   "What if feelings had feelings?"
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   And you see this, the plot is this little girl, Riley,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   and she has these five emotions that are personified inside of her,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   and they're joy and sadness, fear, disgust, and anger.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And then what happens as the plot moves forward is sadness and joy get lost,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   leaving only disgust, fear, and anger,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   kind of personifying, basically, adolescence.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And you see this girl and her life and where her feelings carry her.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I mean, is there anything greater than feeling pure joy,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   and anything worse than sitting in deep sorrow?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I tell you that.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I'm trying to make the point that this text wants you to understand
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   is how you feel is powerful.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   In fact, it's so powerful, it takes you places.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   It takes you places.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   It carries you somewhere.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   We guard our heart because everything in our life flows from it.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Second point, an unguarded heart will lead you astray.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   An unguarded heart will lead you astray.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   This is what he's saying in the second part of this verse in 23.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Everything you do flows from it.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   I have my girls tell me this verse every single day before I drop them off at school.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Proverbs 4:23, every day.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Why?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Because if your heart is not doing well, then you're not doing well.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   If your heart's not okay, then you're not okay.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And what goes in your heart determines what comes out of your words
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   and your actions and your life.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Matthew 15 says it like this,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   "But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   "and these defile them.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   "For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   "theft, false testimony, and slander,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   "and these are what defile a person."
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   A little over a year ago,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   my girl's grandparents, Monica's parents,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   got them iPod Touches for Christmas.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   iPod Touch, they call them their phones
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   because they're like an iPhone, but they just don't make calls.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   They're like an iPad Mini.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And so they have these things, they call their phones.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And I watched as everything about them changed,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   this little bitty device.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   They would wake up in the morning,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   and they used to come into our room, first thing.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   They would go into the living room, they'd grab their phone off the charger,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   and they'd begin to play these games.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I watched how it affected their mood.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   I watched how they would fight over them and argue over them.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I watched how if their phone ran out of battery,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   then all of a sudden they were grumpy.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And I watched how they started, like, the way they talked changed,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and they would say weird things like, "Daddy, I gotta go check on my dragons."
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   It was some weird game or something.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And I'm like, "Why do you gotta check on your dragons?"
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And they're like, "Oh, because, Daddy, they're making babies."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   I'm like, "What kind of dragons are these?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   "What is your mother letting you do?"
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And I'm watching this, and I'm like, "This is crazy."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And I went to talk to them. I sat them both down.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And I said, "Girls, I think you're addicted to your phones."
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And they said, "Daddy, aren't you addicted to your phone?"
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And so I kicked them out.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Aren't these little LCD screens like IVs into our heart?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Are they not feeding our heart?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Whether it's TV or computer or a phone,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   just pumping information into our heart?
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And see, what we see determines what we think,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   which determines how we feel, which determines what we do.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   What we see determines what we think,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   which determines how we feel, which determines what we do.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   In fact, what goes into our heart determines what flows out of our life.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And I see it every single day, week in and week out.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   I'll stand up here, and somebody will come up,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and it'll be some sweet young lady.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   "JP, I need help." "Why do you need help?"
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   "How can I help you? How can I pray for you? What can I do for you?"
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   "JP, man, you just, man, I only date losers."
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   "I don't know what's wrong with me."
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   "It seems I'm only attracted to losers, bad guys."
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   "What's wrong with me? Help me. Got a magic verse or something."
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Let me ask you a few questions.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Will you answer these questions honestly?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Sure, sure, I'll answer them honestly.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   They didn't even ask about purity or something.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   All right, what's your favorite TV shows, and what's your favorite songs?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   "Oh, JP, no, man, I'm asking dating advice."
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   "Dating advice? Oh, no, no, we're going to get to that in just a second.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Just humor me for a moment.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   What's your favorite shows? What's your favorite songs?"
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   "Oh, man, I don't know, dude. I don't know, man.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Two Broke Girls, you've seen that? It's pretty funny."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   "13 Reasons Why," I've been binging on Netflix.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   "The Bachelorette," new season.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Favorite songs, I don't know, man.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I don't know, you know.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Ed Sheeran, "Shape of You."
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   "I'm in love with your body."
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   You know that one? It's Lil' Drake, Lil' Jason Derulo.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I don't know, man. Calvin Harris, Nicki Minaj.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Lil' Weezy, I don't know.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   What? What? Dating advice.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Oh, man, I solved the mystery.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I know your problem. I know what's wrong with you.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You've gone to a university that has slowly educated you how to date losers.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   You basically have fed your heart slow information
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   that over time has taught you to be a professional loser dater.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   That's what you've become.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   It was a slow, meticulous plot by the enemy
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   to get you to a place where you would either never get married,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   be horribly married, resent life, resent the opposite sex,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   and have no idea what your problem is,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   all the while singing these familiar tunes that you love
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   while they carry you to a place further from where you want to be.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Doesn't it sound like something your mother would tell you?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I mean, does that not sound like something your Sunday school teacher--
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I know what I sound like right now.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   #dadlife, I get it, okay?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   But I'm just telling you God's on to something.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   My daughter comes in, she was singing--what is the song?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Oh, man, what was it?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It was like, "Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sipping,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   "yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missing.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   "Hey, hey, that looks like a toupee.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   "I make what you make in 10 years in two days."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I'm like--
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   You don't make anything.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   What are you saying right now?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   She's like, "I don't know.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   "The girls at school were singing it."
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   It's funny, right?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It's funny.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   You don't know either.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   You don't know.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   You don't know what he's saying.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Something about a model chick and Lamborghini, top missing, toupee.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   What's that got to do with anything?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   You don't know.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You have no idea.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   He's feeding this thing.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   He's just feeding it.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Don't sing stuff you don't know.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   You hear me?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It's taking you somewhere.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Why do I look in the rear view mirror and all I see is broken relationships?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   It's what you trained for.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Am I wrong?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Is the wisest man who's ever walked the planet Earth wrong?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Is the creator of the heavens and the Earth wrong?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Or maybe you're wrong.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Something to consider.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   If you're not careful with your heart, you're going to be somewhere.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   You're going to end up somewhere you don't want to be.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   A marriage you don't want to be in, an addiction that you can't shake,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   a harmful relationship, despair.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   All the while, the world is telling you to trust your heart, to follow your heart,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   to listen to your heart.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I go to a bunch of stories about this, a lot of personal stories,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   a lot of folks I've talked to, but one I'll put in front of you is
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Director Woody Allen, who left his wife, Mia Farrow, for her daughter,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   his stepdaughter, had an affair with his stepdaughter.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And he was interviewed by Time Magazine, and they said,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   "How could you do this?"
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And he had this infamous line, "The heart wants what it wants."
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   "The heart wants what it wants."
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Doesn't that sound beautiful?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Doesn't that just sound to completely justify having an extramarital affair
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   with your daughter?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   "The heart wants what it wants."
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Interesting, the way that he was caught is his wife, Mia Farrow,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   found nude pictures of her daughter in his possession.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And what I'm here to tell you is the heart doesn't want what it wants.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   The heart wants what it's fed.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   The heart doesn't want what it wants.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   It wants what it's fed, what it's taught, what it's told,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   what it's instructed, what it's shown over time.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   The heart wants what it's fed.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   You feed your heart.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   It's like a bloodhound on a search, seeking the next thing to devour.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   It wants more of whatever you gave it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   It's the lie of one last time.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I'm going to look at porn one last time.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You fed something, an appetite that grew from that one last time.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   That was the lie you believed, and it's killing you.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's killing you, our heart.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   It works like Netflix.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Remember that line on Netflix, the "because you watched" line?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   You can't get away with looking at something you shouldn't on Netflix
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   because your roommates will be like, "Oh, I see, because you watched that,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   here's all that," right?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   You know, the laughter of familiarity is like, "Hey, here's the deal.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It's like because you saw that, you should see this and this and this and this.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Because you watched that one, watch this one, watch this."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Your heart works that way.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   It's like, "Oh, you want to look at that? Let me give you more.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Let me give you more. Look, it's over there. Look, it's over there.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   It's over there. It's over there."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   It's like a bloodhound, right?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And it feeds and it changes the way that we think.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   My wife and I will watch Fixer Upper.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   You guys ever see Fixer Upper?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Like we're watching Fixer Upper.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I'm like, "Man, that's amazing, all the shiplap, and that's awesome."
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Listen, babe, listen, I think that we should sell our perfectly good house
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   and buy a condemned house so that we can fix it up.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   It's a great idea.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   We'll watch Shark Tank, you know?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And then all of a sudden I'm walking around, I'm like,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   "Dude, I could totally--I got this idea for this invention, so hold your phone.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I just need to talk to Mark Cuban. It's going to be amazing, you know?"
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   You watch The Bachelor, and you're like,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   "I want to go on a date with 28 guys or girls or whatever.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   That seems like a good idea."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And you're like, "No, I don't, no, I don't."
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   But you're jealous of someone who did.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   How crazy is that?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   You envy and covet someone who did.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Why? Because you fed your heart.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   That's why.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's not complicated.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Social media, man, that's a big one.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   I had to delete Instagram from my phone because you guys,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   you all like live on a vacation.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Holy cow, like some of you live in Hawaii or something.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Like everywhere I look, I mean, just today I look at Instagram,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and David Marvin is in Mexico with his wife,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and my day was going perfectly fine, and all of a sudden I'm like,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   "Why am I not in Mexico?"
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   You know?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   I'm here doing David's job.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Like, "What's up with that?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I need to get on a beach somewhere."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And it's just, heart, man.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   You're feeding it.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   It takes you places.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   So don't follow your heart.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Inform your heart.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   That's worth writing down, tweeting, sending out, posting,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   spray painting under a bridge.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   No, don't do that.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Don't follow your heart.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Inform your heart.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   My third point is don't follow your heart until you inform your heart.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   See, when my girls were addicted to their phones, as their dad,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I didn't know what to do, which is stupid,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   because I can just say, "Mine.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Stop that."
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   I can close that off.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And there's a war over the real estate of our hearts.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And so the wisest man ever to live is going to give us three things to consider,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   verses 24 through 27, and we'll end with this.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   He says, "First of all, I want you to keep your mouth free of perversity.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   This is how you guard your heart.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Watch what you say."
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   One of the ways that you can guard your heart is you watch what you say.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Don't entertain perverse talk, Ephesians 4:29,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   "Let no one hold some talk come out of your mouth,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   but only what is helpful for building others up,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   so that it may benefit those who listen."
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Stop gossiping. Stop slandering. Stop cursing.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Stop talking, "Oh, man, wow, look at her.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Wow, what I do with that."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Stop it.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   You're not in junior high locker room.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Be careful what you say.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   It's affecting your heart and your life.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Even sarcasm, like sarcasm can poison your heart
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   if you give yourself to it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And you're like, "Man, dude, Sunday school talk."
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Run your little experiment.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Like, leave here and see if I'm right.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Test it. Test all things.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   See what happens when you say those words,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   when you sing those lyrics,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   even though you don't know what they mean,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   what it does to your heart.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Let me show you what it does.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   If this is your heart, it does this.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   It just starts making it a little bit cloudy.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   A little bit cloudy.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   You're like, "Man, it doesn't even look cloudy right there.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I don't even see any cloudy."
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   But just a little bit, it just throws a tinge on this thing,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   this thing that you want to follow
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   just gets a little darker.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Verse 25, "Let your eyes look straight ahead.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Fix your gaze directly before you."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   This is a big one.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   "Be careful what you look at,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   because what you look at, you're feeding your heart."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And far too often, as I've said many times,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   far too often we're entertained by the things Christ died for.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Let me go close to home on this one.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   A couple weeks ago, a friend of mine called me,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and I love good movies.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Man, if you see a good movie, holler at your boy.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   I love good movies.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And he's like, "Hey, you've got to see this movie."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And so I watch it.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   I ask him, I always ask, "Hey, is there any nudity?"
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   He's like, "No, no nudity."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   So I watch it, but it just kind of glorified the club scene,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   the party scene, the past life, the old me.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   And then in one scene, there's one scene for just a moment,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   dude's in a club, and it's not even a strip club,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   but there's these two girls wearing hardly anything,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   dancing on a table, and I see it, and it doesn't take long,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   and I'd love to tell you, he's like, "Man, I'm a pastor at the porch
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   "and a lover of Jesus, and so I cut it off
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   "and ran the other direction."
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   But I didn't.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I didn't.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I continued to just spoon-feed my heart.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And the next day, you know what happened?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I woke up, and I noticed every curvy girl in my path,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   like girls I'm not married to, and others than my wife, Monica.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And my head's on a swill, like, "Oh, wow, what's wrong with me?
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   "Oh, I remember I fed my heart for about 22 seconds,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   "a scene in a movie that wasn't even what the world would call pornographic,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   "and it messed me up."
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And so when you talk about really messing you up,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   when you indulge pornography, see, some of you,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   you're going into your room or your bathroom with your cell phone
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   or your computer or laptop, and you are indulging
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   in an extramarital affair with someone you've never met,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   a two-dimensional object, and it is messing you up
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   more than you ever could realize.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   And I know from experience--I'm a porn addict in recovery.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I ruined my marriage long before I ever even met my wife.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   We spent the last 12 years healing from my choices
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   before we got married, before I met her.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And that's what you're doing, and it will turn your heart.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And maybe pornography--maybe you're here, and pornography's not your issue.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Maybe it's just romantic comedies.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   You're sitting there, you watch it, and you wake up the next day
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   because you're single.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   How did this happen? When am I going to find someone?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   What's wrong with me? And you don't know why.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Oh, you watch that movie.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   You're feeding your heart discontentment,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and you don't realize it, but it just turns a little bit,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   if this is your heart, right?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   You just--a little romantic comedy, right?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   A little pornography just gets a little cloudier,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   a little cloudier, a little less trustworthy.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Before I watch a movie, a free resource,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   you can get it in the App Store, plugged in,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   is a great resource for you to download.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   It will tell you if there's nudity or not.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   It will tell you the sexual content of the movie,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   language, that sort of thing.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Verse 26, "Give careful thought to the paths for your feet,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   "and be steadfast in all your ways.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   "Do not turn to the right or to the left.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   "Keep your foot from evil."
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   He said, "Hey, be careful where you go and who you're with."
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Okay? We say all the time here,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   you may need to change your playmates in your playground.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   That may be what you need to do.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   If you're asking right now,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   "I wonder if I need to change my playmates in my playground,"
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I can pretty much guarantee you you do.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And so let me walk you through what that looks like,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   because people are like, "JP, are you saying
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   "that I should just get rid of all my friends?"
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Yes, and they say, "Well, how do I do that?"
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And I say, "You delete all their numbers.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   "You send them a text, maybe, courtesy text.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   "We can't hang out anymore.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   "You know, that's how you do it."
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And like, that sounds rude. It sounds like survival.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Like some of you are like, "Man, I'm so tired of getting drunk."
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Well, cool. Hang out with sober people.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Okay? That will help a lot.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   And you're like, "Dude, you want me to get rid of all my friends?
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   "That sounds so lonely."
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Look around you.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Like, I don't know where you're at listening to this,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   but my hunch is you're probably surrounded by some Christians.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And you could stick out your hand and say,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   "Hey, nice to meet you.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   "Can you help me?"
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   (laughter)
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Here in Dallas, we have Open Community Group.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   You're going to walk in these rooms here in a minute.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And you're going to be friends.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Okay? We can help you.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   We see people do it all the time. It changes their life.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I know it's hard, but it's not complicated.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   It may feel difficult, but it's not complicated.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And so it says, "Keep your foot far from evil."
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   This is an easy one.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   If something seems evil, stay far from it.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Don't think about it. Don't entertain it.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Get away from it.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And so you're like, "Well, what's evil?"
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   See, something good can be evil when it becomes ultimate.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Something that's actually good can become something evil
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   when it becomes ultimate to you.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And so just be careful of what your idols are.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   But I think a lot of times I talk to people,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   and they just don't have a good understanding of what's evil and what's not.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Like this other conversation that I have up here a lot is
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   guys will say, "Man, hey, my story is real similar to yours."
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And they'll kind of look away, and I'm like, "I know what that means.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   You're struggling with porn, huh?"
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And they'll say, "Yeah, man, I'm struggling with pornography."
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   "How do you access porn?"
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   "Oh, bro, my cell phone, iPhone."
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   "Okay, all right. Where's your phone?"
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   "Here in my pocket."
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   "Oh, I got you. I thought you said you were struggling with porn.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   You're carrying it around with you everywhere you go. That's different.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Can we agree that's different?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   See, you made it kind of sound like you were fighting it,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   like you were waging war with it.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   You're not waging war with it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You're carrying around a portal to all kinds of nude images
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   that you want at any time in your pocket."
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   "What do you want me to do, dude?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Do you want me to get rid of my phone?"
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   "Yes."
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   "You want me to be the only dude on the planet without a phone?"
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   "Yes."
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   "Man, that sounds legalistic."
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   No, turn to Matthew 5 where Jesus says, "Gouge out your eye,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and we can talk about legalistic."
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Where he says, "Cut off your hand,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   and we can talk about legalism."
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I'm just saying, "Get rid of your iPhone. You can get a flip phone."
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   You know?
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   "Dude, you want me to be the only uncool brother with a flip phone?"
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   "Yes, I do."
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   "You can have a clean heart. It'll be awesome.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Flip phone, clean heart, all is well in the world."
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   You've got to ask yourself, "What are the things that you're looking at?"
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Because it's poison to this thing.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   It's poison to your heart.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   You look at something, and before you realize it, right,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   it just messes it up.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   You just give it a little dose, a little dose over time.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   It turns on you, bro.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And how are you going to follow that?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   How are you going to trust that?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Where is that going to take you?
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And it just gets that way because of what you consume
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   and because of what you do faster than you realize.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   When you feed your heart more of what it asks for,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   often you feed it less of what it needs.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   And so what I'm telling you is that if you have a work obsession
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   or you're struggling with purity or sobriety or insecurities,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   would you just please consider what you're feeding your heart?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   You might be able to identify the problem.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   In summary, don't follow an unguarded heart.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   An unguarded heart will lead you astray.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And don't follow your heart until you inform your heart.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   It's interesting.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   As I was researching, our friend Vinny,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   he's actually a model.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   He does kind of some obscure shoots.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   If somebody's looking for someone who looks like an alien,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   then that's his occupation.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And he did this one that was entitled "My Heart is Poison."
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   So here's a picture of it.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   That's him behind the Photoshop or whatever that is.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   But the image is called "My Heart is Poison."
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   And as I saw that and preparing for this, I thought,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   "You know, he got it right."
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Like imagine if his friend said,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   "Vinny, I know you want to do this, but your heart is poisoned.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   "And you need a clean heart.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   "You need to clean your heart before you can trust it,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   "before you follow it."
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And so how do you clean your heart, right?
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   You're not going to grow closer to God
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   without doing the things that you know you need to do.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   There's no shortcuts.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   There's no way that you're just not going to wake up tomorrow
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   and end when the sun sets so much closer to God
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   without prayer and without studying the scriptures,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   without joining a community of believers
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   and without diving into a church and serving.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And so you can imagine, right?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   It's like, I don't know what to do.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   You can start with finding a church
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   and getting connected there, right?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And it will start to clean your heart a little bit, right?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Just a little bit, it will start to clean your heart.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   That was the wrong one, sorry.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Just a little bit, a little bit,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   it will start to clean your heart.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Not much at all.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   But then you start to study the scriptures,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   start to read the Bible,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   start to understand God's word,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   and a little more, right?
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It's just you're instructing your heart,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   you're showing it where to go,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   and a little more, it may get just a tiny bit lighter.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And then as you grow in your relationship with him
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and you incorporate the spiritual disciplines,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   you surround yourself with believers,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   folks who are holding you accountable,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and you change what you're doing
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   and the way that you're spending your time.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   And then before you realize it,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   God's Holy Spirit is purifying that
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   which the world sought to ruin.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   And you have a clean heart.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   And you think for a moment, you think,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   but doesn't Jesus clean my heart?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   See, some of you, your problem tonight
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   is not that you're not reading the Bible,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   not that you're not praying,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   and not that you're not a member of a church,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   and not that you're not in community.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   And it's not that you love Nicki Minaj,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   and it's not that you're watching 13 Reasons Why,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   and it's not that you cuss and gossip
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   and the things you say.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Your problem is you don't have a relationship
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   with the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   You have not trusted in his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   his provision for you on the cross,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   that he died for your abortion,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   that he died for your porn problem,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   that he died for the fact that you worship food
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   or you worship yourself
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   or you think about yourself too much,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   that he died for your impurity,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   that he died for your sex,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   the things that you've worshiped.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Christ died for them.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And you've heard that,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   and you have been to church before,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   you've read the scripture,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   but you haven't trusted in it.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And you're going through this life
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   with a broken, messed up, degenerate heart.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   And what I want you to know is right now,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   God desires to give you a new one,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   one that can work well,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   one that can consume the scripture,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   one that seeks relationships with other believers,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   one that desires to talk to God.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   If you're struggling with those things,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   you may consider, do I have a new heart?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   And you may go to God and you say,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   God, I have sinned against you
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   in the things that I've worshipped,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   in my relationships,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   in the way that I've dated
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   or the way that I've wanted to date,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   in the things that I've done,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   in the privacy of my bedroom.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I've sinned against you
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   in what I've drank, snorted, smoked, consumed.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I've ran from you.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I've flipped you off and ran the opposite direction.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   I've sinned against you in my self-righteousness,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   in my legalism,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   in my thinking that I'm good enough.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And God says, Son, Daughter, look at me.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   I love you.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I know you've done those things.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   He says he delights in forgiving us.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   He says, Paul's letter to the Corinthians,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   I'm no longer counting your sins against you.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Wow.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Would you just trust in my provision of my Son, Jesus?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   I love you. I hate your sin.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Someone has to die, so I did it.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Don't you get it? I did it for you.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Would you trust in that?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   It'll give you a clean heart.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   You can start anew tonight.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   A new heart.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   A new spirit.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   It'll put inside of you,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   take out your heart of stone
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   and give you a heart of flesh.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   It's great news.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Can we just pray for a minute?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I'm gonna lead you in prayer as we wrap up.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   It's gonna take some focus on your part.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   There's an enemy, he hates you.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   He's gonna try to distract you
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   with a lot of thoughts right now,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   and I just want you to stay focused
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   and close your eyes.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   I want you to ask God to reveal to you
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   idols hidden in your heart.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   The things you're tempted to love
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   more than him right now.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   If your mind's already drifted,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   God feels far, you've never done this before,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   you might start by asking him
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   to help you trust in the provision
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   of his son Jesus Christ
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   as a payment for your sins.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Stay focused.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   You're asking God to reveal idols in your heart.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Search deep, what are they?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Idols.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Things that you're tempted to love more than him.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   A relationship, material things, a job, money, you.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Ask God to reveal unhealthy habits
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   at the campuses.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   You too, ask God to reveal unhealthy habits
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   that could be shows that you can't miss,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   Utivo, music.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   It may be things you read or look at
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   that lure your heart away from him.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   God, would you please reveal to us
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   unhealthy habits, things we watch, listen to,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   things we read, things we look at,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   things we do.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Would you ask God to give you the courage
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   to take the steps necessary
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   to rid your life of evil?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   As you run an audit,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   you've embraced some things that are simply worldly.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   It may be weird, it may be different.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   You're called to be an alien, a stranger in a foreign land.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   God, would you help us to take the courage
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   to take the steps necessary to rid our lives of evil?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Stay focused if your mind has drifted.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Fight for it.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   There's an enemy who hates you.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Would you ask God to help you replace those things
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   with healthy habits of reading his word,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   praying regularly, talking to him,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   joining a church,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   surrounding yourself with what we call community,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   other believers.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   It's a makeover.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Make no mistake about it, it is a new life.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   It may be radical.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   That may be what you need to do right now,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   something crazy.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Ask him for help.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   You wake up tomorrow, start your day in his word.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   End this day by talking to him,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   joining a church, community.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Father in heaven, would you please reveal to us
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   the idols hidden in our heart,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   the things that we are tempted to love more than you?
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   And God, would you please help us to see
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   the unhealthy habits that we have,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   the shows that we watch,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   the music that we listen to,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   the literature that lures our heart away from you, God?
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   And would you give us the courage, please,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   to help us to take the steps necessary
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   to rid our lives of all things evil?
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   The things that we love more than you, God,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   would you remove them?
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Terrifying prayer.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Would you remove them?
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   And God, would you help us to replace those things
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   with healthy activities,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   the pursuit of you, the love for you,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   of reading your word, knowing your word,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   understanding it, studying it,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   praying, talking to you, God,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   joining a church, being under the authority
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   of leaders in a church
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   and joining a community of believers.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Would you take our hearts, Lord?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Would you speak what is true, Lord?
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
