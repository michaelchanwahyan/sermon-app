[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.740]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.700]   Hey there, my name is Garrett,
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.880]   and I served on the porch staff team here for six years.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.480]   And then two years ago, if you're in the room live,
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.580]   you heard David say just a moment ago,
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.540]   two years ago that my wife Gabby and I
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.940]   left Dallas-Fort Worth,
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.480]   which has been our home for quite a while,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.860]   and moved to New York City to begin a new church
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.180]   that launches this very month.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.180]   So we're very excited about that.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.500]   But here's the interesting thing about tonight
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.360]   is that I haven't been here in two years,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.560]   and research has shown that the porch crowd
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.200]   kind of almost does a full turnover about every two years,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.760]   which leaves me tonight starting by saying,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.900]   it's so good to see you guys.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.700]   And it leaves you saying, you too.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.540]   Who is that?
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.380]   And, but in any case, it's so good.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.740]   It's so good to be together
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.240]   and just to have a few moments of potential
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.580]   for God to move in our lives and hearts together.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.720]   Special shout out tonight, by the way,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.180]   to our friends in Boise
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.380]   and our friends in Scottsdale
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.220]   who are tuning in around the country.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.360]   Some of them are not around the country.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.260]   Some of my thinkers are sitting right over there,
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.720]   I think is what's going on.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.700]   So it's great to be together.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.620]   Listen, I'd love to start,
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020]   I'd love to start with a question tonight.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.900]   Tonight's about mission.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.000]   It's about being united in mission, specifically.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.940]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.260]   Maybe you've never reflected on this before.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.700]   Maybe you have, but here it comes.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.940]   What causes a person's life mission?
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.140]   And when I say mission tonight,
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.180]   I don't mean, when I say a person's life mission,
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.580]   I don't mean like their mood.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.780]   Like, you know, I'm on a mission to get some tacos today.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.340]   That's not a mission, that's a mood.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.780]   Okay, that's a desire, that's a want.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.460]   That can come and go, okay?
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.460]   I'm talking about a deep seated drive.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.320]   When I say your personal life mission,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.160]   I'm talking about a deep seated thing that makes you tick.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.400]   It makes you go, season by season,
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.600]   week after week, year after year.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.260]   It is your inner posture
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.900]   and set of desires and orientation.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.000]   I'm talking about the depths of you and your wants.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.840]   That's what I'm talking about
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300]   when I say a personal life mission.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.580]   What causes that to change dramatically
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.920]   from themselves to God?
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.480]   Because that does happen sometimes, right?
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.880]   How does a person go, and self can look in any way.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.080]   When I say their life mission being themselves,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.920]   that can look like anything.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.460]   That can look like chasing options, money, power,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.620]   pleasure, freedom, control, family, sex, achievement.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.660]   But underneath all those many diverse options,
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.600]   it is an expression of the self as mission.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.760]   Maybe even self improvement, a future version of the self.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.580]   How can it be that a person's inner life mission
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.380]   can go from totally self-oriented,
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.380]   totally locked into the mirror, if you will,
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.480]   the metaphorical mirror, to becoming about God,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.920]   essentially a mission to give the life away,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.220]   voluntarily just to give it away.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.380]   How does that change happen?
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.520]   And by way of introduction tonight,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.880]   since I'm aware most of us have not met,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.760]   I wanna tell you this shift of mission
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.660]   actually took place to me, in my life, in my heart.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.400]   And I can't show you a picture
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.960]   that really captures a life mission
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.200]   because we don't usually have our life's mission
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.560]   tattooed on our forehead.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.940]   But if I could show a before and after
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.700]   of a life mission photo, this would be pretty much it.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.040]   I ask you to be gracious.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.380]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.240]   So the guy on the, the guy on the left,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.380]   they told me this was a safe place.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.220]   It feels like it's room of judgment right now, okay?
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.320]   Listen, the guy on the left is a teenager in 2005.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.420]   You see the shell necklace.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.900]   And so this is not one, but two, as a matter of fact.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.660]   So try to get past the surface for a second.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.700]   And like, I wanna take you inside the mind of this person
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.800]   because I lived with him 24 hours a day.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.500]   And I can assure you that this person
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.140]   wants to live for himself.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.740]   His life's mission is indeed fully and utterly himself.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.320]   There is no bigger joy than himself.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.280]   There is no, the world's not bigger than himself.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   His biggest joy is sexual adventure on the weekends
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.020]   with little regard for the cost.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.980]   He is addicted to the party.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.180]   He is addicted to attention.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.220]   He's addicted to athletics and promiscuity,
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.520]   really just more outlets for himself.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.660]   He's a shameless narcissist, by the way.
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.000]   And if you're thinking right now,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.900]   man, Garrett, maybe you're being a little hard on yourself.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.600]   Oh, I assure you, I'm being a little easy on myself.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.300]   You just got the edited version, okay?
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.040]   I could bring people in here to let you know
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.700]   that I just gave you the sanitized version
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.580]   of how I was living prior to about the age of 20, okay?
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.020]   So that's a person who I know good and well
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.020]   was thoroughly engaged in a life mission for the self.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.960]   Now, this person on the right, this is a 30-year-old.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.120]   And this is us with everything we own in a U-Haul.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.820]   And we are on the way to New York City
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.960]   to begin, of all things, a church.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   This person, while still oft wrong,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.760]   often mistaken, often misled, and thoroughly imperfect,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.600]   this person's deepest desires have changed.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.000]   This person wants at a base level
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.800]   to live for something more.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.040]   This person wants not to live for himself.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.440]   This person wants to make life count.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.980]   The fear is not missing out on the weekend
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.380]   or some exploit of the weekend.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.380]   The fear is wasting the life
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.320]   and making it not count for something ultimate.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.020]   The entire life mission under the surface
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.220]   of these people have changed.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.820]   And I just wanna ask you, how can this be?
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.060]   The person on the left is a mission field.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.000]   That means a person that other people pray for and go,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.860]   "God, I just wish you'd get Garrett's attention.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.800]   "Please bring him to his knees
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.440]   "and show him that he needs you."
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.240]   You know, like that person is a mission field.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.840]   The person on the right is a missionary.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.200]   That means I'm now the person that's like,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.680]   "Oh God, will you get someone's attention?
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.740]   "Will you just bring them to their knees
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.080]   "and just show them that they need you?"
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.880]   I now pray the prayers for other people
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.580]   that people used to pray for me
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.080]   because I went from being a mission field to a missionary
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.620]   because my life mission went from myself to God.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.280]   That's a real change that I underwent in my life.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.360]   And what I wanna ask you to reflect on for a second is,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.120]   how does that happen?
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.100]   Because it might happen to you, right?
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.960]   How does this actually take place?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.060]   Some people try to explain this
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.260]   in all kinds of natural ways.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.100]   You know this, right?
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.940]   Some people would say,
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.060]   "Well, maybe you just grew up."
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.400]   But no, that can't quite cover it
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.240]   because guess what?
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.940]   There's no magic age you cross
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.240]   to where you just decide, "You know what?
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.180]   "I've had enough of me and I'm gonna live for God."
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.480]   We all, there's such a thing as a selfish 70, 80,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.740]   90 year old, that's a thing, right?
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.740]   So there's no magic number that where you just graduate
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.580]   from living for yourself.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.720]   So it can't be just age.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.560]   And some people would say,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.380]   "Well, you know what?
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.220]   "You're a pastor
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.120]   "and we can just give you a category to you.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.460]   "And that's just what pastors do is live for God."
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.800]   But wait, you have to start to live for God
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.460]   as a mission before you become a pastor.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.760]   You don't hire someone as a pastor
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   who doesn't live for God,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.840]   hoping they like change their mind.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.800]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.540]   So it had to come first.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.300]   The desire to live for God had to come first.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.140]   Someone would say,
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.300]   "Ah, I think the answer was right there
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.580]   "in that picture to your left."
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.540]   You probably married like a super Christian woman
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.640]   and just like had to like clean it up.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.580]   Well, she is a committed Christian,
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.840]   but that's not the primary influence.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.640]   I started to walk with God before we got married.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.480]   Someone would say,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.320]   "You know what?
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.160]   "I can explain this.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.980]   "You know what happened to you?
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.120]   "You made like a new year's resolution.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.880]   "You just like woke up one day
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.460]   "and you're the one guy for whom it worked."
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.360]   But here's the thing, discipline can't do it.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.520]   Discipline can only support the mission you already have.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.500]   It can't change you from the outside in.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.460]   That's not the way it works.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.840]   A change of mission comes from the inside out.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.500]   So it can't just be that I woke up one day
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.300]   and wanted to get serious about life.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.140]   Somebody would say,
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.980]   "You know what, bro?
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.800]   "I don't know.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.640]   "Look, maybe you went bald
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.480]   "and God was your only option."
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.300]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.940]   Like, I don't know what happened to you,
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.340]   but good for you.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.440]   And you know what?
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.040]   Whatever happened, I don't know,
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.320]   but whatever happened, it was rare, it was weird.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.820]   So I'm safe.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.120]   And I wanna tell you, that's exactly my point.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.020]   It's not weird and it's not rare.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.260]   It's happening to people on your row.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.960]   People in this room by the hundreds
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.660]   and in fact by the thousands
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.440]   are experiencing a change of desire to live for them.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.400]   This is happening in real time.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.240]   This is happening weekly.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.060]   This is happening in your city.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.540]   This is happening right now
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.600]   that people are actually experiencing
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.540]   a major and radical shift in real time
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.820]   from living for themselves to living for God.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.740]   It can happen to them.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.020]   It can happen to you.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.080]   And you know this is true.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.260]   I'll just make up a person that I haven't met tonight,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.460]   but I know is in this room
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.380]   and you know they are too.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.220]   So here they come.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.720]   He's 31 years old.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.160]   And six months ago, he lived for his career.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.100]   And he was determined to get all his identity
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.920]   from his career.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.460]   He's climbing the corporate ladder.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.200]   He was gonna make millionaire by 30,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.460]   didn't quite get there, but you know what?
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.760]   There's always early retirement
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.540]   and he is going to double down and make it.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.100]   And his journey is in the past is approximately this.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.180]   He went to the ball field as a little boy to get identity
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.140]   and he didn't get it.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.140]   And then as an adolescent,
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.080]   he went to the bedroom to get identity
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.920]   and he didn't get it.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.280]   And now he's gonna try the boardroom.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.180]   And if he can get power from the company,
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.620]   that somehow is going to,
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.160]   he's gonna worship his resume now.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.920]   And now he hasn't noticed yet
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.160]   that the target keeps changing
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.360]   and he's chasing a mirage
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.000]   and his identity can only come from God.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.220]   And that's where he was living a few months ago.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.260]   But now there's an after.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.440]   It's different.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.700]   And his parents have noticed.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.960]   He can't stop for some reason hanging around church.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.240]   And all of a sudden as he does his work,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.840]   he's calm because his identity isn't attached
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.780]   to his performance anymore.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.040]   And all of a sudden,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.080]   he doesn't worship some future version of himself
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.280]   in a corner office.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.520]   He worships God and does his work from a state of peace.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.320]   And all of a sudden the person he's dating is like,
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.620]   I think I'm dating someone else
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.120]   than the person I started dating
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.220]   because a change has radically happened
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.220]   in such a person's life.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.700]   That's happening all over this room.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.200]   Did you know that?
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.900]   I'll make up one more.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.660]   Here's a girl, 26 years old, six months ago,
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.500]   is looking back on her previous five years.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.460]   And you know what she sees?
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.640]   Guy A in her, guy B in her,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.740]   guy C in her, guy D in her.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.180]   They all have in common a guy in her
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.740]   because that was her mission.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.840]   But now all of a sudden,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.080]   all of a sudden, a radical change has happened.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.440]   She seems to operate from confidence.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.920]   She doesn't seem to operate
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.480]   as a person who is easily fooled or foolish.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.680]   She has a sense of peace.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.620]   She seems to draw her sense of self,
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.460]   not from who's beside her, but who is above her.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.620]   And no one knows, like,
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.720]   this transformation has taken place.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   How can this be?
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.060]   It's happening on your row.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.000]   And I just wanna preach tonight
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.360]   in a way that invites you, invites you,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.900]   not to see what causes that kind of a change, but who.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.240]   Because ultimately,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.640]   behind every one of these changes is a who.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.980]   And the hero of all this is not the change itself.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.440]   It's not the changed people.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   It is the who that does the changing
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.480]   and the mission that he directs us to.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.720]   I just wanna invite you.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.480]   I wanna invite you to give your life away tonight.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   So I have a humble goal.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.160]   Just give your life away.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.060]   That's all I'm after.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.500]   I want you to leverage your life for something that counts.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.160]   And I know in a room this big,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.520]   I know some of you are just unavailable.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.260]   You are mid-self mission.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.940]   And I just, I know, I've lived it.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.200]   I've been there.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.140]   If the person whose thought bubble, if I could see it,
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.600]   says, "You can't make me," trust me, I already know.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.100]   I know I can.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.300]   But I wanna invite you,
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.440]   because some of you in this room are available tonight.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.680]   That's the way it works.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.440]   There's always people who are available
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.920]   to be united in mission.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.520]   It doesn't matter if you're united in truth, in worship,
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.380]   if you don't, at the end of the day, excuse me,
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.220]   if you don't ultimately put it into practice
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.520]   to connect people with God and with one another.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.320]   So I'm gonna talk about mission tonight.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.520]   And I wanna introduce you to the one
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.760]   who will set you on the mission of a lifetime.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.400]   And that is, of course, the person of Jesus.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.360]   And I want you to see what it looks like
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.960]   when he orients his life around mission,
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.360]   which is a model for us and what it looks like for us.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.140]   All right, so I'm gonna take us to a story tonight.
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.980]   It's really just a moment.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.180]   It's a real moment in real time, in real history,
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.980]   2,000 years ago, where the person of Jesus
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.540]   interacts with some people.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.780]   And there are some words that have shaped my very life.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.840]   And I hope they will yours.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.340]   Here they come.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.340]   It starts like this.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.380]   "And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages,
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.420]   teaching in their synagogues and doing two things."
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.460]   This is very important tonight.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.000]   If you have any interest whatsoever in living on mission,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.200]   this is gonna really matter for you.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   "He was proclaiming the gospel
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.460]   and he was healing every disease and affliction."
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.840]   So he's doing two things.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.240]   They're paired together.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.280]   You gotta have 'em both or you're not doing the mission.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.100]   Here they are.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.140]   "Proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom Jesus was doing,
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.620]   and he was healing every disease and affliction."
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.840]   You could summarize this by saying
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.960]   he was speaking and he was serving.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.620]   He's speaking a body of content.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.220]   He's got stuff to say.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.160]   The gospel, I'm gonna explain that in just a moment.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.720]   But that's the content of what he has to say.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.560]   He is proclaiming the gospel,
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.400]   and he's also helping people
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.540]   with their felt needs in real time.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.640]   He's creating relief for people who are hurting.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.200]   And so he is doing both of these, not one or the other.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.700]   And so you can always count on this.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.980]   Mission for God means speaking and serving
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.320]   all the time, always, and forever,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.180]   right from the example of Christ.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.240]   Mission for God, if you have any interest whatsoever
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.980]   in giving your life to God,
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.480]   mission for God means speaking and serving.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.860]   He said it said he was proclaiming the gospel.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.820]   What does that mean?
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.420]   What is the gospel?
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.920]   What's this thing he was saying?
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.520]   I understand the word gospel is interesting
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.560]   because it can sound a little bit
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.900]   like a religious catch-all word
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.800]   that it means everything and somehow means nothing,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.360]   and you have no clear idea.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.460]   You know, like, what does gospel mean?
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.200]   Isn't it a type of music after all?
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.500]   What does it actually mean when we're saying
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.040]   he's proclaiming the gospel?
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.700]   Here's what it means.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.540]   It means that we're all mid-mission
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.940]   to live for ourselves and not God.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.080]   It means that we've all, to the last human
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.180]   who's ever lived, pushed God away and said,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.880]   "I have my own mission, thank you very much.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.380]   "I'll live in this world that you created on my terms
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.260]   "for myself and for my own ends and not for yours,
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.200]   "thank you, but I'll call you if I need you, bye."
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.960]   That's what sin is.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.860]   That's us separating ourself from God,
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.260]   not because he wanted us to separate,
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.840]   but because we wanted something else.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.880]   And yet God didn't wait for us to turn back to him
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   and say, "God, you know, maybe we really messed up,"
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.540]   'cause we would never have done it.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.820]   Instead, he sent his son Christ, his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.320]   to pursue us as an expression of his love
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.760]   and care and forgiveness.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.020]   Do you see that?
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.660]   So we broke up with God and he pursues us anyway,
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.760]   and at the cross and resurrection of Christ,
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.560]   wins us back to himself.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.800]   That's a beautiful story.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.940]   And it's not just a story,
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.200]   it happens to be the fact of history,
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.500]   and that's the gospel, that's the good news.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.140]   This is what Jesus is going around telling people,
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.340]   that even though people, all of us,
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.080]   I can say down to a person, I know myself,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.540]   and I know this is common with you,
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.140]   that each one of us has pursued our own selves
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.320]   as our own mission,
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.740]   but God has decided to set his love on us
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.980]   instead of his judgment,
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.320]   and he's come for us in the person of Christ
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.380]   to bring us back to himself.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.820]   That is the gospel.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.220]   That's what it is.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.760]   And if you are gonna serve God,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.560]   if you wanna live on mission to any degree,
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.800]   it is going to involve that coming out of your mouth.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.260]   It's going to involve that being shared.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.000]   It's going to involve that being spoken,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.140]   and it must be spoken.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.840]   It's got to be transferred in words.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.720]   You must speak.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   That's part of it.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.480]   But you also must serve.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.720]   This is also what Jesus is doing.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.860]   He says he was healing every disease.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.220]   Now, I know some of you are like, you know what?
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.620]   Does that mean everybody should be a nurse or a doctor?
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.960]   How do I heal every disease?
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.000]   No, that's helping anyway.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.820]   That's not fully healing.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.200]   None of us have the full power of God
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.800]   in our touch the way that Jesus did and does.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.440]   But what we do have is we have the ability in his name
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.200]   and after his example,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.240]   to serve people with their real needs in real time.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.880]   The church for 2,000 years has been known
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.340]   for taking care of people.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.820]   Did you know in the early Roman Empire,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.240]   this is so fascinating to me.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.620]   I don't know, I love history.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.980]   Once I didn't have to go to history class.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.120]   It's never fun when somebody's making you learn it.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.320]   But after the fact,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.360]   it turns out there's some pretty interesting things.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.600]   So in our history, if you name yourself a Christian,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.320]   this is part of your heritage, by the way.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.600]   Did you know that in the Roman Empire,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   in the early days of Christianity,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.500]   that someone was once sent to spy on a group of Christians?
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.300]   Like the emperor sent someone to spy
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.780]   on an early Christian church service
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.040]   and kind of like blend in and be like,
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.880]   okay, what's going on?
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.040]   I don't know, but I'll pretend
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.740]   so I can take notes and report back.
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.920]   All right, so that took place.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.740]   That's a real thing.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.680]   And in the report, this person wrote,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.780]   they sing a hymn.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.760]   They gather early in the morning on Sunday
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.160]   to sing a hymn to Christ as to a God.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.800]   I'm thinking, okay, I hadn't heard a lot yet.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.620]   We do that.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.920]   All right, that's what we do.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:31.000]   And they not only take care of their own poor,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.600]   but ours as well.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.300]   In other words, when someone came to spy
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.880]   on early Christianity, early Christians,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.440]   your forefathers in the faith,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.520]   they found people who were taking care of people.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.520]   They found people who had a humanitarian care
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.680]   at the heart of what they were doing.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.780]   In other words, they weren't just speaking the gospel
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.220]   and saying, okay, we preach for today.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.820]   Great time, we'll see you next week, everybody,
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.760]   'cause we love to preach.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.180]   Yes, we do love to preach.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.060]   No, it was sharing the content
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.900]   and it was also serving the needs of the people.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.560]   It's always been this way and it must go together.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.500]   If we wanna serve in the way Jesus served,
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.000]   if you wanna give your life to his mission to any degree,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.700]   if you want to make your life count,
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.940]   it is going to involve both of those
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.240]   or it's missing half of his heart.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.080]   I mean, think about this.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.800]   What happens if you miss the,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.380]   what happens if you miss the serving component?
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.340]   And you're like, okay, I won't serve people,
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.980]   I'll just talk.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.640]   It will turn you into, as a Christian,
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.220]   just the person who kind of finger points
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.920]   and has a lot to say, but not a lot of love to give, right?
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.780]   That's a problem.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.120]   So we must serve or otherwise people are gonna say,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.260]   well, that's great to hear about,
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.860]   sin and forgiveness and everything,
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.420]   but I guess that doesn't do anything for me today
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.800]   because you certainly don't seem interested
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.560]   in doing anything for me today.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.360]   So we must serve, we must put love into action, you see.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.760]   So if we're gonna share the faith,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.100]   we must also pair with it, we must pair with it service.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.300]   But think about this.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.740]   We also, some people make a different kind of error
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.220]   and they just want to serve, right?
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.340]   And just turn the church into just pure humanitarian relief,
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.680]   but not share that controversial gospel,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.880]   that controversial gospel about sin and salvation
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.760]   and not open that controversial Bible, right?
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.960]   We're just gonna leave that part out.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.220]   And what, you know, this mistake is,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.520]   we'll just leave that part out
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.920]   and we'll come over here and we'll just do actions.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.160]   You know, we'll just do actions.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.500]   And that's such a mistake.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.360]   You know, there's a quote from church history
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.700]   that is very popular and very wrong.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.640]   If anybody's got this tattooed on you, I'm so sorry.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.100]   But we gotta go here.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.240]   The quote is this, "Preach the gospel.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.840]   "If necessary, use words."
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.620]   Some people are like, man, that's deep.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.820]   It's deeply wrong.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.060]   And here's why.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.280]   The gospel always includes words.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.220]   People don't just, it doesn't dawn on people
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.000]   when they see your niceness that Jesus has risen again.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.460]   It doesn't just work that way.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.500]   Some of you actually think, like,
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.200]   that's your mission strategy.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.560]   Some of you like, you show up and you're like,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.540]   you know what, I'm gonna put my,
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.640]   I'm gonna do my work on time.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.240]   And I'm gonna hold that, you know, door for people.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.180]   And then, you know, no one's gonna walk
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.240]   through a door you hold and then be like,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.080]   this must mean that God has saved humanity
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.980]   in the person of Christ.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.660]   No one is gonna connect those dots.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.760]   You have to make it plain.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.320]   That's why Paul said in the scripture,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.260]   I make it plain, which is how I ought to speak.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.600]   So you've gotta make it plain.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.360]   Words must always be involved every single time.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.200]   So speaking and serving and speaking and serving.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.000]   If you wanna get a tattoo, get one that says,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.840]   "Preach the gospel.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   "If necessary, use a translator."
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.340]   All right, so you put that on your body
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.040]   if you need to put something on there, all right?
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.220]   It always involves words.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.380]   Words and actions, words and actions, words and actions.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.720]   Speak and serve if you wanna be like Christ.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.420]   Let's go back to his example.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.180]   Jesus said, "Now when he saw the crowds,"
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.560]   now think about what a crowd would be.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.220]   This is the first century in the Middle East.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.020]   Medicine is not near on the same place
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.100]   at this point in time, 2,000 years ago.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.900]   Modern medicine is not even a distant glimmer in the future.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.660]   People have got major, major, major, major, major needs.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.400]   And when you see this crowd,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.340]   the ones that were following Jesus around,
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.780]   they weren't just looking for the words of God
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.700]   to hear from his mouth.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.740]   They were looking for a miracle in their body, right?
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.220]   From a disease that they could,
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.480]   today would be an afterthought, you know,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.620]   but then was a death sentence.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.720]   And so this crowd is harassed and helpless.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.360]   And in fact, Jesus, as he saw that,
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.220]   he looked at the crowds and there was something in him
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.460]   that was sensitive to it.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.460]   There was something in him that could see it.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.440]   He could see the hurting hearts and minds and bodies
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.900]   and histories and futures.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.580]   And he could see the weight of what it means
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.240]   to live on earth where life is hard and short.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.180]   And to see all of that and perceive
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.440]   that these people have needs.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.080]   And it says, when he saw these crowds,
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.520]   he had compassion for them
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.960]   because they were harassed and helpless
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.480]   like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.920]   That's not arrogance, people.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.160]   Some people are like, you know,
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.860]   when we preach these things in church,
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.520]   they go, "Do you think I'm harassed and helpless?"
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.020]   I'm like, "If you were, would you wanna know?"
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.800]   You know, because Jesus has the ability to look at us
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.840]   and see our inner state, right?
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.140]   He has the ability to see who we really are
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.080]   with compassion.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.680]   So mission for God always means seeing needs.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.440]   If you wanna serve God, you're gonna have to see needs.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.040]   You're gonna have to want to see humanity
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.740]   for where it really is, your people around you,
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.320]   your family, your friends, your coworkers.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.520]   You're gonna have to ask God, if you wanna serve God,
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.980]   if you're available for that tonight,
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.180]   you're gonna have to learn to ask God,
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.260]   can I see these people the way you see these people?
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.520]   Can I see the people around me?
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.760]   Yes, the ones even who frustrate me the most, them.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.320]   I don't know who your them is, but oh my,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.960]   everybody's got a them these days, okay?
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.400]   I don't know who your they are,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.640]   that they're different than you and you don't like them,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.960]   'cause they are the source
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.240]   of all of the problems in the world.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.480]   I don't know who your them is,
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.280]   but you're gonna have to ask God to see them
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.180]   with his eyes and to see what spiritual needs
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.580]   are actually going on.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.640]   Listen, we all have an unpaid 24/7 job
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.280]   of having it together.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.460]   And I just wanna tell you, I don't buy it.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.320]   Not even close.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.520]   A while back, I was in a coffee shop in New York City,
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.760]   and you know you have to take a painfully boring step
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.120]   to start a church,
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.800]   just like starting any other organization.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.600]   You have to write the bylaws.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.100]   Some of you didn't even make it to laws.
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.960]   I said, "By," and you were like, "I'm down."
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.900]   You know, it's super boring,
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.240]   but it's important because you have to do things legally.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.700]   And it actually is an opportunity.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.780]   I just thought, you know what,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.800]   I'm gonna drink a cup of coffee,
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.040]   I'm gonna look on the bright side.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   This is where you get to pour out
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.540]   all your nice, neat ideas.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.080]   It's your church on paper.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.280]   It's the laws of how the church is governed.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.880]   And so when you're starting a church from scratch,
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.720]   I'm like, "I didn't do this.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.220]   "They did this at Watermark in like 1999.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.860]   "I wasn't around, you know, so I didn't have to do,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.060]   "I didn't have to be a part of this."
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.360]   But all of a sudden, I'm like, "You know what?
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.720]   "I'm gonna type out all of the things
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.400]   "that need to happen at the church."
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.200]   And all of a sudden, I'm like,
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.860]   "You gotta do all the legalese, you know,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.340]   "pursuant to the laws of the state of New York
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.500]   "and these United States of America,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.740]   "the church shall blah-di-blah-di-blah."
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.000]   Okay, and so I'm getting something
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.340]   that I'm like pretty proud of.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.040]   I copy and pasted most of it, but that's all right.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.980]   But anyway, I'm getting something
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.940]   that feels like pretty good, all right?
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.280]   And all of a sudden, I look up, I look up,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.320]   I was sitting right at a window.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.020]   I looked up and there's this glass right here,
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.480]   and people are walking down the sidewalk.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.960]   And within half a second of me looking up,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.380]   it was a man and a woman,
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.820]   and within half a second of me looking up,
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.020]   there's a weird turn to this story,
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.860]   just brace for impact.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.820]   He just vomits on the street.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.860]   I know, I'm sorry.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.000]   Anyway, that's what I said.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.820]   I was like, "Dag."
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.040]   All right, so anyway, he vomited right there
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.600]   and as I looked what was going on,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.700]   my heart just broke because they were,
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.440]   the man and the woman were,
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.240]   their eyes were wide open, like glazed over
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.780]   on a total drug high.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.240]   It was so obvious.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.880]   You know, it was just so obvious.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.620]   And he had a towel on his shoulder,
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.760]   like he knew, he knew they were gonna shuffle around
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.220]   the city and go from high to high.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.960]   That's how they spend their time, you know?
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.660]   It was so clear, like that's what they do.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.160]   And as they walked by, I looked back at my computer
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.960]   and I heard this little voice say,
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.560]   "Do you want a church of neat
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.500]   "or do you want a church of needs?
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.700]   "Do you want a church of neat
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.880]   "or do you want a church of needs, really?"
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.440]   Because at the end of the day,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.120]   some of us make it about this far,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.320]   but we don't really wanna do anything
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.440]   if it causes us to be around real roughness,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.280]   you know what I mean?
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.620]   Somebody who's really does not have it together
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.320]   and it's not pretty and it's never gonna be.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.360]   Some of us are like, "You know what?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.280]   "All right, I'm tracking with you.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.220]   "Yeah, speaking and serving, speaking and serving.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.320]   "But what you're really thinking is,
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.800]   "as long as I get to do that for pretty reason,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.500]   "I'm gonna do that for pretty people."
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.700]   That's not the way it works.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.100]   Jesus didn't do that.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.260]   He didn't pick, he wasn't like,
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.040]   "Okay, I'm gonna redeem humanity,
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.540]   "but I need a few things to kind of go my way.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.580]   "So I'm gonna pick a time and a place
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.180]   "where maybe I could accrue some comforts
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.480]   "and be around the desirable of humanity."
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.040]   Well, he didn't do that.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.320]   He went to a place, he was born in an animal area, right?
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.360]   That's the manger story of Christmas, right?
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.480]   He didn't pick what was glorious or glamorous
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.420]   in this world to surround himself with.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.420]   And some of you guys I know are like cool with being apart.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.400]   You'll ride his coattails as long as,
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.720]   you know, you kind of get to rub off
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.240]   on some Christian subculture wave
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.660]   that means you're cool somehow or something.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.660]   It's weird, 'cause he just didn't do that.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.180]   He just served people, took care of people.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.040]   Church has gotta be a place for people with real needs.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.400]   If you have real needs, by the way,
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.320]   and you've reached a place of humility tonight,
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.480]   oh my, you're the healthiest person in the room
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.120]   because you know you have needs
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.780]   and you know Jesus is there for you.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.320]   And you know, by the way, you are the person
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.720]   that he will be able to put to work.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.320]   He'll be the person that he will save by his work
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.700]   and then put you into his work.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.360]   Now, listen, just by way of practical application,
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.300]   I'm not sure somebody's gonna go by your desk tomorrow
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.560]   and just like throw up
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.000]   and then you're gonna be able to share the gospel.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.400]   I don't know that it's gonna go exactly that way,
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.800]   but you know what?
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.980]   They might've thrown up over Labor Day weekend
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.980]   and had time to clean up and shower,
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.880]   but they still feel guilt from whatever lifestyle
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.620]   they're cyclically stuck in, right?
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.280]   You gotta be awake to this.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.480]   If you wanna serve God,
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.920]   you're gonna have to be able to see needs
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.360]   and understand what's going on in this world
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.980]   and what people are really up against.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.160]   When people give you the, I got it together vibe,
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.020]   I don't know that we can buy that with any integrity
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.360]   from a Christian worldview.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.300]   Let's go back to Jesus one more time.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.160]   Then he said to his disciples,
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.240]   there's a problem here he's gonna explain.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.440]   The harvest is plentiful.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.240]   Now this is an agrarian society.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.440]   They grew what they ate, they ate what they grew.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.280]   I'm bad at it.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.120]   I don't live in an agrarian society.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:27.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.080]   They ate what they grew, okay?
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.820]   They grew the food and they ate it, right?
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.720]   An agrarian subsistence society.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.160]   So when he says the harvest is plentiful,
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.020]   any farmer would have been looking out
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.160]   and when the harvest is plentiful,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.800]   you feel this sense of potential.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.460]   It's like, oh, what could be gathered is so good.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.500]   What could be gathered is so good.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.160]   And Jesus is saying, spiritually speaking,
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.000]   humanity is like that.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.040]   What could be gathered is so exciting.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.440]   The potential here is great.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.740]   But the laborers are few.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.020]   Not a lot of people wanna do this.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:58.940]   It's expensive.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.780]   It's hard.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.440]   It's sacrificial.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.020]   People feel like they lose options.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.920]   They can't live for themselves anymore.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.960]   Therefore, here comes the punchline.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.720]   Therefore, pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.900]   because this is God's harvest,
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.900]   not yours, not your pastor's, not mine.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.360]   It's not any of ours, it's God's.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.700]   Pray earnestly to the Lord of these people
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:26.040]   to send out laborers into his harvest.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.640]   I want you to do this.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.680]   I want you to pray, God, will you send people out?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.520]   This is fascinating to me for two reasons.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.420]   First off, Jesus is God,
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.620]   and if he wanted to heal all the crowds
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.360]   with like one wave of the magic wand,
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.620]   he could have done that.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.260]   He could have been like, everybody's fine,
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.760]   and it's over, right?
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.700]   But he decides that his strategy
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.600]   is he's going to enlist normal people
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.900]   to serve and speak to normal people,
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.640]   that he's not gonna do this rescue to people directly.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.900]   He's gonna do it to and through people,
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.480]   that he's gonna use normal people like you and I
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.900]   to reach normal people like you and I.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.240]   That's what he's gonna do.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.020]   And you gotta know the disciples are super unnerved by this.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.040]   This is weird, all right?
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.320]   You're following Jesus around.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.620]   You've seen him do a bunch of miracles,
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.080]   and then a crowd comes and you're like,
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.820]   he's gonna dominate, watch.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.260]   And then Jesus sees the crowd,
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.320]   and it's almost like he goes, wow, that's a lot of need.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   Hey, you guys should really do something.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.160]   You know?
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.360]   And what are they all doing?
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.360]   They're like, wow, look at all these needs.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.600]   You should really do something.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.200]   And he's like, no, no, you should really do something.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.000]   And so Jesus has decided that he will invite regular people.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.200]   I remember feeling so weird in church,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.680]   like, listen, if I ever decided to clean up my act,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.520]   which I'm not sure I ever will,
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.420]   I'm definitely not Jesus's blue chip recruit.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.880]   Let me tell you that.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.220]   I am just not, and I'm not a first-round draft pick.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.060]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.380]   And it turns out, if you have any needs whatsoever,
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.300]   and Jesus captures your heart, yes, you are.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.120]   You can serve him.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.740]   He's reaching people through people.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.100]   That is his strategy.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:58.940]   You are invited.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.680]   All you need is need and availability to be used by him.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.540]   So don't miss the fact that he doesn't look at everybody
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.440]   and go, you know what?
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.280]   Well, I'm glad I'm here.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.580]   Nevermind about the crowd in that place or that country
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.080]   or 100 years later or 100 years from now.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.220]   I'm glad I'm here now.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.660]   Everybody's fine.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.360]   That's not the way he set it up.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.000]   He set it up so that human beings who are in touch with him
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.820]   would contribute to human flourishing,
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.240]   through the gospel and through the meeting
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.140]   of real human needs.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.120]   That's what it means to be on mission.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.680]   That's the first reason I find this exciting.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.860]   The second is the word for send out.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.920]   This is one of my favorite words in the entire Bible.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.760]   I don't wanna shock anybody,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.520]   but the Bible was not written in English.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.700]   This book, the New Testament, was actually written in Greek.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.540]   It's all Greek to you.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.380]   I know, I've heard all the jokes.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.220]   It's all Greek to you.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.080]   But anyway, the New Testament was written in Greek.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.000]   And this word for send out is important.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.760]   I wouldn't tell you about it unless it was important.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.920]   This word for send out is the word ekballo.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.760]   Ekballo.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.560]   You can try it out if you just feel the need to.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.600]   Ekballo.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.560]   All right, you missed your chance
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.400]   if you didn't get it right there.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.520]   All right, we're gonna move on.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.880]   Ekballo is not really just to send out,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.840]   like hopefully, like maybe, like when you get around to it.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.320]   It is to expel or to force out or to drive out.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.900]   Ekballo is the word used a few pages later
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.940]   when Jesus cast out a demon, okay?
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.400]   So Jesus ekballos the demon.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.180]   It's not like, you know, maybe or possibly,
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.900]   or if you could fit it into your calendar.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.460]   It's like right now, okay?
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.100]   So sending ekballo is not like,
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.760]   I'm gonna send something through the mail
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.740]   during the pandemic and maybe it will get there.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.980]   It's not like that.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.500]   This is, it is for sure gonna happen.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.100]   This is like when a spouse offends another spouse
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.740]   and you get ekballo'd to the couch.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.520]   Like you're going, you know?
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.540]   It's like on a ball game.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.660]   If you're watching a baseball game,
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.900]   I'm a baseball fan, got a baseball background.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.740]   It's like when someone gets thrown out of the game
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.900]   and the umpire is like, you, ekballo.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.940]   And like, you can resist, but you are going.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.280]   Like for sure, for sure.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.380]   So ekballo is this concept that it is going to happen.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.860]   It's forceful, right?
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.580]   He's literally saying, so Jesus sees the crowd.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.980]   He sees all these needs and he says,
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.980]   guys, I want you to pray that God will banish people
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.860]   into his mission, that he will get them out of their seats
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.220]   or their slumber or their spiritual boredom
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.620]   and that he will actually move them forward
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.820]   because it will take a miracle to move some people
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.760]   because some people don't want to do this.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.260]   Some people want to be podcast junkies.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.720]   Some people want to associate
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.300]   with never ending conferences and events.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.260]   Some people don't want to actually move
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.660]   and do something to represent the name and fame of Christ.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.400]   And this is why too many churches
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.400]   look like college football games.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.560]   A few people doing a lot of work
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.540]   that desperately need rest.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.540]   And a lot of people watching
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.000]   who desperately need exercise.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.860]   (congregation applauding)
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.260]   Jesus knows our problems.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.660]   He knows what we're gonna do wrong.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.040]   He knows what we're gonna do wrong.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.700]   So he says, listen, this is a matter of prayer
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.940]   because I know you people don't want to get out there
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.780]   and serve people.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.540]   So I want you to pray to God that he will ekballo people
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.260]   and get them going to do something with their lives
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.160]   and stop wasting it week into weekend.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.400]   (congregation applauding)
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.360]   So mission for God means living sent every single time.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.760]   This is why it always has to be more than like,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.240]   oh, you know, I don't know, I turned 27
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.920]   and sounds more mature than 26.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.480]   So I guess I ought to clean it up.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.880]   That's not living sent.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.240]   You gotta be sent by God.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.040]   This is why it's gotta be more than a new year's resolution.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.860]   That's why it's gotta be more
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.240]   than some new self-improvement discipline project.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.320]   Listen, if you want to live for God
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.880]   with any longevity whatsoever,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.220]   you have got to be sent by him.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.440]   Listen, if some of you, if you think your mission,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.280]   if you think what God wants from you
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.120]   is to come to church 2.5 times a month and curse less,
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.360]   you have not been sent on a mighty mission.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.080]   Although I can't advocate for you doing the mission
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.900]   while cursing a lot.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.080]   That would be confusing, all right?
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.480]   But the point of life is not to tidy up
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   in some minutiae related way, right?
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.600]   But to give glory to God with everything that you do
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.060]   and to be sent in a mission that will echo into eternity.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.880]   And some of us I know think,
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.720]   "Oh, that's for somebody else."
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.200]   And I assure you, it is for you.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.320]   You are invited.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.240]   If you're available tonight
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.720]   and you're not already mid-mission to live for yourself
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.320]   and you're available,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.120]   Jesus will send you on the ride of your life.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.880]   I don't know how I became a Christian, a pastor.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.120]   I certainly don't know how I moved everything I own
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   in a U-Haul to New York City
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.640]   to try to start of all things a church.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.160]   I can tell you with the utmost certainty,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.240]   I don't know how I got here
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.160]   other than simply saying, "God, I am available.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.600]   "I just wanna be available to do your bidding.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.440]   "That's all I want.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.640]   "I just wanna do your bidding."
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.140]   (congregation applauding)
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.520]   I don't know what adventure,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.280]   I don't know where Jesus would send you.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.240]   There's a lot of countries in the world.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.600]   There's a lot of cities in the world.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.560]   There's also a lot of coworkers at your current space.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.060]   May not send you anywhere except to work tomorrow.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.080]   I don't know where he's gonna send you.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.920]   I just don't want you to miss it.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.200]   I don't want you to miss it from the boredom
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.720]   of your repetition plan
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.320]   that you know is already not giving you life.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.960]   I'll close with this idea.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   You've gotta be resilient.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.320]   If you wanna live on mission for Christ, for God,
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.240]   you wanna live for something more,
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.080]   you don't wanna waste your life.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.560]   Maybe I made a dent somehow by the Spirit of God tonight
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.760]   and you don't want to live for yourself any longer.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.400]   Listen, I wanna warn you up front,
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   you need some resilience.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.320]   You need to be able to stick with it
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.480]   because you will be resisted.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.400]   I just wanna be honest.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.080]   I don't wanna come in here and throw a pep rally
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.900]   and everybody's fired up
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.240]   and then I'm not gonna act like the scripture
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.160]   also doesn't talk about our suffering in this mission.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   This is a challenge, people.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.000]   This is really tough.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.400]   I was on my way to church.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.640]   We were doing a little preview service about a year ago
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.120]   because we officially launched here in a week and a half.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.180]   But about a year ago, I was on my way
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.960]   to do a little preview service in downtown Brooklyn
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.060]   and they had these rental mopeds
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.240]   that are really great to get around.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.160]   So I decided to rent one of those
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.960]   and I started to go to church
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.200]   and about halfway there, I just stopped at a red light
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.520]   and I looked up and all of a sudden,
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.480]   a guy's standing in front of the bike,
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.000]   really weirdly close and really randomly angry
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.880]   and I'm like, "Oh no, I don't know what this is."
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.960]   And so I start to just drive around him.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.200]   He shoves me off the bike.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.920]   It clatters to the ground behind me.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.000]   And I turn around.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.120]   Listen, I'm just gonna tell you people,
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.720]   I'm a preacher, I'm a talker, I'm not a fighter.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.080]   All right, so I turn around.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.640]   I'm like, "Hey, we're gonna talk about this."
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.280]   So I turned around.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.880]   I had my AirPods playing underneath the helmet.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.700]   I don't know if that's safe.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.720]   But anyway, I had music going.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.340]   So anyway, I'm trying to get into the vibe.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.180]   I'm going to church.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.100]   So I like stopped my AirPods
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.020]   and by the time I turned around,
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.660]   hit a right hook, like hit me right in the chin.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.500]   And just, and here's the thing,
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.180]   at the end of the day, that was the only hit.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.620]   So it wasn't that bad.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.100]   But in that moment, you don't know where it's gonna stop.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.940]   You really don't.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.220]   It's just a strange, a really strange moment.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.220]   And all of a sudden, I think he decided the moped
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.500]   was more important than the fight.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.900]   He got on the moped, he drove off
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.180]   and the police came after him
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.900]   and I just walked to church and preached the sermon.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.780]   You know why?
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.540]   Because my mouth still worked
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.420]   and because it's not the end of the world.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.740]   And listen, I just want to tell you,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.340]   that's the, that's, oh, please don't clap
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.540]   because it's so small compared to what people go through.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.900]   I'm sorry, I know some of you are trying to encourage me.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.720]   Thank you.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.060]   But listen, that's so small.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.700]   I know, I know a pastor in New York City
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.700]   who almost had his life taken in a scenario like that.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.200]   It's, what, that is so small.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.180]   That's a painfully mundane illustration.
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.580]   But I just want to tell you, people go through real things.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.940]   You ask Christians in other parts of the world.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.180]   Christian suffering is not another,
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.820]   it's not just another century.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.420]   It's another place at times, right now.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.820]   This is not a game, all right?
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.380]   And listen, some of you have a,
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.700]   are gonna leave this building with a plan to do good
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.580]   and a plan to do well and the world's gonna resist you.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.500]   Listen, in the words of the great theologian, Mike Tyson,
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.380]   everybody has a plan until they get hit in the mouth.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.700]   All right, so listen, some of you are gonna,
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.860]   some of you are gonna leave here with a plan.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.700]   You're like, I am going to give my life to God.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.900]   No, I'm for real, for real this time.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.740]   And I just want to tell you,
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.140]   the whole world might not clap for you,
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.420]   but God will and the church will
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.100]   and you stay encouraged, all right?
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.780]   Nobody ever said this was gonna be easy.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.700]   This is not a game, all right?
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.540]   But it is a chance to lift up the fame
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.220]   of the only person whose name will outlast all of our names.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.480]   That's the name of Jesus.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.960]   Let's pray.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:14.660]   Jesus, thank you for showing us how to love people,
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.540]   how to care.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.360]   Thank you for snapping us out of our dead routine.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.980]   Thank you for inviting us to something
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.300]   that is so much better than the life
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.820]   we could create for ourselves.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:30.020]   Thank you that in you is life and life abundant.
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.540]   Thank you that in you is forgiveness
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.460]   for a thousand wasted evenings.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.480]   Thank you that in you is peace
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.380]   for a thousand fearful thoughts.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.460]   And thank you that in you is the only future
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.080]   that is going to satisfy to any degree.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.640]   And thank you, Jesus, that your mission was to rescue us
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.380]   so that you don't need us to get out of here
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.060]   and do stuff for you to love us.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.260]   But you already love us,
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.700]   and our mission comes from an overflow
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.660]   of our connection to you.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.760]   Our mission comes from an overflow
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.740]   of a connection with you.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.320]   We don't have to try to live on mission
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.260]   so that you'll love us.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.360]   We live on mission because you already do.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.500]   Father, I pray for freedom.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.860]   I feel the potential of the people around me.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:16.100]   And Father, I know, I know that you are able,
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.020]   only you, I know I can convince no one,
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.000]   but you are able to move people
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.660]   from living for themselves to living for you.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.260]   And I pray that you would do that miracle in mass
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.460]   for these people in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:37.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
