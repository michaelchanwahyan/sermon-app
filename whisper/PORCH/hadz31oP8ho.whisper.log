[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - We recently moved into a rent house
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.380]   about a mile north of here, my family and I.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.660]   And it's always interesting getting to know
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.220]   a new neighborhood, getting to know new neighbors
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.060]   and whatnot.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.820]   And so as I would take the trash out
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.860]   through the garage in the back,
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.820]   there's a house across the alley
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.900]   and there's a large eight foot fence there
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.600]   and it's a newer home or a larger home.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.540]   And every time I go back there,
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.040]   no matter what time it is, it's like,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.280]   (imitates thumping)
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.940]   And so like I went down out at 9 a.m.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.640]   I'm like taking the trash,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.320]   the, what do you call it, the dumpster kind of back there.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.880]   And it's like, (imitates thumping)
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.820]   And then I went back out at 11.30 p.m.
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.860]   (imitates thumping)
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.300]   And like these guys are partying all the time, man.
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.920]   And so I didn't really say anything.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.220]   I didn't think much of it.
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.860]   And then a couple of weeks go by
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.600]   and Monica's like, "Hey, have you ever noticed
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.300]   "that the house behind us is like constantly partying?
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.940]   "Like they have a nonstop party going on back there."
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.640]   And I was like, "I know it.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.540]   "I thought the exact same thing."
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.780]   And so every single day I would go out there
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.580]   and there's just, (imitates thumping)
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.420]   And there's this party.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.420]   And so I can, there's a fence,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.520]   but I can see what's happening.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.020]   Like there's people splashing around.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.320]   I'll hear a conversation.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320]   They evidently have some sort of swing set.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.720]   And so I see like my mind, yeah, 'cause that's fun.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.360]   My mind is like painting the picture.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.220]   I see the margarita machine.
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.460]   You know, I see the people.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.500]   They're kind of walking around.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.560]   Everybody's partying.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.940]   And then I hear that they have a teenage daughter.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.400]   And I'm like, "Oh man, they need to reign that girl in.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.580]   "Like she is like nonstop pool party in the backyard."
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.040]   And so we kind of continue to joke about this.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.420]   Like, "Hey, what's up with the party?"
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.180]   Like it's like this kind of running joke in our house
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.580]   that they have this nonstop party going on
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.860]   from sunup to sundown all the time.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.160]   We're kind of sad we didn't get invited and whatnot.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.900]   And so Monica walks out to the back one day
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.520]   through the garage.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.540]   And the guy who owns the house, the dad is out.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.260]   And he goes, "Hey, you must be the new neighbors."
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.100]   And she said, "Yeah, we moved in a little over a month ago."
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.140]   And he's like, "Oh, it's so great to meet you."
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.340]   And he goes, "Let me just start by apologizing
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.880]   "for the loud music."
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.120]   And she goes, "Oh, you know, it's cool.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.940]   "You know, we like music.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.780]   "It's all good."
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.620]   And he said, "My 15-year-old daughter has Down syndrome.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.060]   "And she sits out back all day and it soothes her."
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.060]   And in a moment, the scene changed.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.140]   Like what was actually happening behind the fence changed.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.520]   I couldn't see past the fence.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.660]   I couldn't see over there.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.500]   And so what I did is I stayed over there,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.360]   over here in my safe little place,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.340]   in my little community, in my house.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.580]   And I made judgment calls about what was happening
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.440]   on the other side of the fence.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.440]   And I painted a reality there that was not a reality at all.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.020]   In fact, there was a very, very different reality
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.520]   that was happening back there.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.460]   And I think on the topic of homosexuality,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.180]   this has happened by both parties.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.680]   Those in the homosexual lifestyle,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   in homosexual communities, look at the church
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.400]   and make judgment calls of what's happening.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.280]   And moreover, those in the church,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.960]   look at those in that lifestyle.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.040]   And though they can't see past the fence,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.620]   though they won't engage into their world,
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.700]   they make judgment calls
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.920]   of what's actually happening back there.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.120]   And so tonight, what I hope to do,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.480]   what I hope the Holy Spirit does here
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.780]   as we bring down the fence,
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.540]   I hope we can see how the Lord wants us to love
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.840]   people not like us.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.560]   And I hope that they would see our efforts
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   and desire to love as Jesus would call us to love.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.300]   As we move through the scriptures,
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.000]   I want you to know something up front.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.460]   You're going to hear things
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.260]   that you will certainly agree with.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.520]   And most of you here tonight will hear things
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.620]   that you certainly don't agree with.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.880]   I'm gonna ask you for something.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.420]   I've noticed that we come to this topic
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.660]   with preconceived notions and preconceived ideas
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.960]   and agendas, and I just want a disarmament
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.060]   to happen right here.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.440]   Would you set down your weapon?
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.280]   Would you set down your weapon and would you listen?
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.980]   And would you let the Holy Spirit instruct your heart?
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.400]   I pray that anything that I say that is not of God,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.660]   you don't even hear.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.520]   But anything that I say that is consistent
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.480]   with God's character and the scriptures,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.200]   that it moves in your heart and it does indeed change us.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.840]   And if you're here and you identify as gay,
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.360]   I imagine that as you hear this,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.440]   you're like, dude, you don't even understand,
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.200]   to which I want to say, I am sure that I don't.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.700]   But I wanna make a commitment to you.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.920]   If you will listen to me for the next few minutes,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.040]   if you will hang out, if you will not get up
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.640]   and leave, if you will not assume how it ends,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.920]   if you will, I know that you have a message of love as well,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.320]   if you will give me that love and respect,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.360]   then I will take as long as it takes
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.560]   to meet with every single one of you
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.600]   until you help me understand.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.220]   I, let me say that again, I will sit down with each of you.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.640]   And I will listen with no agenda other than to listen to you
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.320]   so that you might help me understand,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.800]   so that I might grow an understanding of where you're at,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.560]   how you feel, how the church has potentially hurt you,
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.240]   or whatever it is that you would like to share, deal?
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.160]   The other day I shared the gospel with a friend,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.360]   someone that the Lord had placed in my life,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.040]   and he responded in a way that I did not anticipate,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.800]   I didn't see it coming, he said, I believe in Jesus,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.560]   I just don't believe that gay people are going to hell.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.600]   And I said, well, I don't believe gay people
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.480]   are going to hell either.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.040]   And he said, to hell you don't.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.320]   I said, oh, well, tell me more of what I believe, bro,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.640]   like that's interesting, like clearly you're a prophet.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.360]   What is it exactly that I believe?
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.640]   And he goes, I know that the church believes
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   that gay people are going to hell,
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.520]   and I said, well, it's interesting, I work at a church,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.600]   and I believe that everyone's going to hell,
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.760]   except for those that have acknowledged the payment
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.840]   so that they can be with God forever,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   those who have acknowledged that God sent
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.200]   his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for their sins
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.560]   so that they can be given new life,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.200]   life with him forever and ever in eternity.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.000]   That's the gospel, that's the very gospel
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I just shared with you, now how do you hear in that gospel
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.040]   that homosexuals are going to hell, how did you hear that
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.200]   in what I just shared with you?
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.280]   And we began to talk, but I understand how the church
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.480]   has been misunderstood and even misspoke,
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.080]   not just misunderstood, but miscommunicated on this topic.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.360]   We have cliches that are stupid, and we say things like,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.320]   you know, God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   and that's not helpful.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.960]   We say, hey, love the sinner, but hate the sin.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.360]   But if you go out there, there's all kinds of instruction
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.600]   on how to hate the sin, but very little instruction
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.160]   on how to love the sinner.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.840]   And so what are we doing tonight to love
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.320]   and to move past these ideas?
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.520]   There's a real tension for me tonight
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.680]   as I feel a burden to shepherd the church
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.560]   toward caring for those who identify as homosexual,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.680]   as well as to care and to love for the person
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.280]   who identifies as homosexual.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.800]   There's a tension there, it's very, very difficult to do.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.400]   And so I understand why this is the topic
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.040]   that has torn the church apart, that's what they say.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.320]   They say, hey, this is the topic that is going to cause
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.600]   the church to lose its voice, and I believe they're right.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.880]   That probably is how this will play out,
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.640]   unless we figure this tension out,
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.200]   unless we figure how to navigate through this
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.320]   carefully and cautiously.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.840]   So would you pray for me?
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.240]   Would you pray that the Lord would speak through me?
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.720]   And would you pray that Dallas is shaped
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.800]   through this message?
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.680]   We're in a series called Lyrics and Lies,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.520]   we're looking at Macklemore's "Same Love" tonight,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.200]   and I'll read to you the first part of the song.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.680]   When I was in the third grade, I thought I was gay
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.120]   'cause I could draw, my uncle was,
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.200]   and I kept my room straight.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.560]   I told my mom, tears rushing down my face,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.240]   she's like, Ben, you've loved girls since before pre-K.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.840]   Yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.840]   Bunch of stereotypes all in my head,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.720]   I remember doing the math, like, yeah,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.960]   I'm good at Little League, a preconceived idea
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.840]   of what it all meant for those that liked the same sex.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.440]   Had the characteristics, the right-wing conservatives
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.200]   thinks it's a decision, and you can be cured
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.360]   with some treatment and religion.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.760]   Man-made rewiring of a predisposition playing God,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.360]   oh, no, here we go.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.680]   America the brave still fears what we don't know,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.760]   and God loves all his children is somehow forgotten,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.160]   but we paraphrase a book written 3,500 years ago,
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.720]   And I will tell you that Macklemore as a heterosexual
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.280]   does an incredible job of bringing down the fence
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.280]   and allowing us as the church to see into this struggle.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.720]   He gives us a mirror as the church,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.440]   and he says, hey, this is what you're doing.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.320]   He does an incredible job of allowing us
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.480]   to look past the fence, that's what he does well.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.160]   And so tonight what I hope to cover
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.720]   is what the Bible actually does say about this topic,
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.080]   where we as Christians have missed it,
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.920]   and then before you leave here tonight,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.960]   the change that is necessary.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.080]   One that might surprise you, one that might not.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.520]   And so we'll start with what does the Bible actually say,
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.160]   and what does it mean?
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.600]   This is gonna carry throughout the message,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.520]   it won't be contained in this point
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   as we'll continue to cover
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.920]   what the scripture says on the topic.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.200]   But I will tell you that if the Bible
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.480]   is not authoritative in your life,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.440]   you at least wanna listen to be educated,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.680]   you can at least build your case
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.640]   against what the scripture says.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.800]   Even if you don't trust it, even if you don't believe it,
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.320]   it is important that we all understand what the Bible says.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.760]   This is a topic where you have to know where you stand,
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.200]   because if you don't know where you stand,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.320]   you will be misrepresented by both sides.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.800]   That is why this message is so important.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.360]   And so we know that if you have studied the scriptures,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.480]   that early in Genesis 19,
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.640]   you see a condemnation of homosexuality
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.600]   in what's going on in Sodom,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.640]   where we actually get the word sodomy.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.600]   This is before the law came out.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.360]   This is the Old Testament.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.720]   And so we see that, some say,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.920]   well, the sin of Sodom was actually
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.640]   that they didn't care for the poor.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.680]   That's true, that's one of the sins of Sodom,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.160]   but the sin that Sodom is most known for
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.000]   is actually this act of homosexuality,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.320]   otherwise known as sodomy,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.640]   where we get that name from the very town.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.840]   And so then the Old Testament law comes in Leviticus 18.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.400]   And so bear with me, 'cause I'm going Old Testament on you.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.240]   Leviticus 18, verse 22, it says,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.960]   "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.200]   "It is an abomination."
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.560]   And then again, in Leviticus 20, verse 13, it says,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.520]   "If a man lies with a male as with a woman,
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.680]   "both of them have committed an abomination.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.480]   "They shall surely be put to death.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.520]   "And when they be put to death, their blood is upon them."
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.640]   And the argument against this looks something like this.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.760]   Well, if you believe in the Old Testament law,
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.640]   then why do you eat shellfish?
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.160]   Why do you eat pork?
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.400]   And why do you get a bald fade
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.600]   like the one I'm representing right now?
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.880]   Why do you shave the side of your heads?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.600]   Because all of that is Old Testament law,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.080]   and they're absolutely right.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.960]   We do not obey the Old Testament law anymore.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.600]   Jesus came and he abolished the law.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.040]   That's what the scripture tells us.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.560]   It's a really sound argument, or at least half of it,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.880]   where it comes from, the argument that it makes is true.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.200]   Romans 10, verse four, it says,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.280]   "Christ is the culmination or end of,"
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.800]   that's what that word means,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.160]   "Christ is the end of the law,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.040]   "so that there may be righteousness
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.440]   "for everyone who believes."
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   Now, there is the moral law that shows up
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.680]   in the New Testament, which the Spirit guides us through.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.040]   The moral law is things like don't kill, don't steal,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.840]   don't marry your father and mother,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.240]   don't commit adultery, things around sexuality.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.920]   This law reappears throughout the New Testament.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.600]   This is what marks the follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.800]   that his Spirit, the law that is now written on our hearts,
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.120]   that he would live that law out in our lives.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.920]   And so homosexuality actually shows up
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.080]   in the New Testament in Romans one,
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.800]   in 1 Timothy one, verses nine through 11,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.000]   and in 1 Corinthians six,
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.640]   be for the rest of our time this evening.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.600]   But I want you to see a verse, it's John one, verse 17.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.360]   It says, "For the law was given through Moses.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.820]   "Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.360]   The law, that which we looked at in Leviticus,
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.600]   which we certainly do not obey,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.840]   we're not putting people to death,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.360]   and we're not saying, "Hey, you can't go eat at Red Lobster."
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.560]   Not sure why you'd want to, but you shouldn't.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.520]   You can if you want to.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.240]   "For the law was given through Moses.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.960]   "Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.560]   If we have missed this, if you have missed this,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.060]   let me make this personal, if I have missed this,
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.700]   if I have missed out on the topic of homosexuality,
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.620]   if I have misled, if I have mistaught,
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.960]   if I have misinterpreted,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.760]   it has been in one of these two areas, grace or truth.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.720]   Jesus came and brought grace and truth.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.840]   And some of you are here, and you're like,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.720]   "Truth, man, I love truth."
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.560]   And you're preaching truth, and some of you are here,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.940]   and you hear grace, and you're like,
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.400]   "Oh yeah, grace," and you're preaching grace,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.320]   but both of them are absolutely necessary.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.520]   Grace and truth, full of grace, full of truth,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.900]   that those two would be complete and exist together.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.760]   Not one or the other, but both of them coexisting.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.720]   And so what we've done is we've taken grace,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.300]   and we've changed the definition
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.600]   to something called tolerance.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:59.080]   We've taken grace, and we've moved it to tolerance.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.520]   Saying, "Well, if I'm to be full of grace,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.420]   "then I'm to tolerate sin.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.100]   "I'm to love everyone and ask no one to change,
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.440]   "because that would be unloving."
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.780]   And we've taken truth,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.660]   and we've redefined it to judgment.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.780]   And we say, "Well, the Bible says that I'm to speak truth,
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.520]   "and so that allows me to bring judgment to everyone.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.480]   "I can just go around and kind of determine
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.700]   "the fruit in people's life, and I can judge them,
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.940]   "and I can call out their sin, but there's no grace."
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.060]   It has to be both full of grace and full of truth.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.100]   It's not tolerance for sin in the name of love,
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.140]   which is not love, and call that grace.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.440]   Not judgment of sin outside the church,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.880]   and losing your voice.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.200]   We're not called to judge sin outside the church.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.700]   We're called to judge sin inside the church.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   We're called to treat those outside the church
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.540]   by sharing the truth of the gospel.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.640]   And so we point those outside the church
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.320]   to the grace of the gospel,
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.040]   and we point those inside the church
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.160]   to the truth of the Bible.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.320]   Let me say that again.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.100]   We point those outside the church
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.460]   to the grace of the gospel.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.100]   That's the truth that we share
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.140]   with those outside the church.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.660]   Did you know that Jesus loves you so much
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.220]   that he gave his entire life
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.820]   for everything wrong you've done
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.940]   so that you can be with God forever?
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.260]   And we take those inside the church,
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.540]   those who have trusted in Christ's death and resurrection,
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.380]   we say, "Hey, do you know what the scripture says
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.220]   "and how you might live your life,
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.740]   "that the Holy Spirit would conform your life
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.640]   "according to the scripture?"
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.460]   Macklemore says, "But we paraphrase a book
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.180]   "written 3,500 years ago."
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.300]   And so Macklemore is not just asking you
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.060]   to accept homosexuality.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.220]   He's building a case against the Bible.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.700]   He is essentially saying it's old and you can't trust it.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.540]   And this is where I take issue with what Macklemore says.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.500]   You cannot trust the Bible.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.940]   And so Macklemore has forsaken books written 1,900 years ago,
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.780]   LBN 1, 1 Corinthians 6, verses nine through 11.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.540]   To set this up, homosexuality was more normal
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.080]   than monogamous heterosexuality in this culture.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.780]   The culture that this was written into,
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.260]   homosexuality was the absolute norm.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.220]   In fact, 14 out of the first 15 emperors of Rome
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.260]   all had homosexual relationships.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.580]   Let me say that again.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.540]   14 of the first 15 emperors of Rome,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.300]   all of them, 14 out of 15, had homosexual relationships.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.100]   That is the culture that this is being written into.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:35.100]   But as we look at this text, I want you to find your sin.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.980]   There's a list of sins here.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.100]   I want you to find yours.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.360]   Do you not know that wrongdoers, that's all of us,
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.540]   everyone here has done wrong,
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.500]   wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.900]   That's really bad news
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.380]   'cause we wanna inherit the kingdom of God
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.120]   and we've all done wrong.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.720]   So he must be trying to make a point here
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.900]   that's bigger than what it says right here.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.180]   Do you not know that wrongdoers
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.660]   will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.100]   Do not be deceived.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.440]   Neither the sexually immoral, that's absolutely me,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.020]   I've been sexually immoral.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.480]   Okay, there's lots of sexual immorality in my past.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.500]   There are days still today where I struggle with lust,
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.640]   which is sexual immorality, according to Jesus.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.180]   Nor idolaters, that's the sin that I would circle for myself.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.860]   I am very quick to bring idols before God.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.700]   I am very quick to have something that I love in my life
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.660]   more than God in moments of my life.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.860]   I'm an idolater.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.720]   I struggle with idolatry.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.520]   Nor adulterers, nor men who have sex with men.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.880]   Now there's two words here
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.400]   that the NIV 2011 has interpreted
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.000]   as men who have sex with men.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.600]   There's a lot of debate around these two words,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.280]   two words in the Greek.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.920]   One of them, it is a, if you are one sex,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.400]   but you identify more as the other sex.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.360]   So if you're like an effeminate male,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.560]   that would be the first word.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.500]   And the second word translates men who penetrate men.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.040]   I know that's graphic,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   but that is how the word is translated
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.680]   as it is used in ancient Greek.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.760]   So you have effeminate male and men who penetrate men.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.840]   These are the two words.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.020]   The second one is absolutely bulletproof.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.280]   There's no redefining it.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.800]   There's no misunderstanding it.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.240]   That's what it means in every ancient Greek text
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.080]   that we look at.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.040]   That's what it means.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.400]   It is a word that encompasses all of homosexuality.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.120]   In fact, both passive homosexuality
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.360]   and active homosexuality.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.240]   Both the feeling and the action, if you will.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.200]   They're both represented here in these two words.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.120]   And then it goes on to say,
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.120]   nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards,
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.480]   nor slanderers, nor swindlers
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.840]   will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.720]   It's bad news.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.800]   If you stop there, it's really easy to understand
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.000]   how the church has missed it,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.640]   saying stupid things like if you're gay,
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.480]   you're going to hell.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.320]   That's not true.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.120]   And it's a bad interpretation of this text.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.040]   It is a misunderstanding of this text.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.720]   The context of this text is all throughout,
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.640]   prior to that chapter in 1 Corinthians 6.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.280]   And in 1 Corinthians chapter five,
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.000]   at the end of that chapter, verse 12,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.360]   it tells us really clearly,
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.520]   what business is it of mine, Paul writes,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.680]   to judge those outside the church?
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.400]   Are you not to judge those inside?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.960]   Paul says, the context of this passage
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.720]   is those who are within the church
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.560]   should judge those within the church.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.800]   But those who are within the church
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.200]   should not judge those who are outside the church.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   If they do not ascribe to, hey, the Bible is absolute truth
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.360]   and authoritative in my life,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.040]   then why would they ever say,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.560]   I'm going to live according to it?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.880]   Some of you get so frustrated with those in your life
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.680]   that you work with that sin,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.520]   but they haven't signed up to not sin
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.600]   or to follow the Holy Spirit
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   because they don't have the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.880]   And that's foolish, that is a waste of frustration.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:03.640]   And so the truth, again, as we cover what the Bible says,
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.240]   is that homosexuality is a sin,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.000]   but it is a sin just like yours,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.200]   just like my idolatry.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.080]   In fact, if you're here
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.760]   and you're sleeping with someone outside of marriage,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.920]   you are just as much in an offense to God
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.680]   as the one who struggles with homosexuality
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.800]   or the one who has given themselves to homosexuality.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.720]   Do you understand that?
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.880]   You're just as much in offense to God as that one.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.120]   And so the church must stop treating this sin
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.240]   like it's a special kind of sin,
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.160]   like it's some sort of unique sin,
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.000]   and understand that it is just like
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.040]   all of the sins of heterosexuality,
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.640]   just like the sins that I said that I struggled with.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.240]   And so what Jesus did is he took the law
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.800]   and he raised the bar.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.520]   The law said, don't kill.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.240]   I say, if you treat someone poorly, you've committed murder.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.320]   The law said, do not commit sexual immorality.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   I say, if you look at someone lustfully,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.240]   you're not married to, you've committed adultery.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.680]   Do you see how Jesus takes the bar and he raises it?
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.160]   And he's saying, hey, you can't keep the law.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.080]   Why would God give us the law if we can't keep the law?
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.120]   The law does three things.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.960]   I'll just say a few things, okay?
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.240]   The one thing that the law does
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   is it shows our deep, incredible need for a savior.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.480]   God, I can't even do right.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.960]   I need someone to save me from my sin.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   See, also Jesus Christ, the law protects us
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.920]   from that which would bring harm to us.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.160]   God says, I love you, I've created you,
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.840]   and if you follow this law, it will lead to life,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   life in me, and it shows us a way that we should live.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.080]   And so we share the truth that it is a sin,
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.440]   but we share that out of love, not out of law,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.040]   not from the law, but from love.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.320]   And because the moral law is consistent
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.560]   with the character of God, when we break it,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.840]   we bring harm to ourselves.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.480]   That's the way God created the world.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.720]   That's the way that he wired the world.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.960]   And so I am well aware of, like when I sit here
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.280]   and I've gotten lots of angry emails
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.840]   and lots of angry phone calls from guys
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.200]   whose girlfriend broke up with them,
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.720]   'cause I'm sitting up here and I'm like,
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.840]   hey, you shouldn't be having sex.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.880]   You know, we're sitting next to each other
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.480]   and it's super awkward, and I see the elbows sometimes
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.360]   and the tears sometimes from up here.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.640]   I mean, you should see the view from up here.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.520]   And so I get those emails,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.480]   because whenever you start removing someone's idol,
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.160]   and they say, well, you don't understand how I feel.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.680]   You don't know, I really, really wanna be
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.160]   in this relationship, but I talk to a girl
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.960]   who's in a physical relationship, and I say,
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.040]   hey, y'all need to break up,
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.320]   you need to give each other some space,
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.160]   and you both need to pursue Jesus separately,
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.440]   and he might bring you back together, he might not.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.520]   And I see the tears, and I say, oh, man.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.800]   I mean, I have gotten hate letters in that.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.760]   When you start bringing down someone idols,
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.880]   but God has given us instruction,
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.080]   and that instruction is meant to lead us to life
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.200]   because God loves us.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.320]   And so when we don't listen, it goes poorly.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.680]   And so how does this apply to the issue of homosexuality?
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.600]   I'm gonna read to you some statistics.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.400]   I want you to pay close attention to where they're from.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.880]   These are not from Christianity Today,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.400]   or watermark.org, or the porchdallas.com.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.200]   These are from the American Public Health Association,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.840]   from the CDC, from the Oxford Journal of Epidemiology.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.920]   I will read them.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.880]   Those who identify as homosexuals are 150% more likely
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.280]   to deal with depression, anxiety, and alcohol,
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.320]   or substance abuse.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.360]   That comes from the American Public Health Association
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.080]   in 2013.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.600]   The homosexual lifestyle includes
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.040]   a 200% higher rate of suicide.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.520]   That comes from the American Public Health Association
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.080]   in 2013.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.800]   And so the argument there is, well, that's because
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.000]   we live in a world that doesn't accept us.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.720]   And so therefore, we wanna leave that world,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.840]   and we're more prone to depression.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.080]   And so they did a study.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.440]   That study was done in the Netherlands,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.160]   where the gay lifestyle is completely accepted,
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.200]   just as it was the heterosexual lifestyle.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.600]   And what they have found is that there are higher rates
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.720]   of depression, bipolar, panic disorder, OCD,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.760]   psychiatric disorders, among those who identify themselves
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.440]   as homosexual in the Netherlands.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.960]   And so let's talk about disease for a minute.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   I wanna remind you right now that I'm sharing this
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.800]   out of love.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.040]   My heart, my motive is love.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.280]   And showing the danger of a specific activity
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.520]   as it relates to homosexuality.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.640]   Disease, the 2005 Oxford Journal of Epidemiology found
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.940]   that 78% of homosexuals have at least one STD.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.060]   The US Center for Disease Control in 2013 found,
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.360]   while only 3% of USA, America's population identifies
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.520]   as being homosexual, this group is responsible for,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.500]   so this group of 3% is responsible for 50% of cases
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.180]   of syphilis, 60% of cases of gonorrhea,
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.840]   90% of homosexual men report chronic
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.780]   or recurrent viral infections.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.700]   Over 75% of all HIV cases, so 3/4 of all HIV cases
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.180]   in the last five years are among the homosexual community.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.020]   Why?
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.940]   Because we weren't created to do that.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.820]   And whenever we go against God's law,
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.760]   there are consequences.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.680]   Whenever we pursue feelings over that which he has commanded
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.840]   it is harmful to us.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.760]   Did you know that AIDS, when it came out in 1982,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.380]   was called GRID, Gay-Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome?
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.720]   That was the initial name for AIDS
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.280]   because they found the disease only existed,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.980]   to the best of their research at the time,
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.680]   in these clusters of community
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.920]   that identified as homosexual.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.080]   Later, the name, in the '80s, the name was changed to AIDS.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.520]   Now, life expectancy.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.580]   According to the 2005 Oxford Journal of Epidemiology
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.500]   and the American Obituary Report,
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.500]   in homosexual, the age expectancy is 20 years shorter
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.700]   than their heterosexual counterparts.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.280]   Only 1% of homosexual men die from old age.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.160]   And some of this is because the rampant promiscuity
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.500]   in the homosexual lifestyle.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.220]   Swedish gay male couple, David and Andrew Madison,
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.640]   did a study in the Journal of Sex Research.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.180]   They studied 2,583 couples.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.740]   Not a single couple sustained a monogamous relationship
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.300]   despite being openly married.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.580]   Average number of partners was between 101 and 500.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.140]   Male couples who identify as gay
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.940]   are 50% more likely to divorce,
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.820]   and couples who identify as lesbians
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.440]   are 167% more likely to divorce.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   And so you understand why there is a truth
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.680]   that we share because we love our brother and sister,
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.160]   not because we think they're weird,
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.800]   not because we think they're crazy,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.300]   but because we love them and we desire life for them.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.980]   And God says, "Hey, this is where life is found."
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.200]   Now, I wanna ask you a question.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.440]   If you have a friend, someone you love very, very much,
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.400]   and they say, "Hey, I wanna take this pill.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.960]   "I wanna swallow this pill."
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.660]   And you say, "Well, what will the pill do for you?"
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.420]   And they say, "Well, once I take it,
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.320]   "I'll be more likely to be anxious,
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.980]   "more likely to be depressed,
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.840]   "more likely to commit suicide,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.700]   "more likely to get sick more often,
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.240]   "more likely to be promiscuous, more likely to divorce,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.340]   "and I'm going to take two decades, 20 years off my life."
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.100]   (congregation murmurs)
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.860]   What is the loving response?
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.380]   I would tell you it depends.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.020]   It depends if they're inside the church,
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.940]   you show them to the truth of the Scriptures.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.280]   This is what the Bible says.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.380]   If they're outside the church,
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.180]   you show them to the truth of the Bible,
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.020]   and you say, "You know what?
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.660]   "If you trust in this, you can live forever.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.660]   "You don't have to cut off 20 years of your life.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.740]   "If you trust that Jesus Christ has paid
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.920]   "for all the things you've done,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.420]   "there's no shame in the kingdom.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.260]   "You can live with God forever and ever and ever,
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.360]   "and 200, 2,000, 2 billion years from now,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.380]   "you'll still be with him.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.720]   "I'll be with you too.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.820]   "We'll be together up there forever."
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.300]   There is forgiveness, man.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.580]   You point those inside the church
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.620]   to the truth of the Scripture.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.120]   You point those outside the church
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   to the grace of the gospel.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:22.220]   And you do it consistently.
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:28.700]   Over and over and over, you do that.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.620]   I had a friend tell me,
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:35.980]   he says, you know, he's not a believer, he's an atheist.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.480]   He said, "I love people just the way they are.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.900]   "I don't want anyone to change.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.280]   "And what happens when they're unhappy
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.220]   "is I don't know what to do."
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.580]   And so he was like sending people to me to meet with.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.580]   And I said, "Why are you sending these people to me
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.420]   "to meet with them?"
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.820]   "Because you love them enough to call them to more.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.580]   "I can only love them right where they're at.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.480]   "You know, this is the way I'm wired.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.560]   "I just want everybody to be happy.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.780]   "I don't really want any awkward conversations.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.780]   "But you love them enough to show them what could be.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.640]   "You love them better than I do."
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.760]   Jesus took all the laws, over 600 of them,
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.520]   and he summarized them into two commands,
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.720]   love God and love people.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.520]   He says, "In these, all of the laws are encompassed.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.480]   "And so the compassion in you might say right now,
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.060]   "but JP, I'm born that way.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.340]   "They're born that way."
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.880]   Among the scientific community,
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.380]   there is no supported evidence that people are born gay.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.880]   I don't know if you knew that.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.660]   But I would tell you that I have a strong inclination
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.180]   to think that there probably are born
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.740]   with a predisposition to be gay,
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.020]   or the possibility for it anyways.
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.660]   Rick Warren was in a recent interview,
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.820]   or it was in an interview,
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.100]   I don't know how recent it was,
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.900]   and the angry reporter said,
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.340]   "Would you believe that homosexuality is still a sin
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.500]   "if they found the gay gene,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.900]   "if they found that people were born gay?"
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.880]   To which Rick Warren said, "Absolutely.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.800]   "I would still say that it's a sin."
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.300]   And she said, she was really upset,
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.140]   and she said, "Why?
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.420]   "How can you say that?"
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.860]   And he looks at her and he goes,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.200]   "Because I want to have sex
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.240]   "with every beautiful woman I meet."
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.160]   But no one would argue that that's what's best for society.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.100]   But that is what I want.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.700]   That is my strong inclination.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.220]   That is my strong feelings.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.780]   That is my desire.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.460]   But no one would argue that that's
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.900]   what is best for everyone.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:41.040]   And so I think that we're born on a gender spectrum.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.820]   Some of us are born more masculine males than others.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.980]   Some of us are born more feminine females than others,
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.820]   and there's a spectrum.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.460]   And I believe that amongst that spectrum,
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.620]   as we kind of move across it, there is confusion.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.500]   I believe that there are things that can happen to you
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.740]   at an early age, early exposure to sex
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.980]   that can cause further confusion.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.820]   I believe that men, you know,
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.220]   might be more attracted to men than women.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.820]   And as they move through adolescence,
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.160]   and as their body starts to produce hormones
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.380]   at 600%, the normal rate,
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.820]   and that is when we actually bond.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.620]   Because nobody's attracted to anybody, you know,
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.620]   when they're in the second grade.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.100]   Like right now, I've got little ones,
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.620]   and little girls, and boys just have cooties, you know?
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.220]   And so nobody's attracted to the opposite sex
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.500]   at a super early age.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.100]   It happens at some point.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.460]   But when we move through adolescence,
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.780]   our bodies begin to bond, and specifically for males,
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.660]   as we begin to experience the release
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.600]   of some sort of orgasm, our brain creates synapse
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.340]   that could bond us to the same sex,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.740]   if that is what is more mysterious to us.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.940]   Because before that, girls aren't beautiful,
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.540]   they're just kind of mysterious.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.480]   And so our bodies begin to bond to something.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.740]   I believe that's a great explanation for this.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.500]   That comes from Ricky Shillette,
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.620]   who struggled much of his life with homosexuality himself.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.460]   You can go for more information on that,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.740]   go to livehope.org.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.020]   I hope that you will, if you're here,
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.660]   and you identify as gay,
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.980]   or you struggle with homosexuality,
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.220]   that you would check out livehope.org,
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.060]   Ricky Shillette's ministry.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.560]   Now for girls, it's different.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.080]   For girls, it comes from an emotional attachment,
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.940]   almost always some sort of codependency,
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.580]   some sort of really close friendship,
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.020]   which crosses the line and turns physical.
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.260]   And when it turns physical, it's confusing,
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.980]   you're convinced that you're lesbian,
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.280]   or bisexual, or whatever that is,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.340]   and you continue to act out.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.420]   Very similar, almost always,
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.100]   in almost in every single case,
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.900]   the same sex parent is either absent,
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.700]   or neglected, or confused,
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.460]   or doesn't identify well with you.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.260]   And so I believe that there is cases
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.540]   of both nature and nurture,
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.380]   that both of those are in play
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.840]   to cause someone to live out the homosexual lifestyle.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.900]   I had a friend I sat with,
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.420]   I sit with people who identify as gay,
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.340]   or struggle with homosexuality often.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.780]   And I had a friend, and I just said,
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.540]   "Hey, when did you notice that this was your deal?"
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:12.240]   And he said, "JP, when you're in the locker room,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.380]   "you can't control how your body responds."
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.540]   And I was just hit with compassion by that.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.020]   I was like, "What a great explanation.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.460]   "When you're a dude in a locker room
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.760]   "with a bunch of naked dudes,
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.300]   "and your body responds, that's a..."
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.820]   I would certainly think,
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.620]   "Hey, this is my natural predisposition,
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.500]   "this is the way that God made me."
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.580]   And that's a feeling.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:38.080]   But what you do with that feeling is up to you.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.000]   That's the action that comes from that feeling.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.140]   I don't deny the feeling, not for one second,
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.740]   I believe that it's real.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.900]   But I believe with the feeling, you have a responsibility.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.460]   I have lots of feelings,
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.940]   and I'm not even trying to relate to the gay community.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.500]   I'm just saying I have lots of feelings
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.180]   that I have to take captive and not act out on.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.160]   And so I will tell you that your identity, friends,
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.400]   is so much more than your sexual orientation.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.980]   Your identity is so much more than your sexual orientation.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.820]   Verse 11, this is where we get hope.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:20.620]   "Idolaters, men who have sex with men,
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.520]   "the sexually immoral drunkards."
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.860]   And that is what some of you were.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.180]   But you were washed, you were sanctified,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.260]   and you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:36.940]   and by the Spirit of our God, He changed you.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.780]   And so my third and final point
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.820]   is the change that is necessary.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.220]   There are three kinds of changes
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.260]   that I believe are necessary.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:48.180]   The first one is that Christians must change our approach.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.060]   We must change our approach and point people to Jesus,
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.040]   and share Jesus with non-believers.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.460]   Not try to make them not gay,
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.920]   but try to show them the hope that they have in the gospel,
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.180]   that with believers we would point them to the truth.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.240]   And I know it is a very scary reality for some of you
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.100]   that you might be celibate the rest of your life.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.340]   But I know also that there are a lot of women
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.140]   in the room right now that are faced
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.720]   with that same real reality, that same fear.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.200]   And it's not godly.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.640]   It's ungodly.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.860]   You can trust Him, He has a plan for you.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.820]   And you're not gonna get to the end of this race,
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.220]   and get up there and be like,
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.380]   "God, I was celibate, what's up with that?"
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.460]   You know, you're not gonna be like,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.780]   "I missed out on sex."
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.580]   It's going to be okay.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.540]   My buddy, the guy in the locker room,
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.300]   said, "I don't think I will ever be attracted to women.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.980]   "But I love Jesus, and I understand the scriptures,
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.040]   "so I'm committed to celibacy.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.020]   "I will never have sex.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.020]   "I will die, and I won't know what that's like."
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:57.020]   That's okay, I have older, single female friends
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.620]   who'd say, "You know what, I may not have sex.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.000]   "I may die, I may leave this earth, I may get to heaven,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.140]   "having never had sex."
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.860]   It's going to be okay, we're all almost there anyways.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.300]   Life is so short, man.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.700]   And I know you're thinking, "Well, easy for you to say.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.620]   "I get it, I understand."
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.460]   I'm just telling you, that's their testimony.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.700]   We'll be in heaven soon.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.980]   I have a hunch that you're gonna get up there,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.820]   and he's gonna have a reward for you
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.100]   that's going to make it so worth it.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.660]   It's gonna be so worth it, man.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.620]   And even if you've given into that,
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.100]   Macklemore says this,
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.580]   and I can't change, in the chorus, she sings,
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.500]   "Even if I tried, even if I wanted to,
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.220]   "my love, she keeps me warm, she keeps me warm,
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.140]   "she keeps me warm, she keeps me warm."
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.160]   If you're here and you're attracted to the same sex,
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.780]   I want you to know Macklemore's right.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.100]   You can't change.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.980]   But my God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.140]   is God of miracles.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.380]   He can do anything.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.780]   He can do anything, he can certainly change you.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.220]   And that's the second thing, the change that's necessary.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.780]   The people who struggle with homosexuality
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.020]   must understand that change is possible.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.180]   I see this all the time, at least once a month.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.820]   I had a friend who acted out all through college,
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.900]   was very much in the gay lifestyle,
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.820]   very much in multiple gay relationships,
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.300]   never thought that he would not be gay,
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.700]   went through a recovery ministry here,
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.220]   was told by many of his gay friends,
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.700]   "Hey, they're just trying to change you,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.180]   "that's not loving, that's unloving."
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.700]   Married a girl on our staff,
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.980]   they have a little girl now named Hope,
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.140]   because he said, "There's hope."
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.500]   That's his message for you, there's hope.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.020]   Have another friend who I prayed for long ago,
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.860]   it was actually a friend of mine's sister,
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.860]   we were in a Bible study together,
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.860]   he said, "Hey, pray for my sister,
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.100]   "she's in the same sex relationship."
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.380]   We prayed as a Bible study,
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.740]   I never heard anything else about it
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.660]   until I saw her name again as someone
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.260]   we were hiring on staff at Watermark.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.100]   I went to her and I said, "I prayed for you years ago."
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.340]   She goes, "I'm married now."
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.540]   I said, "But you were in the same sex."
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.940]   She goes, "Yeah, I was.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.860]   "I'm married now, she's today pregnant."
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.740]   God can change people for sure,
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.300]   but for you, he might not.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.260]   Man, you may have this struggle for the rest of your life,
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.780]   you may continue to be attracted to the same sex
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.740]   for the rest of your life,
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.500]   that may absolutely be the reality that you live in.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.220]   And I want you to know something,
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.780]   that when your identity is so wrapped up
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.980]   in your sexuality or your sexual orientation,
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.540]   someone asking you to change is absolutely offensive.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.380]   It is confrontational.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.660]   If your identity is your sexuality
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.540]   and someone's saying, "Hey, you need to change."
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.420]   You're like, "How can I change who I am?"
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.660]   But I want you to know
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.260]   that I'm not trying to make you not gay
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.780]   or even tell you that you're not gay.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.780]   I'm trying to tell you that you are so much more than gay,
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.180]   that God loves you,
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.420]   that your identity is in Christ who died for you,
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.220]   and there's no shame in the kingdom.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.540]   And you sit there and some of you,
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.220]   you're not out of the closet,
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.060]   and you're like, "There's things that have happened to me
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.980]   "in my life that I'm gonna take to the grave."
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.980]   And I know you're here,
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.580]   and I want you to know
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.940]   that there is no shame in the kingdom.
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.620]   All of those things were disastrously displayed on the cross
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.540]   for the world to see.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.620]   They went on Jesus.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.340]   Everything that happened in private
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.860]   went on him in the public square
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.460]   as he breathed his last breath for you.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.860]   And change is possible.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.220]   He died for it.
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.180]   In fact, following Christ means change.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.460]   Sanctification means change, and we all want change.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.180]   That's why we make New Year's resolutions.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.060]   That's why self-help books are the best sellers
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.860]   year after year after year.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.980]   Everybody wants change.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.780]   The most despairing message in the world
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.020]   is you can't change.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.580]   But God can change you.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.020]   It's what he does.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.660]   He's really, really good at it.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.820]   And that is what some of you were,
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.020]   but you were washed, you were sanctified,
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.580]   you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.020]   by the spirit of our God.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.300]   I was a sex addict, a pornographer,
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.860]   a pervert, I was a pervert.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.700]   If you knew where my mind was,
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.460]   you wouldn't let me preach up here.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.300]   But God washed me.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.740]   He is sanctifying me.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.700]   He justified me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.700]   and by the spirit of our God.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.020]   And Macklemore says, "The right-wing conservatives
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.300]   "think it's a decision.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.220]   "I don't think how you feel is a decision.
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.140]   "I think what you do with those feelings is a decision."
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:42:00.900]   I know men who feel attracted to eight-year-old boys.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.620]   And I believe that feeling is absolutely real.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.300]   But I would not tell them to act out on it
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.340]   because they feel it.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.380]   I would tell them to take that thought captive
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.940]   and to conform it to the image and the character of Christ.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.020]   And I know that we've made this a civil rights issue
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.180]   as of late, and I want you to know
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.620]   that race is not a feeling.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.540]   I have felt African-American most of my life.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:30.740]   And it doesn't, it doesn't make me black.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.540]   Race is sacred.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.740]   Race is determined by God.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.140]   Sex is also sacred.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.940]   He invented it.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.620]   And so the Bible condemns racism.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.580]   That's why at the center of most civil rights movements
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.460]   was Christians, people who knew the Bible.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.500]   But I'm telling you that you choose who you have sex with.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.020]   And if you have sex in a way that is different
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.700]   than God's design, it's wrong and it's harmful.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.940]   And I haven't spent any time talking about God's design
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.220]   because I think it's pretty obvious,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.940]   but you can imagine God made Adam.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.580]   He looked down and said, "What's that?
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.660]   "And what's it for?"
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.700]   And then God made woman.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.660]   And he said, "Oh, that's what that's for."
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.180]   And I know it's kind of funny,
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.540]   but I just wanna go logical with you for a second,
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.540]   that her body changes and moves and accommodates that
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:35.340]   in a way that brings forth life.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.860]   This is God's incredible design.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.500]   It is beautiful and fascinating.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.660]   But if you do with that instrument other things,
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.180]   you bring harm to your life.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.180]   And that is why a God who loves you says, "Don't.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:54.740]   "Even if you feel like it, don't, because I love you."
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:00.860]   And I know it's a hot topic for government
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.860]   and I won't spend a lot of time here,
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.100]   but I would tell you that a government
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.020]   should always govern us toward what is best for society.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.500]   And so if you are pro-redefining marriage,
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.500]   then you believe that what is best for society
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.580]   is for a child to have two mommies or two daddies.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.580]   If you believe that,
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.620]   you're certainly entitled to that belief.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:25.500]   But there's another change that needs to happen.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.300]   It's a change in our society, that's the third one.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.260]   Because Paul writes that this particular struggle
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:36.220]   is a sign of God's judgment on mankind.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:41.540]   That it is evidence that we do what we feel like,
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.180]   regardless of what he says.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.460]   Romans 1, verse 25 to 27 says,
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.020]   "They exchanged the truth about God for a lie
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.100]   "and worshiped and served created things
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.020]   "rather than the creator who is forever praised, amen."
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.540]   They exchanged the truth of God for a lie.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:00.420]   That which God says is wrong, they said, "It's not wrong."
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.100]   They took a truth and they said,
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.940]   "Hey, here's a lie and we'll hold onto that."
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.300]   God says, "Hey, this is wrong."
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.260]   They said, "Now it's not wrong."
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.100]   Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.260]   Even their women exchanged natural relations
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.420]   for unnatural ones.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.060]   In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.980]   with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.500]   Men committed shameful acts with other men
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.420]   and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.900]   And I want you to know there's no shame in the kingdom
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.740]   that God forgives.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.540]   He says, "I've removed your transgressions
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.140]   "as far as the east is from the west,
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.220]   "an impossible distance.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.220]   "I have covered them with the very blood of my son, Jesus,
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.380]   "because I love you."
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:48.620]   It's interesting that we are,
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.820]   our culture's really heating up on this topic
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.660]   and we're like a frog in water being boiled
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.820]   and not fully aware.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.380]   When I first heard the song, "Same Love," she says,
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.940]   "It's a woman saying, 'She keeps me warm, she keeps me warm.'"
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.780]   And that was weird to me.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.620]   It was interesting to me.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.900]   That woman was saying, "She keeps me warm."
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.380]   And it was like, wow, that just doesn't sit right with me.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.900]   But Macklemore's been incredibly successful
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.820]   because when I hear it today, it's not weird.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.660]   I've been conditioned.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.380]   I'm like, oh, there's nothing weird about that.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.620]   That's totally normal.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.060]   That's completely right and I don't think anything of it.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.580]   And I want you to know something, friends.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.420]   I'm not a bigot.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.500]   I've never hated someone because they were gay.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.220]   More often, I feel hated because I call it a sin,
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.780]   just like my sin.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.140]   I feel like Macklemore hates me, if I'm honest.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.940]   And if you're here and you've been given over to that sin,
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.100]   I want you to know that God loves you
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.300]   and He's not mad at you.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.780]   And I believe that in your heart,
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.260]   you know that it's not right, that it's unnatural,
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.700]   even though it feels natural to you.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.780]   If you're here and you struggle well,
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.020]   I want you to know I'm so proud of you.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.260]   I have a feeling that the Lord has something
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.820]   really special stored up for you
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.820]   that's available to all of you,
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.180]   special for all of you.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:16.140]   And if you're here and you're a heterosexual Christian,
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:20.180]   I want to ask you, how have you loved on the gay community?
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.300]   Not just hated the sin,
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.340]   but how have you loved the sinner around you?
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.660]   How have you gone to lunch and brought down the fence
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.020]   and said, hey, I want to enter into your world?
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.300]   I'm gonna end tonight by inviting up my friend,
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.540]   John Burnie, who is just going to share
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.860]   for a moment with you his story.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.940]   If you would, welcome John to the stage.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.380]   (congregation applauding)
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   - Like I said, my name is John Burnie
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.580]   and the PORCH team asked me to share a little bit
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.700]   of my story this evening.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.220]   And I knew that if I didn't write it down,
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.900]   I'd be so nervous to share it.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.980]   I was so nervous this year that I'd forget my name.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.220]   So bear with me.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.260]   One of my very first memories growing up
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.460]   is standing against a brick wall
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.820]   and an older neighborhood boy lining two of us up
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.300]   to be chosen for a sexual encounter
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.340]   and not being the one chosen.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.980]   Later on, he would go on to abuse me.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.500]   But some of the deepest hurt that came from that encounter
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.700]   was that it introduced a lie that I was not chosen.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.380]   I remember feeling shame not only for the act,
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.500]   but also for desiring it and desiring to be chosen.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.580]   I started to have homosexual fantasies shortly after that,
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.540]   starting about the age of six,
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.340]   and really remember lying about those thoughts
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.220]   from that age on.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.740]   In junior high, I started to physically lust
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.540]   over the male physique and seek out pornography,
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.120]   which continued to grow through high school.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.380]   By the end of high school,
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.580]   I remember coming to the realization
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.260]   that these desires were not something
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.940]   I was just going to outgrow.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.200]   They were following me.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.900]   In college, I acted out physically
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.000]   and felt guilt, shame, and alone, completely isolated.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.620]   I felt that if I told the truth,
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.060]   my whole world would crumble.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.660]   After college, I moved to Dallas,
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.660]   and our family had some turmoil
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.420]   that uncovered some family secrets.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.300]   It was at this point in my life that I remember thinking,
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.660]   oh, I can go through my whole life
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.900]   and never tell the truth,
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.140]   and even still, at some point,
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.020]   it's going to be revealed and it's going to be hurtful.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.100]   So I decided to go to regeneration
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.580]   and Watermarks Recovery Program
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.860]   in hope of telling the truth.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.460]   To be honest, three years ago,
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.260]   when I started regeneration,
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.220]   I could not even say what I am sharing with you today
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.620]   by myself in front of a mirror.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.820]   My life was ruled by fear,
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.300]   and now, three years later, by the grace of God,
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.820]   I am here with the opportunity
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.360]   to share God's story in my life.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.980]   I think that a big shift in thinking for me
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.100]   is knowing that my testimony is not about what I've done,
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.260]   but about what Christ has done for me,
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.860]   and through this, I have a new life.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.300]   I'm not sharing my story,
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.940]   but the grace of God at work in my own life.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:07.100]   2 Corinthians 5:17 says,
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.340]   "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.820]   "The old is passed away; behold, the new is come."
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.140]   At regeneration, I was introduced to that verse,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.460]   which is a promise that the things I struggle with
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.140]   don't define who I am.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.180]   It is Christ who defines who I am.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.900]   How does that look for me today?
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.340]   It's not that I'm perfect or don't struggle,
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.620]   or that lust isn't something that isn't there,
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.820]   but really living life,
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.500]   trusting that God is making me new, like his word promises.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.040]   Romans 12, one and two says,
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.080]   "Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy,
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.140]   "to offer your bodies as living sacrifices,
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.880]   "holy and pleasing to God.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.040]   "This is your spiritual act of worship.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.020]   "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world,
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.700]   "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.380]   "Then you will be able to test and approve
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.800]   "what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will."
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.740]   I am learning that the renewing of my mind
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.460]   is only brought about by a daily,
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.640]   abiding relationship with God,
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.980]   asking him to renew my mind.
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.100]   Community and surrounding myself with other men
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.160]   who are pursuing Christ, who know who I am,
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.780]   and know what I struggle with, has been huge.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:17.380]   We share each other's burdens and hold each other accountable
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.260]   and I've seen fruit from it,
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.880]   like being able to share my testimony with my little sister
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.120]   and say this in front of you all.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.960]   These are things that were unimaginable to me.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.860]   I thought I always would have to hide.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:34.140]   It is only by the grace of God that I can say today
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:38.300]   that I am fully known and I am not rejected, but accepted.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.780]   I have been shown mercy and love.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:41.620]   Thanks.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.780]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.780]   (audience cheering)
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:52:10.740]   - I don't know what it's like to sit there for an hour
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   while someone is talking about your struggle.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.500]   When you don't see it as a struggle,
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.460]   maybe you see it as a gift, I don't know what it's like.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.900]   But I know where life is found and I found life myself
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.580]   in the same place where John has found life.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.540]   If you're here and you identify as gay, I love you.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.780]   God loves you even more than I do or could.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.100]   He has an amazing life for you.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.460]   He has a kingdom stored up for you
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.460]   and the battle will be hard, the battle will be real.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.300]   The struggle will be difficult.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.220]   I've seen people jump on the road and jump off the road
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.620]   and jump back on the road and it's a very similar path
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.120]   that I have ventured down myself with pornography.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.380]   But I know where life is found.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.560]   So whether you're in Dallas or Fort Worth
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.500]   or listening in around the country,
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.980]   I want you to know that God is crazy about you.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:17.500]   He's shown that through displaying the gospel.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.340]   His son, Jesus Christ, your sin going on him,
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.560]   him going in the grave, him coming out of the grave,
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.480]   promising you that you can live forever with God.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.860]   That is the hope that we have.
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.340]   I pray that you have it in common.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.340]   When you trust in that, he deposits his spirit in you
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.460]   as a helper to sanctify you and what that spirit does
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:40.140]   in the lives of all of us is he changes us.
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:45.060]   He makes us, he takes us from being dead to life.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:49.380]   And I have heard stories like John's over and over
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.140]   and over and over and over again
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.440]   and I will never get tired of hearing them,
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.260]   both in girls' lives, in men's life,
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.400]   in several of your lives.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.740]   And I'm grateful for that message of change.
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.980]   We can't change.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.820]   But he changes us.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.660]   Let me pray.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:19.500]   Father, help us as the church to be full of grace and truth.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:24.340]   Father, in your supernatural abilities,
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.220]   will you take those who feel shame right now
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.460]   and will you remind them that you love them?
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.700]   Will you remind them that your grace is sufficient,
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:38.500]   that your power is made perfect in our weakness?
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.660]   And Father, will you equip your church,
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:44.620]   your bride, the church, to love those in our paths
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:48.140]   and to call the church to truth
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.740]   and those outside the church to the gospel?
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.340]   Thank you for the gospel, Lord.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.360]   Thank you for how you love us.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.720]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:03.440]   I had a friend just tell me like,
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.340]   she's like, "I get it, man.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.180]   "I was raised in the church.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.080]   "I know it's a sin.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.220]   "I don't know that you need to cover that."
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.500]   And I don't think you get it.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.700]   Everyone has something to do when they leave here.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.220]   We all are responsible for bringing down this fence.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.580]   We all must move toward someone in our lives
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.620]   to show them and display God's love,
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.240]   not to make them not gay,
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.140]   but to tell them that they've been made new
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.260]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.260]   Oh, how he loves you.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.620]   Some of you need to hear that desperately right now.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.660]   God is crazy about you.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.060]   He's not mad at you for what you did last night,
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.860]   for there's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.540]   and he's no longer counting your sins against you
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.060]   if you've trusted in Christ.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.000]   And some of you,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.020]   some of you need to feel the weight of that condemnation
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.540]   so that you might move to a place
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.460]   where there's not any in Christ,
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.500]   that you would trust that 2014 years ago,
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.780]   God loved you so much that he sent his son to this earth
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.900]   to live a perfect life and to die a perfect death
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.480]   specifically and especially for you.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.540]   In a moment, if you're here
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.820]   and you're looking for community,
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.580]   there's gonna be guys that gather in this room
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.980]   right down this hallway that would love to talk with you.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.140]   And if you're a girl, there's girls in this hallway
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.380]   that would love to talk with you.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.500]   They're also looking for other Christians
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.820]   to go through life with.
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.780]   There's gonna be a lot of people up here
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.060]   that would love to pray for you if you're here
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.940]   and your struggle is homosexuality
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:38.940]   or you identify as gay, I'd love to meet you.
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.220]   And also, if you just wanna come up,
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:43.100]   I don't want people to feel like that's the only reason
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:43.940]   that you have to come up here.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.340]   If we can pray for you about anything,
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.560]   whatever's going on in your life,
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.660]   maybe something else resonated with you.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.900]   If you have more questions
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.780]   or wanna talk about other topics
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.700]   that we didn't cover tonight in regards to this,
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.340]   we would love to talk with you also.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.620]   And I'll keep my commitment that I made to you
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.940]   on the front end.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.620]   I'd love to meet with you.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.700]   I love you guys.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.700]   Go in peace, to love and serve the Lord.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.860]   (silence)
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
