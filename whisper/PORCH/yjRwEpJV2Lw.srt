 [Music]

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 You carried my burdens and hung on that tree

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 With every breath You thought of me

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Without Your mercy where would I be?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Where would I be without You?

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 All of my sorrows were met with Your grief

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 In suffering and dying You gave me the keys

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Without Your cross where would I be?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Where would I be without You?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Hallelujah, You came to set me free

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 The story isn't over, it's only just begun

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You've written every word in perfect love

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Hallelujah, sing hallelujah

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Sing hallelujah

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 You silenced the curse of my enemies

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And rose up in power, my King of all kings

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Without Your victory where would I be?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Where would I be without You?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Hallelujah, You came to set me free

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 The story isn't over, it's only just begun

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 You've written every word in perfect love

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Hallelujah, sing hallelujah

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Sing hallelujah

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I was an orphan left on the street

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Died of beating, broken and weak

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 You knew my history, all of my sin

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 With open arms You welcomed me in

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I was an orphan left on the street

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Died of beating, broken and weak

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 You knew my history, all of my sin

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 With open arms You welcomed me in

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Hallelujah, You came to set me free

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 The story isn't over, it's only just begun

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 You've written every word in perfect love

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Hallelujah, sing hallelujah

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I was an orphan left on the street

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Tattered and beaten, broken and weak

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You knew my history, all of my sin

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 With open arms You welcomed me in

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Oh, You welcomed me in

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Yes You did Lord

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Cause I was lost and opened

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 But You welcomed me in

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 There's nowhere I could go from this feeling

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 You welcomed me in

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Hallelujah, sing hallelujah
