[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.360]   - All right, well, hey, let's go.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.360]   Welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.840]   friends in Houston, Texas,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.720]   Northwest Arkansas, in Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.680]   Cincinnati, Ohio, Tulsa, Scottsdale, Arizona,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.840]   Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wherever you're joining us.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.500]   And for the very first time tonight,
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200]   North Houston at Champions Four,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.120]   so Porch Live North Houston.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.260]   We are kicking a series off, Hot Take Summer,
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.920]   where we are gonna look at some hot takes from God's word.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.360]   A hot take is something that, you know,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.000]   you throw out there that you would say,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.140]   man, I'm just spitting facts,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.320]   but there's a lot of people that may have,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.600]   see it as a hot take,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.280]   as though it's not the consensus of the world
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.000]   or of maybe even most people.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.040]   Let me give a couple of hot takes
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.320]   that I would say are for me personally.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.960]   Hot take, Michael Jordan is without question,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.460]   undeniably, uncontroversially, that's not a word,
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.700]   the greatest basketball player of all time.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.680]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.920]   Hot take number two, McDonald's is delicious.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160]   I don't care what you say, it's amazing.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.720]   And if you're saying, ooh,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.320]   it's, you knew that you could lose weight
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.640]   and eat there every meal, you would eat there, fact.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.440]   Hot take, this one's gonna sting a little bit,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.240]   cheerleading is not a sport, okay?
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.120]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.120]   Just saying, that's in my Bible.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.880]   Hot take, a meal without meat is not a meal that is a snack.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.520]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.880]   Man, okay, hot take, iced coffee
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.520]   is the only way to drink coffee.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.640]   Man, these are not hot takes at all, so at home.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.520]   Hot take, the show "Friends" is overrated.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.760]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.600]   Wow.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.900]   Good night, everybody.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.160]   Man, you guys on another level tonight.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.520]   Hot take, a Whataburger is better than In-N-Out.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.280]   Hot take, Texas is, in fact,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.080]   sorry everyone tuning in from everywhere else,
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.640]   the greatest state in America.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.440]   And hot take, some of you don't come to the porch
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.160]   to hear about Jesus, you come to look for a spouse.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.080]   Just call it like it is, all right?
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.040]   Tonight, we are gonna look at another hot take,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.200]   and it's one of the more unusual topics that we have covered,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.320]   but God's Word talks about it,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   and we think it's appropriate and an important one,
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.820]   especially as we kick off summer, and that is this.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.720]   Hot take, modest isn't hottest, but it's better.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.240]   Hot take, modest isn't hottest, but it's better.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.920]   If you grew up like me in church,
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.080]   or you grew up around the church,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.160]   you may have heard phrases,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.480]   or even honestly outside of the church,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.340]   where people are like in an environment
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.000]   where it's a co-ed pool party, junior high,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.340]   mom comes up, "Remember, ladies, modest is hottest."
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.160]   Or you were at a youth group event, summer camp someday,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.920]   and somebody came up, and their wardrobe was like,
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.260]   "And let's all remember, modest is hottest."
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.480]   In the back of your mind, everybody went,
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.080]   "No, it's not, no, no, no, it's definitely not."
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.760]   And that's because it's not.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.080]   In other words, modesty, and dressing modestly,
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.320]   is not always as hot, if you will,
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.000]   especially in terms of how culture uses it,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.560]   and anybody who says that it is,
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   is just kind of kidding themselves, but it is better.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.800]   And so we're gonna look at what God's Word
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.320]   has to say about this subject,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.520]   because it's a really important one,
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.840]   and can't wait, it's a topic that,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.240]   there are so many different mixed messages that come,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.560]   in so many ways, that I think, even as Christians,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.200]   our thinking has been impacted and influenced
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.960]   more by what the world says,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.100]   as it relates to how you dress,
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.020]   as it relates to the way that you look,
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.220]   as it relates to what's okay and what's not,
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.720]   that are robbing some of us
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   of who Christ is calling us to be.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.080]   I think the topic tonight is directly related, candidly,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   to who some of you are gonna marry,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.340]   because you're gonna get this right.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.780]   And as you're gonna see, it matters a lot,
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.000]   and it is directly connected
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.080]   to the type of relationship that you have,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000]   the type of person you're gonna end up marrying.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   So we're gonna look at why modest,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.300]   although it may not be hottest, it is better.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.440]   But first, I'm gonna set up, hey, even what modesty is.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.040]   So as it relates to modest is hottest,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.520]   oh, this was my favorite meme that I saw this week,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.360]   that captures maybe the only guy
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.160]   who thinks modest is hottest, and it's this meme.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.880]   It's just one of those, like, boom, oh man, that's hot, woo!
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.560]   See that ankle.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.840]   Other than this guy, and maybe your grandma,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.880]   modest definitely is not hottest, but it is better.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.940]   But first, we gotta unpack what is modesty,
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.800]   and I wanna unpack first what it isn't.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.640]   What modesty isn't, just before we dive in,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.340]   then we're gonna look at three reasons why it's better.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.360]   Three myths about modesty.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.840]   Number one, it's simply a woman's problem.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.200]   It's just not true.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.440]   Some of the most unaware people,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.800]   as it relates to being immodest, and how they dress,
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.900]   and what they're doing with their body,
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.120]   and just what they post, are often guys.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.480]   It's not that it's not a woman's problem,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.320]   it's all of our problems,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.240]   it's something that the Bible commands all of us
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.920]   to be about, but it's not just a woman's problem.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   That's myth number one.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.680]   Myth number two, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.480]   Doesn't matter what I wear, I can wear whatever I want.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.520]   That's true, unless you are a follower of Christ.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.640]   Because as we're gonna see, it's a really big deal to God,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.800]   that he cares a lot about your heart,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.460]   and he cares about how that heart leads you to dress.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.280]   Myth number three, being modest is about being a prude.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.960]   The truth is that no, it's not.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.280]   God is all about sex.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.200]   He's all about immodesty,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.720]   and an appropriate boundary called marriage.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.600]   Where the two are naked, without shame, altogether.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.800]   That God is not a prude, God's not against sex,
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.040]   he's all about sex, he invented sex.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.840]   We did an entire series called Rated R for Romance,
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.040]   one of my favorite series we did.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.280]   It was on the book of Song of Solomon.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   Song of Solomon was a book that was so scandalous,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.500]   that until you were 30 years old,
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.420]   Jewish boys could not read it,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.080]   because of the sexual content, think about that.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.920]   In other words, they were sneaking in
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   to read some of the Bible as a young boy, as a teenager,
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.640]   hoping to not get caught with a lamp,
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   and like, oh my gosh, I can't believe this.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.440]   That's Song of Solomon, God's all about it.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.000]   In Proverbs chapter five, it says this,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   "Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.840]   It's talking about sex.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.320]   "Rejoice in the wife of your youth, she's a loving dear.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.480]   "Let her breasts always satisfy you.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.920]   "May you always be intoxicated or captivated by your love."
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.520]   God is all about amazing sex.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.040]   In the context of marriage.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.760]   It's not because he's approved.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.060]   Myth number four, modesty is about your clothes.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.680]   As we're gonna see, modesty is about your heart.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.800]   In 1 Timothy chapter two, verse nine, Paul says this,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.220]   "I want women," you can apply the same thing to men,
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.400]   "to dress modestly, with decency and propriety."
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.880]   Propriety is not a word that we use often,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.840]   it just means with appropriate dress,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.700]   or appropriate clothing.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.980]   "Adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles,
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.720]   "gold, pearls, expensive clothes, but with good deeds,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.520]   "appropriate for those women who profess God."
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.280]   What is he saying, God's against hairstyle?
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.040]   No, in this day and age, this was written to Timothy,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.600]   who is inside of the city of Ephesus.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.440]   Ephesus was a city that oftentimes women
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.040]   would put all kinds of things and flashy things
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.120]   in their hair in order to attract the attention
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960]   of other men.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.600]   It's also where the temple of Aphrodite was.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.520]   And so it was a very sexually promiscuous city
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.600]   and environment, and Paul's not saying
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.560]   God's against those things.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.120]   He's saying, "Let your true beauty come from inside.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.300]   "May you be adorned with a modesty of the heart."
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.520]   It's not just about your clothes,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.240]   it all comes down to the heart behind what you wear.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.520]   He says, "May they be marked with good deeds,
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.480]   "focused not just on good looks, but on good work."
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.900]   So here's the biblical definition of modesty.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.720]   Modesty means dressing in a way that reveals godliness
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.340]   and humility of the heart.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.060]   It doesn't mean being frumpy, doesn't mean being unstylish.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.260]   You be on trend and all of that, and still honor God
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.360]   with how you dress yourself.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.140]   But modesty is a matter of the heart.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.880]   One of the reasons it's further challenging,
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.040]   and it is a matter of the heart,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.400]   is what it looks like to be modest in different cultures
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.040]   looks different.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.420]   If you go to different areas in remote parts
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.400]   of third world countries today,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.080]   they would not be described in our culture as modest.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.400]   You go to different time periods throughout history,
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.840]   and 100 years ago, what's totally appropriate today
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.380]   would not be appropriate.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.560]   You guys know what this is?
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.080]   [tapping]
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.180]   This is a bikini.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.080]   I know you guys have probably never seen
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.920]   one of these before.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.040]   It's a lot of awkward laughter just now.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.920]   The bikini was invented in 1946
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.960]   by a guy named Louis Reard.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.040]   He was a French guy.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.480]   It's always the French, man.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.320]   [audience laughing]
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.880]   He invents this thing, and he named it bikini.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.360]   You wanna know why?
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.000]   Because at that time, in 1946,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.720]   there was an island off of West New Guinea.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.240]   It was an island that America occupied
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.760]   that had done all types of testing for nuclear atomic bombs.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.320]   And on that island was where they were testing
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.240]   these atomic bombs.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.760]   And Reard said, "This invention that I've come up with,
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.100]   "this two-piece of clothing, will be an atomic bomb
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.680]   "throughout culture and fashion."
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.200]   And it was.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.360]   Reard was famous for saying that he came up
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.000]   with an invention, a two-piece bathing suit
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.720]   that reveals everything about a girl
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.420]   except her mother's maiden name.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.520]   [audience laughing]
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.400]   It was so scandalous at the time.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.160]   To us, it's not scandalous at all.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.960]   It was so scandalous at the time
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.040]   that Spain, Italy, and America outlawed it.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.800]   In other words, that teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.400]   yellow polka-dot bikini you've heard this song before,
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.000]   that's about a girl who won't come out of the water
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.980]   'cause she's afraid she's gonna be seen.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.320]   Because if you got seen, you would be dismissed
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.680]   or not able to swim at the beach.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.240]   It was scandalous.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.440]   And then the sexual revolution took place,
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.360]   and we have all been so desensitized.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.260]   I don't know if you guys like hot tubs.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.380]   One thing happens any time you get in a hot tub.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.360]   This just took a weird turn.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.600]   We got bikinis, hot tubs.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.520]   [audience laughing]
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.640]   You know what happens when you get in?
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.680]   It's like 103 degrees, feels great, this is awesome.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.720]   10 minutes in, what?
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.120]   [laughs]
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.880]   You're sweaty, yeah, it's true.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.040]   You're like, it's not hot.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.960]   You're kinda like, oh man, 'cause you want the hot tub
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.880]   to just bring it just a little bit on you,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.160]   and whenever you get used to it, it's not as hot.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.360]   And it's not because the temperature changed.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.520]   It's because you got desensitized to it.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.080]   Same thing has happened as it relates to modesty
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.500]   for all of us, and really as a culture.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.840]   So our cue doesn't come from culture
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.240]   and what the world says around us
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320]   is the appropriate standard of modesty.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.280]   It comes from what God's word says,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.400]   and it comes down to a question and a matter of the heart.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.120]   Why am I wearing what I'm wearing?
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.440]   Is what I'm wearing honoring to God?
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.360]   So modesty, first and foremost, is a matter of the heart.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.440]   It is choosing to reflect through my dress
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   godliness and humility that exists inside of my heart.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.220]   Because Christ has changed my heart,
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.340]   it often leads to me changing my clothes.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.420]   So here's three reasons why that type of modesty
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.180]   at a heart level, where you begin to evaluate,
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.580]   hey, is what I'm wearing honoring to God or not?
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.780]   Begin to evaluate, why would I wear this?
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.320]   Why would I post this picture?
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.840]   Three reasons why modesty is better.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.480]   The first one is huge.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.800]   Because modesty attracts the right people.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.640]   Modesty attracts the right people
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.120]   or attracts the right person.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.280]   Most of us in the room would say we're single
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.120]   and we are interested, likely and hopefully
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.600]   not being single forever.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.480]   And if you in this stage want to make sure
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.240]   that you attract the right person along,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.940]   directly related to that is how you dress.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.000]   Because how you dress is gonna determine who you attract.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.140]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.020]   I don't know if we got any fishermen in the room.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.860]   There we go.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.280]   Man, represent, bro.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.420]   This is a bunch of tackle and fishing stuff.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Depending, if you know anything about fishing
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.180]   like this guy does, you would go fishing
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.620]   and depending on what type of bait you use
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.980]   will determine what you're gonna catch.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.420]   So if you're gonna use live worms or stink bait
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.300]   or something like that, you're gonna catch catfish.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.640]   If you wanna catch a bass, you're gonna use something
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.260]   that looks closer to something like this.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.600]   And I just, now I'm bleeding.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.640]   Poked myself with a hook.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.840]   You're gonna use something more like this.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.960]   If you wanna attract a striper or some other,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.240]   I don't really like fish, so whatever you're gonna attract,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.260]   it just determines what you're going to catch.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.040]   Every fisherman knows whatever he uses bait
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.760]   determines what you're gonna catch
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.480]   'cause there's certain fish that they're not
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.520]   gonna be appealed to by this.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.480]   They're not gonna bite on that.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.920]   And then there's other ones that are,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.740]   but they wouldn't be appealed to by this.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.000]   As it relates to what culture tells us
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.700]   when it comes to modesty or really when it comes
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.340]   to attracting someone, the message is
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.940]   that you use your body as bait.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.140]   You use how you dress.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.900]   You shake what your mama gave you.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.600]   You dress in a certain way that shows off your lady humps.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.420]   You put your biceps out there
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.640]   and you show the girls where it's at.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.460]   Here's the danger in that.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.740]   Whatever you use as bait is gonna determine what you catch.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.880]   You wanna catch a bass?
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.980]   Use those things.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.200]   You wanna catch a dumb bass?
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   You use your body.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.660]   I'm just talking about fish, man.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:16.180]   If you want to catch somebody who is a body snatcher,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.600]   that they want you for your body,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.840]   then you should use your body.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.260]   You should post more yoga pics of you doing yoga.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.320]   You should post more pictures of you in crop tops
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.760]   and those biker shorts.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.160]   You should be more seductive.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.920]   You should do everything you can out in public
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.760]   or out right now.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   This is not meant to put shame.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.120]   I'm literally just giving you advice.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.260]   If you wanna catch somebody that wants you for your body,
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.600]   then you should go full send in that direction.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.320]   But if you wanna catch a godly guy or a godly girl,
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.160]   let me give you the honest facts.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.080]   You come in and you're wearing, you know,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.400]   Beyonce's Super Bowl outfit from two years ago.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.140]   Every guy in the room is gonna think you're attractive.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.640]   Godly guys will not be attracted to you.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.240]   They may struggle with lustful thoughts about you,
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.360]   but they will not be attracted to you
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.440]   because the godly guy does what?
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.680]   The godly guy is attracted to the things
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.880]   that God is attracted to.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.440]   Just like a godly girl is attracted to the things
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.320]   that God is attracted to.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.560]   What is God attracted to?
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.200]   In 1 Samuel 16, it says this.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.320]   Do not look at the outward appearance,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.440]   for the Lord does not see as man sees.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.840]   Man looks on the outward appearance,
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.140]   but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.800]   The Lord looks at what's inside of a person.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   That's what makes them attractive,
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.860]   their heart, their character.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.900]   This is what a godly guy looks for.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.200]   And when I say, hey, godly guys,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.100]   you come dressed in that way,
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.000]   you're gonna catch the attention of men who are like, wow.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.120]   But the people who are gonna be drawn in
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.240]   and bite onto that bait
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.400]   are not gonna be the godly men that you want
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.520]   or the godly women that you want.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.760]   They're gonna be people who want you for your body.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.120]   You know the danger if you catch a guy from your body
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.080]   or catch a guy for your body,
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.980]   you catch for your boobs, catch from your leg gap,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.000]   you will lose him for someone else
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.040]   with better boobs, better leg gap,
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.400]   better butt, more fit, younger,
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.940]   because you caught a body snatcher.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.780]   That's what you did.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.440]   You baited, you used the bait.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.460]   I'm gonna catch somebody
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.400]   that doesn't care about what's on the inside like God does.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.480]   He cares about what's on the outside.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.000]   So the moment he finds something better on the outside,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.880]   he's moving on.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.960]   And God, and I think most of us are your heart of hearts,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.760]   you don't wanna be somebody who just attracts somebody
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.240]   based on the superficial characteristics.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.620]   That's why you ended up got a man.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.400]   The danger further
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.920]   is that, and this is where,
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.720]   like Ken and my heart breaks for the women in the room.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.920]   As a dad of a daughter,
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.000]   my heart on this issue has only become more concerned
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.760]   and more heartbroken of all the different temptations,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.100]   the things that candidly, the women in this room,
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.640]   and men have challenges, temptations as well.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.680]   But from an early age,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.760]   all the different messages about what's beautiful
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.680]   and what you need to look like
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.520]   and how you should be thinner and how you should be skinnier
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.760]   and how you should physically display yourself in nuance
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   and show off your curves
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.560]   and show off different accentuate parts of your body
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.800]   and how dangerous that is.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.160]   If that's at the centerpiece of your relationship,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.520]   if that's ultimately the reason why
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.920]   you attracted that person,
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.600]   specifically for women,
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.000]   because do you know the standard of beauty for men and women
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.880]   as they age varies dramatically?
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.780]   In other words, the average age of what a woman,
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.280]   when she's 22, is attracted to,
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.840]   and a woman when she's 42 and attracted to,
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.360]   and 52 and attracted to,
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.920]   is very, very different than what a man,
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.680]   when he's 25 and attracted to,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.200]   35 and attracted to,
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.000]   45 and attracted to the average man.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.840]   In fact, let me show you.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.720]   Here's a chart of a woman,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.200]   a woman's average age of attraction.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.120]   So this is, if you're 22 on the left,
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.600]   all those numbers represent the age of the woman.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.400]   So if she's 26, she's attracted to 27 year old, on average.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   She's 29, 29 year old.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.000]   33, 32 year old.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.720]   39, 38 year old.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.460]   44, she gets a little crazy,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.680]   goes for the 40 year old.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.040]   50, 46.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.800]   It just, generally speaking, follows.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.080]   That's why your mom is like, oh my gosh, George Clooney.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.100]   Oh, George, George.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.360]   But most of you girls would be like,
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.080]   oh man, Shawn Mendes is way more attractive than he is.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.940]   Let me show you the male chart.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.640]   Boom!
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.040]   Yeah, it's pretty shocking.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.020]   Here's why this really matters.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.100]   One, it shows how much more shallow guys are.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.800]   Number two, the average guy,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.300]   if you attract and bait with the average guy,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.060]   or even the average girl out there,
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.520]   you wanna find somebody who doesn't just love you
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.540]   for your physical characteristics or attraction,
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.980]   but you can take that down.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:10.020]   But they are attracted to your character, like God is.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.940]   God says that you and I are to look for other people,
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.700]   or spouses of noble character.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.380]   Because unlike beauty, all of that is going away.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.840]   Gravity wins on everybody.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.060]   Nobody beats gravity.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.500]   Even the 57 year old who's Botoxed to the roof
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.840]   doesn't beat gravity.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.420]   She just looks like she can't stop smiling.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.440]   And so you wanna make sure, in this stage of life,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.120]   next to who you're gonna worship as your God,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.140]   who is gonna be your master in life,
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.140]   who's gonna be your mate that you run with,
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.220]   is one of the most important decisions you make.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.740]   And you wanna make sure that it's not a relationship
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.100]   that's built, that starts, that's initiated,
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.920]   by you baiting with your body.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.820]   Second reason why modesty is not hottest, but it's better,
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.740]   is modesty reveals your dignity.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.780]   It says something about you.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.780]   When you decide, I'm gonna dress modestly,
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.140]   like I'm aware, I'm thoughtful, I'm not frumpy,
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.200]   I'm not ugly, I'm not unstylish, I'm classy,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.960]   I reveal my dignity.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.480]   First Peter chapter three says this.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.840]   Your beauty should not come from outward adornment,
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.280]   such as elaborate hairstyles,
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.360]   wearing of gold jewelry, fine clothes.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.680]   Not that those things are a problem,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.480]   that's just not where you should find your beauty,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.400]   your worth.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   Rather, it should come from your inner self.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.080]   From the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.680]   which is of great worth in God's sight,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.780]   it should come from inside.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.140]   This is the way holy women of the past
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.060]   put their hope in God, used to dress or adorn themselves.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.920]   Let me read that verse in ESV, it's another translation.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.620]   It says, "Let your adorning come from the hidden person
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.780]   "of the heart, with the imperishable beauty
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.720]   "of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.780]   "which is precious in God's spirit."
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.260]   But you are a person.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.260]   You don't dress in order to accentuate a part of your body,
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.820]   you're so much more than a body part.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.240]   You're a person, you're made in the image of God.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.100]   You have no idea how of a measurable worth you are.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.560]   And accentuating your butt, your boobs, your biceps,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.220]   any of that stuff in order to get the attention
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:23.120]   of a person belittles you down to a handful of parts.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.520]   You're a person.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.700]   And Peter says, "Your beauty should reveal,"
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.600]   or modesty, "reveals the dignity that you have."
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.260]   For those of us who believe this,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.260]   especially as a child of God, of the King.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.220]   Maybe the best way of putting modesty
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.260]   is modesty is not about hiding your body.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.460]   That's typically what people think.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.720]   It is about revealing your dignity.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.540]   Modesty is not about hiding your body, covering up,
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.740]   it is about revealing your dignity.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:01.220]   That you're a person, you're not a part,
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.680]   some parts are an object to be used.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.740]   There was a Princeton study that was done
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.360]   that Guardian wrote about where it basically says this.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.980]   It links to the fact that there's an association
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.380]   that happens, and this is really important, girls.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.860]   It's a science saying something happens
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:23.460]   when a person is seen in either an outfit
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.860]   or a scandal clad or is immodest.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.700]   And here's what they wrote.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.540]   This is from Princeton University.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.780]   In a Princeton study, male students were shown
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.740]   images of women they did not know that were scandally clad.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.580]   Underwear, midriff, bikini.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.660]   Brain scans were done as they saw them
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.420]   that revealed when looking at the pictures,
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.540]   the section of the male brain that responds to tools
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.180]   like hammers and wrenches lit up.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.680]   Scans of some of the men found that a part of the brain
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.400]   associated with empathy or concern
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.660]   for other people's emotions went completely dark
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.620]   after looking at the pictures.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.860]   The lack of activation, Susan Fiske,
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.820]   the psychologist at Princeton, in this area
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.260]   is really odd because it hardly ever happens.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.420]   It's as if they are reacting to women
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.720]   as though they are not fully human.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.460]   It's consistent with the idea that they're responding
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.800]   to these photographs as if they were responding
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.640]   to objects, not people.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.400]   What is it, what's the Princeton study saying?
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.900]   It's saying, hey, when we show these pictures
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.500]   of images of women and they were not fully clothed
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.580]   in all the way that would be modest,
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.420]   it activated something in the male brain
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.020]   and it shut something else down
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.740]   where it began to see the person they were looking at
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.780]   not as a person but as an object to use.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.540]   There's a really tragic movement right now
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.700]   that has attached itself to some really positive things
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.760]   like women's empowerment and Go Women,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.880]   which we are all about.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.000]   God made you uniquely you, beautifully in the image of God.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.760]   You are a queen, sister.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.280]   But it has attached itself to a freedom,
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.640]   you can't tell me what to do, my body, my choice,
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.420]   you don't have any right, I'm gonna do whatever I want,
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.120]   dress however I want, I'll go out naked if I want to,
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.040]   which is ironically, in an ironic twist,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.440]   under the name of power, that I can do whatever I want.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.040]   It's exercising power.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.940]   But the power, Princeton University says,
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.360]   after studying, that power is to shut down
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.400]   a male's ability to see you as a person
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.460]   and become an object.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.720]   Ironically, the exact opposite
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.920]   of what would actually empower women,
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.080]   that I'm more than just some breasts in a body,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.360]   I'm a person.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.880]   And our culture rages on about, man,
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.720]   you should do whatever you want, dress however you want,
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.520]   it is empowering to see Beyonce get up and do what she does,
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.240]   it is empowering to see Cardi B get up and do that.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.200]   It's powerful in all the most destructive ways.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:17.720]   Modesty reveals your dignity.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.920]   To those in the room, I know there's part of us,
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.800]   candidly, honestly, when you hear about like,
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.440]   oh man, seen as an object, lusted after,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.300]   there's something in you that's like, I kind of want that.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.060]   Just want you to ask the question, why?
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.960]   Am I telling you that what you wear
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.800]   and you can't wear something?
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.480]   No, I'm saying you're so much bigger than what you wear.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   You're a person, you have dignity,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.080]   you're made in the image of God.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.560]   And maybe you're trying to fill some hole
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.600]   because you didn't have a strong father figure
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.840]   that was around in your life.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.240]   You didn't have somebody that called you beautiful.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.360]   So there's something inside of it just craves,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.260]   you know, the attention 'cause it makes you feel beautiful.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:08.160]   And it's leading you to look for affirmation
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.640]   that candidly, you can feed and you can post pictures.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.680]   You can go on Instagram today, post the whole butt pic,
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.160]   do whatever you want and you know what you're gonna get?
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.200]   You're gonna get attention from men.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.120]   You're gonna get that itch scratched,
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.040]   but that itch isn't going away.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.400]   It's gonna come back and come back
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.480]   and lead to cycles of insecurity and need for approval
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.760]   and need for attention,
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   all in the name of trying to fill some void, some emptiness.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.840]   And the guy who's gonna give that attention,
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.140]   he doesn't care about you.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.040]   What's going on in his brain right there is object to use,
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.680]   object to use, object to use.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.420]   You are so much more valuable than that.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.660]   A friend of mine was, he's a graphic designer
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.200]   and he was starting kind of a side,
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.800]   he works full time as a graphic designer
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.440]   and he was starting his own private company
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.440]   and we went to lunch and I was catching up with him
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.240]   and I asked him how stuff was going
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.640]   and he had just started it and I asked him,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.480]   what do you charge?
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.880]   Like, what do you charge per hour?
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.040]   And what he charged was like so low.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.680]   I was like, dude, you're worth so much more than that.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.560]   You totally need to charge more than that.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.360]   People, one, will pay it and two,
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.500]   you are worth way more than what you're charging per hour
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.320]   to do graphic design for things.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.620]   Don't sell yourself short.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.940]   To every person in the room who is using their body,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.100]   giving themselves away, putting themselves out there,
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.940]   trying to get attention,
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.980]   you are worth so much more than that.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.540]   You're worth so much more than the fleeting attention
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.280]   of some dumb ass guys.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.820]   That yeah, they'll give it to you
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.460]   and they wanna see it.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.300]   Thank you.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.000]   You are worth the very life of Jesus on the cross.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.140]   And everything that I'm saying may not be enough,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.840]   but I just want you to examine your heart
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.800]   and ask yourself, 'cause remember,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.680]   modesty is a matter of the heart.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.740]   Why?
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.000]   And maybe the most godly thing you could do tonight
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.820]   is go, it's not enough.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.940]   I'm not enough.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.000]   I find who I am and what other people think about me.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.460]   I find who I am and what other people say about how I look.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.020]   I find who I am in getting attention from people,
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.320]   girls and guys.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:17.240]   And that would be the most positive step you could take.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.900]   'Cause you can't change and you can't face,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.460]   or you can't fight what you're not willing to face.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:28.340]   So second reason is it reveals your dignity.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.260]   And reason number three, the reason modesty is better
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.820]   is because of who it attracts.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.260]   It attracts the right people.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.500]   Reason number two, and that it reveals your dignity.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:47.060]   And that modesty, number three, honors God
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.480]   by serving others.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.780]   Modesty honors God by serving other people.
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.100]   You may not know this and be aware,
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.620]   but the Bible says that you and I, if you're a Christian,
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.700]   this is only to Christians, by the way,
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.860]   there is something far more important
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.860]   if you're not a follower of Jesus
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.580]   that you understand and that you learn
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.700]   that how you dress and whatever you came in.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.820]   But as it relates to Christians,
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.260]   the Bible says that you and I are connected
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.780]   and to be aware and to be thoughtful
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.460]   about how we interact and how our actions impact
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.620]   other people around us.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.060]   In 1 Corinthians 8, it says this,
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.760]   "Be careful," this is 1 Corinthians 8, verse 8,
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.900]   "that the exercise of your rights,"
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.060]   hey, I'm free, I can do anything,
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.840]   nobody can tell me what to do,
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   "be careful that that exercise of rights
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.140]   "does not become a stumbling block
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.500]   "or cause other people to stumble, to sin."
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.460]   Stumbling block to the weak.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.820]   One of the ways that modesty and dressing modestly
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.140]   and being thoughtful about why am I wearing what I'm wearing
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.060]   is what I'm wearing honoring to God,
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.460]   what is what I'm wearing communicating,
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.800]   is that it serves other people around us.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.840]   How does it serve other people?
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.440]   Honestly, it serves both sexes here.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.620]   We live in this weird environment and culture
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.100]   where social media makes everything
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.100]   this constant comparison game.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.580]   And one thing that we as Christians to do
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.300]   is not feed into it, where I'm gonna make sure
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.580]   that I'm not putting a thirst trap out there
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.740]   for other people to post on and tag on
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.240]   and you're gonna get comments from people
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.420]   that are gonna be positive like,
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.640]   "Oh man, that body though."
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.420]   But it is feeding into this comparison,
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.620]   insecurity, constantly evaluating and comparing myself.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.780]   And then, you know, I need to go home,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.220]   make sure that I post this picture of me on the beach
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.380]   with my girls from up top.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.000]   And it's not serving other people.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.620]   And one way that you and I can say,
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.140]   "I'm just not gonna feed into that.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.860]   "I'm not gonna be doing TikTok videos in my underwear,
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.560]   "running around, trying to get attention from people."
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.020]   That's a thing, okay?
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.940]   I think it's a thing, I don't know honestly, but.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:45.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.580]   If it is a thing, if it's your thing,
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.820]   maybe worth evaluating.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.540]   But one way it does is it serves others.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.660]   It serves the opposite sex by not being a stumbling block.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.200]   And this is really, really tender.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.780]   So let me try to be as careful as I can
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.460]   'cause it can be really challenging.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.100]   A lot of times when this comes up, it's like,
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.520]   "Hey, it ain't my problem if he lusting over this, okay?
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.020]   "I could wear a burlap sack and he'd be like,
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.060]   "Oh girl, where you get that burlap from?"
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.720]   It's not, that's his problem.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.440]   He'd be in an astronaut suit and he'd be like,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.580]   "Hey girl, where you at, astronaut?"
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.140]   Fact, that is correct.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.560]   That is his problem.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.540]   That is somebody's sin and the decision to give in
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.780]   to that sexual temptation or to lust after somebody else,
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.260]   that is their own problem.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.500]   We talk a lot about that issue all around here.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.520]   But the Bible says that you and I are to be thoughtful
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.600]   to not put a stumbling block in front of somebody else.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.660]   To not put a stumbling block in front
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.820]   of a brother in Christ or a sister in Christ.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.900]   The decisions that we wear and the response of,
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.140]   "Hey, well it's my body, I can do whatever I want with it."
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.660]   That is right, unless you're a Christian.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.940]   First Corinthians chapter six says this
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.800]   about the idea of whose body it is.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.620]   You were not your own.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.740]   You were bought at a price.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.820]   That price was Jesus on the cross.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.920]   Therefore honor God with your bodies.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.700]   You remember Cain and Abel?
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.320]   One of the very first sins of humanity
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.500]   was a story Cain and Abel, Genesis chapter four,
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.300]   early in the game, straight out the gate.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.860]   First two kids on the planet.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.460]   Things didn't go well 'cause 10 minutes in, Cain kills Abel.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.460]   God shows up to Cain, says, "Where's your brother?"
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:30.300]   And Cain says, "What am I, my brother's keeper?"
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.620]   And the response was, "Yes, you have a responsibility
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.100]   "and I have a responsibility
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.060]   "to what's on the inside of our life."
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.580]   So one of the ways that modesty is better
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.760]   is that it serves God and honors other people around us.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.660]   I think one of the challenges of this issue
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.460]   is you can't only just to be really real.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.020]   When sin entered the world, everything fractured.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.140]   Every person in this room, every person who's ever lived
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.340]   has a sin nature.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.900]   Things are not as they're supposed to be.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.700]   Our thoughts are not as they're supposed to be.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.660]   Our heart is not as it's supposed to be.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.100]   Because we have something called a sin nature,
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.260]   which means sin comes naturally to us.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.180]   That's what happened when sin entered the world.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.780]   The male brain as it relates to lust,
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.700]   and I'm sharing this not to create anything
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.580]   other than a better understanding
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.480]   where I think there is a bit of a gap.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.540]   As it relates to a woman, when you walk in the room
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.580]   and you're wearing your workout clothes
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.380]   and there's a midriff and you think,
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.300]   oh my gosh, matching, so cute.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.420]   He's not thinking that.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.180]   He's thinking, if he's a godly guy,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.820]   he's thinking, oh my gosh, I do not wanna look at that.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.660]   I do not wanna look at that.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.660]   I do not wanna look at that
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.120]   because I'm gonna picture her naked.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.500]   And part of me will think through
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.360]   or could lead to thoughts of having sex with her.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.880]   It's just easy to go there.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.100]   I was talking with some of our team earlier today
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.500]   and I was mentioning the bikini thing
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.940]   where honestly this further is just confusing
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.780]   and breaking my heart.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.720]   Where on the label it's like something cheeky
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.380]   about the level of cheekiness.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.820]   I was like, there's levels of cheekiness?
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.220]   And this led to, oh yeah, I went to the store
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.220]   and there was a mannequin display of cheekiness levels.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.260]   What would go through?
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.120]   And one of the other guys responding to this guy saying that
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.340]   was like, dude, you shouldn't be looking
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.460]   at those mannequins like that.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.980]   If you're a girl in the room, you're thinking,
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.180]   what is wrong, it's a mannequin.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.880]   If you're a guy, you're like, yeah, I got that.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.720]   Get that, yep.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.080]   I connect those dots.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.400]   There's just something when sin entered that broke
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.840]   and it's not right.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.880]   And godly men fight it, surrender to the spirit,
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.360]   they pursue purity and they prioritize intimacy and sex
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.880]   inside of the context of marriage.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:56.660]   But you have to understand the visual aspect of men,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.120]   partly in order to just love your brother
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.920]   and understand it and know that they live in,
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.480]   here's what you don't know about men.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.520]   We live in a world where pornography for most of us
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.920]   was introduced, at least for me at age 12.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.480]   It was introduced at such a young age
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.640]   and that brokenness gets attached to it.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.480]   We live in a world where we can't drive around
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.800]   and you know all that visualness and you're like,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.880]   yeah, I like visual too.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.040]   It's not the same for most.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.220]   Psychological studies even show the sexual drive
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.120]   of men and women is very, very different.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.560]   I don't have time to go into all of that right now.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.480]   But you live in a world where every man around you,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.360]   the ability to have a woman in lingerie
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.120]   in the moment that he sees her,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.560]   be the very first time that he's ever seen her,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.000]   be their wedding night, was taken from him.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.280]   He can't drive down the street or drive down the road
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.400]   without seeing a billboard with that.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.000]   He can't watch the Super Bowl
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.200]   without seeing Janet Jackson's exposed.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.020]   All of that was taken.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.120]   Same thing was taken away from women in this room.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.040]   I mean, imagine a world where the very first time
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.560]   you ever saw someone naked of the opposite sex
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.820]   was your wedding night.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.160]   Not even like, you never saw a bikini,
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.000]   you never saw a lingerie, anything.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.840]   The poof.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.880]   That's sinning in the world and it's fractured everything.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.480]   And as Christians, we can either decide that,
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.080]   you know, we're gonna feed into it and contribute it
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.640]   and be okay with it and go along with it.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.440]   Or we can say, I am worth so much more than my body.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.920]   I'm a person.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.320]   I'm not gonna feed into that.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   I don't need that to feed inside of me
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.600]   and the parts of me that candidly,
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.480]   I kind of do want it to feed, you know,
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.080]   and I wanna feel attracted and desired.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.400]   I wanna surrender those to God,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.060]   confess those to people around me
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.920]   because I'm going to honor God
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.960]   by serving other people around me.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.320]   Other people, and if you're listening,
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.960]   this isn't just about guys and it's not about girls
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.800]   'cause guys can be just as guilty and just as unaware
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.840]   of walking around with your shirt off
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.460]   or posting a picture shirtless with sunglasses
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.960]   being like, check out my new sunglasses.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.080]   And it's like, bro, you're thirst trapped, man.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   It's for you, you're thirst trapped.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.720]   This is exactly what you're doing.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.620]   But Christians, the command that Jesus said
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.340]   would be the criteria or the quality that would mark us.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.840]   This is how you'll know you're my followers.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.800]   John 13 said, by this one thing,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.640]   the whole world will know that you're my followers,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   that you love one another.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.240]   In Romans chapter 13, I'm about to land the plane.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.320]   Paul wrote something that I think
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.520]   is such a beautiful way of putting it
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.920]   where he talks about how Christians
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.800]   should interact with each other.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.320]   And here's what he says, Romans 13, verse seven,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.560]   "Let no debt remain outstanding."
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.420]   In other words, pay off every debt.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.180]   "Accept the continuing debt to love one another.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:41.020]   "For whoever loves has fulfilled the law.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.540]   "The commandments, you shall not commit adultery,
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.240]   "shall not murder, shall not steal, covet,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.960]   "whatever other command you could find,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.500]   "are summed up in this one command,
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.060]   "love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.140]   "Love does no harm to a neighbor.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:01.260]   "Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law."
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.680]   As we wrap up, I just want you to think about
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.160]   why do you wear what you wear?
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.280]   When you get dressed tomorrow,
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.240]   about why am I going to wear what I wear?
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.000]   Why am I posting what I'm posting?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.860]   Is it to draw attention to myself?
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.300]   Is it to draw attention or to get some affirmation
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.080]   that I just feel like there's such a hole?
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.140]   Or is it to honor God, to reveal my dignity,
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.620]   whose I am and who I am?
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.800]   In conclusion, modest isn't hottest.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.660]   It's holy and it's better
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.500]   because it attracts the right people.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:46.140]   It reveals your dignity and it honors God
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.560]   by serving other people around you.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.280]   There's a show my wife and I have been watching
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.600]   called "The Crown."
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.120]   It's a show about the British royal family.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.800]   It's a fascinating kind of show
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.960]   because Queen Elizabeth, who's a queen right now,
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.000]   has been queen for like 10,000 years.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.040]   And it goes all the way back to when she was a high schooler
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.020]   or yeah, a high schooler.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.760]   And it goes up through today, essentially, or it will.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.400]   Inside of the royal family, it's really interesting
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.480]   because one of the designations, I didn't realize this,
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.120]   but do you know every member of the royal family
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.060]   has a crown?
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.320]   In other words, when you go to a wedding,
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.980]   you go to a banquet, you go to a state event,
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.120]   one of the ways that you can know this person is a royal,
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.420]   this person is not, is they have a crown.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:37.200]   Based on what they wear, you know who they are.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.180]   Based on what they wear, you can just see if they're a royal.
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.520]   What's further interesting about the royal family is
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.100]   it's all pretend.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.920]   I know we think like, no, it's not.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.080]   They're not Harry, they just had a baby.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.820]   Yeah, it's all pretend.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.720]   They don't have any authority, they're mascots.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.520]   They don't have any legislative law.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.720]   They don't even have any ability to,
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.160]   hey, you know what, we're changing this whole thing,
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.560]   parliament, and you're done.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.680]   They're mascots.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   They're all based on the opinion of people
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.880]   assuming like, oh, you're a royal.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.920]   It's pretend.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.880]   And all these ancient etiquettes and all that stuff,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.960]   it's cool, and it's, you know,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.220]   some ways kind of historically poetic,
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.400]   but it's pretend.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.160]   There's nothing special about the royal blood.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.560]   In fact, the family's not even English.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.960]   They changed their name to the House of Windsor
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.160]   from Saxe-Gotha because it sounded too German in the war,
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.720]   and they were like, German's not a great look right now.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.640]   Let's change it.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.480]   You know what, from the blood of the English heritage,
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.200]   it's this pretend.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.000]   You know what's not pretend or infinitely more true?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.280]   If you were a Christian, this is not cliche,
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.200]   you are a daughter of God.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.840]   You are a son of the King of Kings.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.920]   The royal blood of Christ has both covered you,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.840]   and the DNA of God Almighty
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.580]   runs through your spiritual veins.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.320]   You are part and have been adopted into the family of God.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.440]   There's no title, there is no job,
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.320]   there is no honor you could hold
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.560]   that will be higher than that.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.800]   Unlike a pretend King of England, you are a royal.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.360]   And you could tell what a royal is by what they wear.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.960]   And Galatians chapter four says this,
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.020]   "At the right time, God sent his son, born of a woman,
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:28.600]   and Jesus came to buy freedom
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.320]   for those of us who are slaves to the law,
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.720]   so that he could adopt us as his very own children.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.880]   And because we're God's children,
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   he sent the spirit of his son into our hearts,
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.400]   calling us to cry out, Abba, which means dad, father,
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.600]   and now you're no longer a slave, but God's own child.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.720]   And since you're his child, he's made you an heir.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.280]   So often we post things because we wanna be wanted,
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.000]   we wanna be chosen, we wear things
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.840]   'cause we want attention, we wanna be chosen,
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.800]   we wanna be wanted.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.360]   And the truth behind that lie is you already have been.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.380]   If you are a follower of Christ, you have been chosen.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.420]   I've got a two and a half year old daughter.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.940]   Here's a picture of her from today.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.920]   Her and her mom went picking berries.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.700]   She's the best.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.000]   She's about to be three.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.500]   We call her, her name's Monroe.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.640]   She's a firecracker.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.800]   We call her Momo, and she is gonna be a handful
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.840]   for the rest of her life.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.420]   Already, she's obsessed with shoes, pink, with clothes.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.900]   Like, I mean, the girl has some opinions.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.460]   Here's what I want for her so desperately.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:45.000]   I want her to know that no matter what she does in life,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.720]   no matter what she looks like, who she marries,
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.720]   who she dates, that she is of such extraordinary value
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.520]   of incredible dignity because she was made
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.780]   in the image of God.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.740]   She was so valuable to God that he would give his life
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.540]   on the cross for her, that he would go to that cross
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.820]   and he would pay for every sin that she's ever committed,
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.660]   everything that she will ever do, and die in her place.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:14.540]   She has been chosen, and that in accepting that,
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.280]   she's adopted into the royal family of God,
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.360]   the only royal family there is.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:25.080]   And she doesn't need to look to men, and my heart breaks
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.720]   'cause I know that I can't protect her
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.000]   from all the temptations and all the different lies
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.500]   and all the different identity problems
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.720]   and all the different insecurities
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.960]   that are gonna come for her.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.460]   But I pray that when she does, she will do what you do,
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.520]   which is cling to because of what Christ did,
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.800]   I am a daughter of the King, I am chosen, I'm forgiven.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.360]   I'm not gonna settle for any man
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.760]   who treats me less than that.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.500]   How long are you to give yourself over to guys
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.600]   who are jerks?
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.720]   They want you for your body, they want you for sex.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.360]   Or girls, on the flip side, guys, how long are you
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.880]   gonna give yourself over to settling for somebody
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.620]   who doesn't have the characteristics of a godly woman?
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.480]   You are worth so much more than that.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.900]   And I hope she knows modest isn't hottest,
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.420]   it is holy and it is better and it leads to life.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:19.020]   Let me pray.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.760]   Father, I do pray for protection.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.860]   I just, I wanna pray for every person in this room
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:30.560]   who they feel like they are damaged goods.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.840]   They feel like their value comes from how they look.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.020]   They've been told messages maybe from people
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.220]   who said they were Christians, maybe from parents
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.500]   who said, you know, you really need to cut back
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.460]   on what you eat or you shouldn't look this way,
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.300]   you need to change.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.180]   I pray that you would be louder right now.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.260]   Would you bury into our minds the truth
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.880]   that we, through Christ, we are children of God Almighty.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:02.340]   We are a part of the only royal line there is
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.480]   and ever will be.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.420]   And we would live and carry ourselves as such.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.420]   We wouldn't settle, we wouldn't allow,
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.480]   we wouldn't tolerate being treated as such
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.760]   or living as anything less than that.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.940]   I pray for every girl in this room
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.540]   who fights thousands of lies
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.660]   that I may not even be aware of.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.580]   I probably never will fully understand.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.380]   That you would fill them with strength,
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.300]   clothe them with strength and honor,
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.840]   like you say in the Proverbs.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.680]   And they would be godly, God-fearing women
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.720]   who end up marrying godly, God-fearing husbands
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.080]   and be godly parents together.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.560]   And we would raise up a generation
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.660]   who doesn't find our worth in how we look,
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.780]   but in who we worship.
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.080]   We worship you in song, amen.
