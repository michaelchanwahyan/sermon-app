[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.040]   - All right, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.720]   We doing okay tonight?
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.560]   Let's go.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.200]   Hey, it's so good to be back here with you
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.360]   this Tuesday night.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.920]   Special shout out to everybody tuning in with us right now.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.040]   Wherever it is that you're watching,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.800]   whether it's here this evening,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.500]   at some point in the future,
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.600]   we're so glad that you would choose to be a part
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.040]   of what God is doing.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.800]   Man, it happens in Dallas,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.000]   but it is happening around our nation
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.160]   and across the globe within your generation.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.360]   We love that God is, I mean, right now,
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.840]   like he is spiritually surging within the lives
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.320]   of young adults all over.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   And we feel it, like I just felt it.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.840]   Did you feel that?
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.680]   Like in worship, there's something palpable in the room,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.080]   and that's something that we want to be true in this space,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.200]   that we would come,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.740]   and we wouldn't just intellectually ascend
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.920]   and learn great things,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.120]   and we wouldn't just get all caught up in our feels
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.000]   because it feels good to come in and emote a little bit,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.920]   but we would actually find the unification
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.880]   of those two things,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.820]   and we would experience God together because he's here.
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.800]   Often, it's just a matter of us waking up to that reality.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.200]   So thanks for being here.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.480]   Special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.360]   that are tuning in,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360]   Porch Live Indy, Porch Live Boise, and Porch Live Midland.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.440]   Special shout out to you guys.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.160]   Midland, we love them.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.960]   Hey, I'm really excited for tonight.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.440]   I don't want to waste much more time.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.560]   Obviously, this setup is different than normal,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.320]   and because last week, we cued
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.800]   that we're gonna do a little bit of a round table,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.600]   a little, that we're gonna spend an evening
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.920]   just conversating about a topic
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.320]   we think is really important.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.360]   And to help me with it,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840]   we've got a couple of special guests.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.800]   We've got both Timothy Atik, TA, who you know,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.440]   elder lead pastor here at Watermark Community Church,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.280]   and then we have a very special guest
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.680]   returning to the Porch stage, Miss Brenna Blaine.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.920]   Porch, would y'all do an excellent job
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.320]   of helping welcome both of them to the stage at this time?
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.040]   [audience cheering]
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.720]   Don't be shy.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.280]   Y'all come on up.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.320]   It's amazing.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.160]   Great to see y'all.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.720]   Y'all grab a seat, please.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.040]   Porch, here's where we're going this evening.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.920]   We set this up last week for you
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.840]   that we wanted to take some time tonight,
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.080]   and we wanted to really have a conversation
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.800]   about something that is deeply relevant to our current day.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.960]   We want to talk to you about sexuality.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.640]   And the reason why we want to do it
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520]   is because here at the Porch,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   we not only want to be relevant
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.680]   because we want to be cool or we want to be current,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.120]   we want to be relevant because we want to be heard,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.720]   and we want to be helpful to you.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.400]   We realize that this is a subject
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.160]   that meets many of you right where you are.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.680]   And so we wanted to take an evening
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.800]   to really dedicate specific time
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.680]   to working our way through it.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   And in order to do so,
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.600]   I thought it'd be really helpful
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.760]   to have some friends join me.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.120]   TA is here because we believe that this subject
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.160]   is one that shouldn't just be preached about from the stage,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.800]   but it should be pastored from the floor.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.640]   And he's here as an expression of Watermark's love
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.720]   for those of you in the room
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.160]   that maybe this is a part of your story
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.920]   or it's the part of someone's story that you know.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.280]   And this is just our declaration to say,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   man, we want to walk with you through these types of issues.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.960]   We don't want to just preach about them.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.000]   We really want to shepherd you along the way.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.840]   So TA, thanks for being here.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.960]   And then Brenna is here
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.240]   because this is very much an authentic part
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.640]   of her experience.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.080]   And so Brenna, if you would,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.200]   I know that some people are familiar with you already.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.000]   It was awesome to see that there's some response
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.400]   just because you were here not even six months ago or so.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.640]   And we had the joy of spending time with you then,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.480]   but would you mind just catching everyone else up
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.440]   that hasn't had the chance
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.960]   to just learn a little bit about who you are
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.800]   and what your story is
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.400]   and why this subject is specifically something
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.920]   you've steeped yourself in study over
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.040]   and you've spent time looking at the scriptures for?
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.880]   - Yeah.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.040]   - Awesome.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.680]   - Well, like Kylan said, my name is Brenna.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.320]   I'm 29 years old.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.200]   And I think one of the two most important things about me
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.680]   is that I am a wife and I am a mom
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   to two little but big energy boys
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.400]   that I just deeply love.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   And in my job, I get to be a contemporary theologian.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.280]   And that's such a crazy thing to say.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.240]   But I did not get there easily.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.160]   I had to wrestle through some pretty significant suffering
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.920]   and complex things to get there.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.080]   And one of the most informative things
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   that I walked through was I was born into a pastor's home.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.720]   I'm a PK.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.440]   And that would have been really great for me,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   except I realized in my early teens
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.400]   that I am in fact attracted to the same sex.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   And I knew that made me incompatible
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.600]   with the person of Christ,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.880]   or at least that's what I thought in that place.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   And so it took a lot of questioning
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   and I think even running from God
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.160]   that the Lord used that to bring me back to him.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.040]   I still struggle with same sex attraction.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.560]   That's a temptation that has not been taken away from me.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.480]   But I believe in the faithfulness
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   and the goodness of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   And so I sit humbly before you all today
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.760]   that the Lord has allowed me to be here
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.840]   to share parts of what I've learned
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.440]   and what I've gone through.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.280]   The very first song we sang tonight,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.360]   I actually became super overwhelmed emotionally
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.960]   because I ran far away from God
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.080]   and I kind of physically ran away from God.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.520]   When I graduated, when I was a high schooler,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.480]   I moved to Maui, Hawaii,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.240]   because all I wanted to do was smoke weed,
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.480]   date hot women, and surf.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.000]   And so I went there to do that,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.240]   but I went there under the guise of being a missionary
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.880]   because I couldn't afford to get myself to Maui.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.320]   So I applied for this missions program,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.160]   got accepted 'cause I grew up in the church
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.960]   and knew how to use Christian language,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.000]   flew into the church,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.760]   knew how to use Christian language,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.480]   flew under the radar, ended up there,
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.760]   and got radically saved by the Lord.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.800]   And I remember I had to go home for my brother's wedding,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.320]   not very far into that stay.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.720]   I flew home and I remember thinking,
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.040]   my parents and everyone around me
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.800]   are going to be shocked.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   Um, because I'd faked it for so long
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.240]   and was so convinced that everyone else was faking it too.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.120]   And the moment that I met the Lord,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.440]   that was so transformative.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.400]   And I remember being home,
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.960]   about to go to my brother's wedding,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   I was upstairs in my bathroom and that song came on.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   And I felt full of the Holy Spirit
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.760]   for the first time in my life.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   And so to have that song play and be standing there
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.680]   and thinking about what God has done
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   over the last 10 years has just been incredibly humbling
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.880]   and blows my mind.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.960]   So thanks for letting me go on a tangent there.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.540]   (congregation applauding)
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:42.600]   - I mean, I think that even that is just a testament
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.160]   to the fact that like this,
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.480]   yes, we have planned for this moment.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.040]   And yet, as we were talking about earlier,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.760]   like we really want to be sensitive
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.440]   to the way in which the Spirit of God moves in this space.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.200]   We wanna be in inviting people to His work here.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.640]   And the fact that that connects so like,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.400]   it connects to such an important and pivotal moment
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.120]   in your story of grace is really amazing.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.400]   It's as if the Spirit sees what we're doing right now.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   So I'm really eager to get into this a little bit more
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.000]   and I'm really glad you're here.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.200]   Brenna, I think that your story probably resonates
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.800]   with someone in the room.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.920]   And if it doesn't resonate with someone personally,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.580]   it will resonate with someone in the sense
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.080]   that they know someone that it resonates with.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.400]   So there's really no one here that can see,
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.800]   can feel in themselves, this is irrelevant.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.640]   Like this is a wildly relevant issue,
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.960]   not just in our culture, but to us at an individual level.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.340]   For those that are resonating with it, I'm just curious,
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:49.360]   can you speak to, is their sexual orientation a sin
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.680]   or is it part of how God created them to be?
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.280]   - Yeah, I mean, my first thing,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.000]   and to just be transparent with everyone,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.040]   I'm a huge manuscripter.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.400]   I take notes, so we talked through these questions
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.680]   beforehand, so I'm gonna be reading through my notes
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.600]   so I can give you my absolute best.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.120]   But my first question is, who's asking the question
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.040]   and what are they struggling with?
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.240]   You can have a sexual orientation
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.560]   that is part of how God created you
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.760]   and parts of that orientation can be sinful.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.040]   So an example would be a young woman
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.840]   who is attracted to men.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   That is the God-created and ordained model of attraction
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.880]   that we have been given.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   However, post-fall, sin enters the world and lust does too.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.320]   And I think something that's interesting
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.480]   when I was thinking through this question
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   is a world without lust is so foreign to us
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.120]   that I think even as Christians,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.520]   especially single Christians,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   we do not recognize the microforms of lust
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.560]   in our life as lust.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   Like, I often wonder where attraction would stop
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.240]   or what the depth of attraction would be
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   as a single person pre-fall, if that makes sense.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   And so people with God-created orientations
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:35.160]   can still struggle with sin within that.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.720]   And then another example is a sexual orientation
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.100]   that exists as a result of the fall.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.460]   So your sexual desires have been disordered
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.880]   because of what has happened.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   So those orientations would be any attraction
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.520]   that falls outside of the marriage mandate,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.440]   which is one man, one woman for life.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.460]   So examples of this would be,
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.320]   like myself attracted to the same sex.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.180]   I don't believe God created me that way.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.760]   It's a result of the fall.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.620]   And if, I mean, it feels cheeky saying this,
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.640]   but I actually believe it.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   If you are a serial dater, God didn't create you that way.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.960]   And that is a result of the fall.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.600]   And if you find yourself bored of your spouse
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.160]   after 15 years, God still did not create you that way.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.440]   And that's a result of the fall.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.280]   So if your sexual appetite tells you,
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.040]   I need a new experience or a new person
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.520]   or new experiences with new people
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   or with a screen or a book to light up my imagination,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.680]   God didn't create you that way.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.160]   And that is a result of the fall.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.420]   - So would you say that it's right to say
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.720]   that a same sex orientation or a same sex attraction
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.320]   is not sin, but it is a result of the fall?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.000]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.320]   But we would say that same sex lust
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.680]   or same sex action would be sin.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.600]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.000]   - Yeah. - Okay, that's really helpful.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.960]   Now, Tia, I'd love to speak with you for a moment
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   and ask you, 'cause I think this is,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.000]   it's helpful to know, okay,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.120]   my same sex orientation is a result of the fall.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   Then what is the result in our identity through redemption?
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.480]   Even what we were visiting about earlier today,
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.680]   now that we're in Christ, what is the impact of that
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.360]   when it comes to the way we look at our life
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.400]   and the things that we actually identify with
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.320]   and how we process the circumstances
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.560]   or feelings that we have?
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.960]   - Yeah.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.600]   Well, I think, you know, the thing,
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.440]   the wrestle that I feel when I'm trying to talk to people
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.440]   about what God believes about them and their sexuality
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.200]   is that the message that people believe
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.320]   is the truest thing about me is my sexuality.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.280]   Like, that's the truest thing about me.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.000]   And I would say that in Christ,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.520]   that is not even close to being the truest thing about you.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.200]   Like, the truest thing about me
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.440]   is not that I am a heterosexual married man.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.320]   The truest thing about me in Christ
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.840]   is that I am a child of God.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.040]   Like, there is nothing that is truer,
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.800]   and there is nothing more definite and constant
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.720]   than that truth.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.320]   Because here's the reality.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.240]   I might not always be married.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.320]   Let me clarify what I'm saying.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.800]   My wife could, my wife, heaven forbid,
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   my wife could die tomorrow, and I am now a widower.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.240]   So, like, that status changes.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.600]   The thing that is truest about me,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.200]   my identity, is that I'm a child of God.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.560]   That's what Christ has done.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.600]   He didn't just come to save us from hell.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.800]   He came to save us into a family
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.560]   where we now know God as Father.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.080]   Not everyone is a child of God.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.720]   You're either a child of wrath or a child of God.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.800]   Christ makes us children of God.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.320]   And so, I think the lie that people believe
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.480]   is that the truest thing about me is my sexuality.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.040]   Therefore, my sexuality must define me,
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.760]   and my sexuality must drive me.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.160]   And that's just not true.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.640]   Like, as a child of God, that's what defines me.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.000]   So, the question that I have to ask and answer
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.560]   is what does it look like for me to take my orders
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.640]   from my heavenly Father?
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.560]   What does it look like for me to embody
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.320]   the family values of God?
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.520]   And what does it look like for that to define me
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.320]   and to drive me?
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.360]   And as a heterosexual married man,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.840]   like, that requires consistent surrender to that identity.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.600]   Like, Brenna and I, we're on the same journey every day
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.400]   with the same decision if we're going to live within,
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.320]   if we're gonna live out the truest thing about us.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.160]   - That's good.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.560]   - I think there are a lot of people here
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.480]   that wherever they are with respect to this issue
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.240]   would say, "Yes, like, I want that.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.040]   "Like, I want to live out the truest aspect of my identity,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.440]   "but God, why won't you make that easier?"
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.840]   Like, there's some people here that have surely prayed,
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.680]   Brenna, what I'm sure is the prayer you've prayed yourself,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.000]   which is like, "God, why won't you take this away?"
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.880]   What would you say to the person that is praying
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.040]   for God to take this away and it hasn't happened yet?
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.880]   - Yeah.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:18.520]   With all the examples I gave about broken orientations,
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:24.920]   in those orientations with those desires,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.160]   you can have those temptations without it being a sin,
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.400]   right, like we talked, we touched on that.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.200]   You can have a disordered sexual desire
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.320]   without giving into this.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.760]   And I think it's first really important to ask,
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.120]   where do we see that in the biblical text?
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.360]   If it's true, where do we see that?
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.400]   In both Matthew 4, one through 11,
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.560]   and then Luke 4, one through 13, it says,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.840]   "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.880]   "to be tempted by the devil."
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.520]   So the first question is, did Jesus sin?
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.600]   No.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.600]   The second question is, was Jesus tempted?
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:15.200]   And in Galatians, it says, "But the fruit of the Spirit
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.240]   "is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.600]   "faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.160]   "Against such things there are no law."
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.160]   And so there's this argument that lives
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   within some faith cultures that say,
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   same-sex attracted people need to see a decrease
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.240]   or a complete removal of their same-sex attraction
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.920]   or temptation in order to lead in the church
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.920]   or even to be seen as spiritually healthy or mature.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.000]   And I don't see that in the text.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   What I do see is this sign for spiritual health
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   and maturity that is the Holy Spirit
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.900]   is taking over more of your thoughts
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.840]   and more of your actions,
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.880]   and that is what we define as self-control.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.080]   And so I think it's interesting that in this case,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.240]   with this thought, the fruit of the Spirit isn't
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   and the diminishing of temptation, but self-control,
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   indicating that if these things persist,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.680]   so if you've been praying for your same-sex attraction
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.680]   to be taken away and it hasn't been and it persists,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.800]   or even if there are seasons where the temptation grows,
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.920]   that in itself does not disqualify you.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.560]   The question doesn't lie in what is the percentage
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.200]   of your current temptation,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   but rather what is your dependence on the Holy Spirit?
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.880]   Christ was greatly tempted.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.800]   Now I love, in Philippians, it's 2, 6 through 8,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.240]   it says, "Who being in very nature God
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.740]   "did not consider equality with God
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.620]   "something to be used to his own advantage.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.500]   "Rather, he made himself nothing
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.980]   "by taking the very nature of a servant
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.980]   "being made in human likeness,
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.720]   "and being found in appearance as a man,
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.000]   "he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.640]   "even death on a cross."
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   So there's this complex theological idea happening here
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.160]   that Jesus, while retaining his full divinity,
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.720]   set aside the privilege of his divinity and deity,
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   and Christ assumes humanity to his divinity.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:06.800]   So the reason why this matters is that people hear
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.280]   that Christ was tempted,
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.200]   and it's easy for us to assume
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   it didn't have any weight on him because of his deity,
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.280]   but here Christ sets that aside.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   And so Christ not sinning when he was tempted
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:35.480]   is not like an athlete using steroids.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.400]   I think that's often the thought.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.480]   He has this superhuman extra boost,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.240]   but Christ not sinning, what it's actually like
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.520]   in the face of temptation, is more like an athlete
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   who has chosen not to consume ultra-processed food.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.160]   He didn't use a superhuman ability.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.960]   It's actually that he chose not to participate
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.600]   in the sin that degrades humanity,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.080]   doling out and dampening the leading
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.680]   of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.880]   And so if that's true, if Christ being fully God
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.800]   stepped into being also fully human,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   we have to ask how did he face such horrific temptation
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.520]   and do it faithfully?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.320]   And the answer we see is in the beginning
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.640]   of all four Gospels, which is when Jesus is baptized,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.120]   he comes out of the water, and what happens?
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.320]   The Holy Spirit descends on him.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   And the crazy thing is that gift is available
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.880]   to all of us, and so if you have been praying
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.440]   for God to take this temptation away from you,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.780]   and Kylan already said it, but I have prayed that prayer.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.320]   There were four years of my life
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   where I prayed that prayer every single night.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.220]   You need to know that if his answer is no,
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.380]   or if his answer is not yet,
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.380]   that the Holy Spirit was not just sufficient,
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.340]   but immeasurably more for Christ,
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.620]   and therefore is immeasurably more for you,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.780]   no matter what your temptation is.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.740]   And I love in Corinthians, Paul addresses temptation.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.740]   In the first part, he just says,
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.380]   "No temptation has overtaken you
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.020]   "except what is common to man."
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.940]   And in that part, he's saying,
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.940]   "If you are tempted, no matter what it is, it's normal."
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.960]   You might have the thought in your brain
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.860]   that you're like, oh, no one else struggles with this.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:05.740]   And that is a tool of Satan to keep you isolated
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.260]   from sharing in community.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.900]   Your temptation is not unique to you.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.180]   Everyone has struggled with something.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.580]   And then Paul goes on and says,
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.880]   "And God is faithful.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.380]   "He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear,
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.540]   "but when you are tempted,
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.540]   "he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it."
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:32.700]   This is written to the church in Corinth.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.300]   Corinth is a huge port city
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   that is inundated with sexual misconduct.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.660]   One of the main things that took place in Corinth
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.340]   was temple worship.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.240]   And one of the main temples there
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.380]   was the Temple of Aphrodite.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.420]   And the way you worshiped in that temple was through sex.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:02.420]   Any and every sexual engagement you can imagine
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.780]   was taking place in the city.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.780]   Now, also, this was not frowned upon.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.340]   This was widely known.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:18.300]   And if you came into money in this point in time,
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.020]   it would be a very normal brag and thing to do
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   to say, I am going to worship at the Temple of Aphrodite.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.020]   And everyone knew what you were talking about.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.220]   But Paul is talking to a church
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.860]   that has been established in this very city.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.980]   And he's saying these things
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.720]   because earlier he talks about this list of sins
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.780]   that I think many of us have heard,
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.380]   including sexual immorality and homosexuality,
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.220]   and he's saying,
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.380]   as some of you once were,
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.820]   and I love that phrase
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.140]   because it's like Paul is writing to this church
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:10.020]   remembering before you loved God,
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.860]   you were worshiping at this temple every single night.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.940]   And so you can imagine,
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.880]   we've all struggled with temptations
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.780]   that we needed to seek accountability for.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.980]   And I think a lot of the times accountability for us
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.500]   includes removal or distance.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.380]   You can imagine being people in Corinth
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.020]   who struggled with those things,
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.460]   who came to know the Lord,
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.080]   and then decided we have to be Christians in this city.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.500]   And what temptation that would present itself.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.840]   That every single day you are seeing
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.060]   the people of your past life that you used to live with.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.340]   And they're probably saying,
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.820]   hey, why don't you just come join us again?
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.860]   Hey, what happened?
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.580]   Hey, why aren't you going out with us?
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.180]   And Paul doesn't say,
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.620]   yeah, get up and leave the city.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.620]   He says, the Holy Spirit is sufficient for you.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.860]   So I think we have to understand
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.060]   that our temptation is understood
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:30.480]   because Christ was tempted.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   And we are not left to ourselves to battle ourselves.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.980]   We have the Holy Spirit to lean on in that.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:47.980]   - I can imagine the thought of
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.500]   daily surrendering, right?
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:01.300]   Constantly, consistently, continually taking my desires
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.560]   and putting them at the altar can feel like,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.860]   okay, here I go again.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.460]   I'm always having to give something up
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.460]   in order to get you, Jesus.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.220]   I'm always having to give something over
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.180]   in order to receive the kind of life you want.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.100]   And it can feel really taxing.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.260]   TA, we were talking a little bit about this earlier today.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.360]   And so I'd love to just ask if you could speak briefly
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.900]   into why is, surrender is not,
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:27.860]   it's not a disincentivizing proposition.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.040]   Like it's actually a great invitation.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   Why is that?
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.100]   Like why is it that when I surrender myself to Jesus,
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.180]   it's not just I'm giving over, I guess what I want.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.640]   It's actually instead a really beautiful exchange.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:47.700]   - Yeah, we always think of surrender as giving something up,
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.860]   which it is.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.440]   It's laying our lives down.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.020]   The call is to come and die.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.880]   And yet so often we're looking at what we have to give up
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.020]   and we're never looking at what we actually get to embrace.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.660]   And so, like if you struggle with some same sex attraction
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.140]   in Brenna, this is where you can help,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.420]   but you're not just constantly saying,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.020]   I don't get to have that.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.420]   Like there has to, and this isn't just
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.000]   for same sex attraction.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   This is for any desire that is contrary
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.660]   to what God wants for you right now.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.660]   So it's so easy to just focus on what God is asking you
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.100]   to give up instead of what he's inviting you to embrace.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:42.020]   And I think the reality is that,
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   the reality is that God wants us to be satisfied in him.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.700]   He wants us to be satisfied in him.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.340]   I was talking with a friend earlier
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.880]   and we were talking about this,
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.560]   we were talking about same sex attraction,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.000]   same sex relationships.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.280]   And one of the ways he put it was,
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.100]   in this circumstance, God has told us no.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.340]   And he related it to his kids.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.640]   Like if his kids ask for something
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.840]   and he tells them no, like,
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.320]   hey dad, I wanna go and spend the night
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.420]   at this person's house.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.480]   I know you want to, but you can't.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.320]   The answer is no.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.020]   But dad, I really want to.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.380]   Yeah, but the answer is no.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.560]   But dad, you don't understand.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.220]   No, I do understand, but the answer is no.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.740]   And a question that he's asked his kids is,
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.740]   what is keeping you from letting me tell you no?
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.380]   Which I think is a really interesting question.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.580]   Like, what's keeping you from letting me tell you no?
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.340]   And I think what it comes down to,
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.060]   and this is just the Christian life.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.680]   One of the reasons that we have a hard time
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   letting God tell us no is that we aren't convinced
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.780]   that if we let him tell us no,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   that in the end he will be good enough in himself for us.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.680]   And that's for all of life.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.700]   Like, there's gonna be times in our lives
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.140]   where God tells us no.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.220]   That you might be battling chronic pain,
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.220]   and you pray for healing, and God tells you no.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.780]   And we, our tendency is to say,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.240]   well then God isn't good because he doesn't heal.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.760]   And yet, what if it is through that pain
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.620]   that God wants you to taste and see that he's good
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.500]   in a way that you wouldn't if he did just
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.340]   heal you like that?
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.100]   And so that's where we all, as followers of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.360]   that's what faith looks like.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.260]   If we just wanna boil it down,
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:56.260]   faith in Christ is believing that God is good enough
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:03.100]   to tell you no and to give you himself,
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.020]   and it makes that no good.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.060]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.860]   I remember I had a seminary professor
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.500]   who once said, and I think I've shared this in here before,
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.940]   but God will lead you places you would not go
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.520]   to teach you things you need to know.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.340]   And I was like, well that sounds horrible.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.660]   Can't you find another way to teach me, God?
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.740]   There's a litany of things that he wants to teach you.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.620]   Some of you, it's not even in this issue,
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.580]   but it's in some area of suffering or difficulty right now,
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.260]   and you need to know, man, God is trying to teach you
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.620]   more about himself by way of whatever that thing is.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.620]   But, and I think, T.A., you just summarized it perfectly,
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.740]   what God is trying to lead you to
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.000]   is the knowledge that he's better.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.940]   It's not even like, I guess he's good enough.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.380]   It's that he is better.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.060]   He's better than whatever else it is you want.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.940]   Now, some people here that are struggling
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.140]   with same-sex attraction or finding themselves
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.500]   in even potentially a same-sex relationship would say,
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.780]   okay, but can't I have my cake and eat it too?
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.700]   Can't I walk with Jesus and also continue
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.060]   to be in a same-sex relationship?
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.380]   And Brenna, I would love if you could speak to that question
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.260]   'cause I think that that's probably
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.660]   the most important question we could ask tonight
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.180]   is is it possible to be in a same-sex relationship
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.140]   and still live a Christian life?
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.140]   And I just wanna give you permission.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.100]   You can take as much time as you want on this one
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.420]   because I think that this one is,
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.680]   it deserves as much time as you think it actually needs.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   So what do you think?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.100]   Is it possible to be in a same-sex relationship
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.140]   and still live a Christian life?
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.860]   - Yeah, this is where I took the most time with my notes.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.620]   So we're gonna go down a rabbit trail
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:51.420]   because I think it's extremely important
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.060]   that we actually do the work.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.860]   - We're good with that, yes?
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.420]   All right, let's go, let's do it.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.300]   - So I would wager a high percentage of people in this room
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.580]   already had an answer to that question
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.140]   in your head when you asked it.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.140]   What I would not wager is the percentage of yes versus no
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:19.460]   because for those of us in this room
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.900]   who are between the ages of 20 and 30,
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:27.900]   we've already established that this is a personal question.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:33.300]   We either love someone who's same-sex attracted,
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.420]   we are someone who is same-sex attracted,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.700]   or we've been confronted about our beliefs on sexuality
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.700]   because someone knows that we at least frequent church.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.420]   And so already there are layers to this question
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.940]   that I think deserves walking through.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:57.940]   So the first layer is what is a Christian life?
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.460]   What is a Christian life?
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.460]   There are plenty of Christians who are in
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.220]   what I would call habitual sin.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.900]   They're having sex outside of marriage,
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.620]   they are chronically domineering,
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.620]   they're intrinsically greedy.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.340]   We all have heard the stories
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.620]   or maybe have been personally impacted by pastors
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:28.620]   who are harsh or quarrelsome or abusive.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.260]   And what's confusing is that you can appear on the outside
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:41.060]   as someone who loves Jesus.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.020]   You can go to church every Sunday,
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.940]   you can know the Bible, you can even preach the Bible
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.620]   and talk about what it says, but so deceive yourselves,
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   as it says in James, into thinking that Christianity
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:03.180]   is a list of actions weighed.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.420]   It's a checklist that you have to go through
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:10.340]   when really that thought that I just have to show up
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.500]   to church, read my Bible, do these things,
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.940]   is either just a product of religious guilt,
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.700]   which is not a fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.700]   We are compelled by love and relationship
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.900]   to do those things, not compelled by guilt
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.340]   or something you were taught or shamed into.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:42.340]   Or those actions are the guise of moral superiority
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.060]   and both groups miss the fact that it is not
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.980]   about prescriptions but compelled by Christ's radical love.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.860]   So you can be a cultural Christian and reasonably
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.860]   or even unknowingly unsubscribe to whatever parts
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:06.940]   of the text that don't satisfy or serve your flesh
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:13.220]   because you are not being ruled by the Holy Spirit,
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:17.180]   but rather being deceived that relationship
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:22.140]   with Christ is only moral obligation.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.180]   But to follow Jesus, that's a whole 'nother story.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.940]   I love in Mark chapter two, Jesus is walking
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.500]   with a crowd and he's teaching them.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.260]   And up along the way, they see Levi, the tax collector,
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.060]   and tax collectors were greatly hated
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.380]   by the Jewish majority because they were seen as traitors
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.140]   because they were raised Jewish
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.100]   and decided to start working for Rome
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   and they would often use their power of working for Rome
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.660]   to abuse their fellow Jews by taking more money.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.060]   And so I can imagine as this crowd is walking with Jesus,
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.460]   they see this tax collector up in front of them
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.460]   and they're thinking, Jesus is going to call this guy out
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.540]   because he is living in sin.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.620]   He is daily abusing the people of God.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.900]   So that thought makes sense when they're walking
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.860]   with this teacher who's known
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.940]   for some pretty radical interactions.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.780]   But what happens I think is not only shocking
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.420]   to the Jewish people who were with Jesus at the time,
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:40.420]   but probably deeply shocking to Levi as well.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.620]   And Christ walks to him and says two words, follow me.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:53.380]   And when you read ahead, you get to this part
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.500]   where it says Jesus is eating with sinners
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.820]   and tax collectors and you have to be thinking,
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.820]   how did he get there, right?
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.180]   Like, how did he get in this company?
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:11.180]   And I can't help but think that when the people in the town
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.900]   who were also on the outskirts of the religious majority,
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.460]   the people who have been shamed and beaten
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.420]   or mocked or disregarded,
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   when they saw that Jesus approached Levi with compassion
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:36.060]   and not condemnation, that maybe they thought
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:41.340]   maybe this Jesus also wants to see me too.
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:45.140]   And so they have a meal together
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.700]   where Jesus gets to present himself the light
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.100]   and truth to these people.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.100]   Now, the interesting thing is that following Jesus
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:04.060]   required Levi to decide to never go back to the church.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:09.060]   He decided to never go back to that tax booth.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:14.220]   The tax booth that he built,
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.420]   that was a place of comfort and ease
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.860]   and a good life that served his flesh.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.860]   Levi could not follow Jesus
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:31.860]   if he did not leave that life behind.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.220]   That was the decision.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.540]   It's not just for those who are same-sex attracted.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.100]   I think we've all built tax booths that we've dwelt in,
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.780]   that we've found comfort in, that we've benefited from.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.780]   But to follow Jesus means to leave our self-desires
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.980]   behind us, understanding that following Christ
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.340]   on the narrow road leads us away from self-satisfaction,
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.220]   self-reliance and self-worship.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.260]   But it also leads us closer and closer to the object
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.980]   of our affection and devotion.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:09.980]   And the way that this walking, the narrow path,
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:15.500]   is described in the biblical text is first self-sacrifice.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.340]   In Romans 12, when it says,
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.060]   "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:25.060]   "in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:29.860]   "as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God,
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.940]   "this is your true and proper worship."
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.820]   And it is also self-crucifixion.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.860]   Luke 9, 23 says, "And he said to all,
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:45.540]   "if anyone would come after me, let him deny himself
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.460]   "and take up his cross daily and follow me."
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.060]   And then in Galatians 5, it says,
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.700]   "So I say, walk by the Spirit,
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.500]   "and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.500]   I find that people are commonly willing to accept
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.340]   that life with Jesus includes some amount
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.740]   of personal sacrifice, especially in places
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.260]   that match areas of secular moralism,
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.580]   like expending your time or your money
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.740]   or your talents for other people.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.620]   But it is much harder to accept the idea
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.660]   that sacrifice in a crucified life
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.660]   would mean denying self-pleasure.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:39.780]   So that's the second layer, is in your life,
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:46.020]   who gets to define right and wrong?
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   Oftentimes, there's this interjection
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.680]   that says, "I'm caring for the oppressed,
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.120]   "I'm loving my neighbor, I'm even turning the other cheek."
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.680]   But these verses couldn't possibly mean
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.000]   denying myself the desire I feel
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.560]   if it isn't harmful to any other person involved.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.400]   Right, if it's monogamous and loving,
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.160]   it can't mean that I would have to deny myself that.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.040]   And Dr. Preston Sprinkle says,
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.360]   "The same Lord who said, 'Love everyone,'
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.140]   "also said, 'Don't lust, don't worry, don't hate,
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.500]   "'don't fornicate, don't be greedy, don't retaliate,'
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.940]   "and a whole host of other things that confronted,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.520]   "not reaffirmed our desires.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:45.520]   "The love everybody argument rightly prioritizes love,
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.280]   "but wrongly defines it.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:53.000]   "Jesus tells us to love one another as I have loved you."
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.160]   And that last part is important.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.260]   When Jesus loved his disciples,
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.920]   he didn't always or usually affirm
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.140]   their behaviors or desires.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:08.200]   It's worldly love, not Christian love,
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.700]   that says, "Because I love you,
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.440]   "I'll affirm everything you desire to do
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.480]   "and everything you believe to be true about yourself."
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.160]   So the true recognition within these scriptures
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.480]   that talk about a crucified life
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   is they aren't being spoken vaguely.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.900]   They are attached to an entire body of God-breathed,
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.720]   inerrant, infallible scripture.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.900]   So that means God makes it known to us
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.600]   what walking on the narrow path looks like.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.640]   In John 14, Jesus tells his disciples,
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.640]   "Hey, if you love me, keep my commands."
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:59.600]   And James, I love how frankly James writes.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   He says, "Do not merely listen to the word
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.080]   "and so deceive yourselves.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.160]   "Do what it says."
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:14.160]   So now we ask, what does the text say
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.120]   about sex, about romantic relationships,
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.820]   and about fornication?
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.420]   That's the third layer.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.860]   And one of the answers I often hear is,
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.380]   Jesus had no framework
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.220]   for loving, monogamous, same-sex relationships.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.280]   And so that's why Jesus never mentions
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.580]   same-sex relationships,
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.780]   but only mentions same-sex abuse.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.140]   And the first thing to note
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.140]   is that adult men abusing teenage boys was common
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:50.420]   and also clearly condemned in ancient Jewish writings.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:55.420]   However, there is also evidence in Jewish authors,
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.780]   that Jewish authors disapproved of all forms
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.060]   of same-sex sexual relations,
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:07.400]   not just exploitative ones.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.400]   We have a handful of ancient letters that say that,
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:18.840]   that reference also consensual same-sex acts
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   without any indication of coercion or pedophilia
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.000]   showing a broader disapproval.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.040]   And then often in the church,
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.200]   pastors will quote Josephus.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.120]   So for example, Josephus condemns same-sex relationships
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.520]   in the context of marriage,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.700]   emphasizing a natural male-female union.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.200]   So one,
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:51.580]   the Bible's not just talking about abusive relationships
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.880]   or harmful relationships.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.880]   And two, the question of same-sex monogamy in marriage,
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.240]   Jesus doesn't name that
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.400]   because whenever he's talking about marriage,
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.920]   it's assumed that he is upholding the God-ordained covenant
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.800]   that marriage inherently involves
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.200]   what has been cited and said in Genesis.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.040]   In other words, Jesus is always affirming
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.480]   what God has already spoken.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.160]   So we can see that same-sex relationships
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.520]   were known in Jesus's time.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.920]   It was not uncommon within the Roman Empire culture.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.080]   There was Roman emperors that,
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.480]   two of them specifically during Jesus's time
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.080]   that had very public wedding ceremonies with men
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.840]   and many historical sources that talk about this.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.840]   So all that means Jesus's rejection
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.000]   of same-sex relationships was not limited
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.760]   to abusive and non-consensual acts
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   because all of it existed in his time.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   He would have specified if there was one facet
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:10.360]   of a same-sex relationship that was God-ordained.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.640]   And while Jesus doesn't explicitly name
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.020]   same-sex relationships when you look through the text,
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.580]   first of all, Paul does.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.440]   It's in there.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.400]   He talks about it in Romans.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.840]   He talks about it in Corinthians.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.520]   And he also talks about it in 1 Timothy.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.640]   And then in Matthew and in Mark,
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.520]   Jesus, we see him use the Greek term porneia,
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.960]   which generally means sexual misconduct
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:43.800]   that is outlined in Leviticus, talking about moral law.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.040]   So porneia is a catch-all term translated for us
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.460]   in our Bibles as sexual immorality.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.480]   And then while Jesus doesn't explicitly
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.040]   name same-sex relationships,
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.960]   we see that God does in Old Testament law.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   He does that in Leviticus 18.22 and Leviticus 20.13.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:10.200]   So the text does address same-sex desires.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.600]   And this is where we often hear about the next question,
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.400]   which is, okay, they talk about it in the Old Testament,
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:27.440]   but didn't Jesus show up and do away
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.520]   with Old Testament law?
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.520]   So there's some nuance to be understood here.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.920]   'Cause I think when we see arguments in the public space
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:41.360]   about same-sex relationships, we often see people say,
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.040]   well, you eat shellfish and you wear clothes
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.680]   that have different kinds of material woven into them.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.280]   And so there's an understanding of what the laws are
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.560]   and what is continued.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.360]   So Christ fulfilled the sacrificial system
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.240]   through his death and resurrection.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   So ceremonial sacrificial laws have been met,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.600]   but that doesn't mean they have been undone.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.000]   They've been fulfilled through Christ's actions,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.820]   which is why we no longer slaughter animals.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.360]   Moral law is a different kind of law.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:29.360]   And moral law is an expression of God's very character.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.880]   That when we look at the moral law,
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.200]   it's for those of us who serve him,
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.120]   we need to represent his character.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.960]   So we should not be falling into adultery
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.400]   or idol worship or murder or theft.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.440]   And God expands on this with the Israelites,
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.760]   specifically in Leviticus.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.560]   And so the question is, what did Jesus do
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.160]   with the moral law?
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.440]   When you read through the gospels,
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.880]   you can see in the three years
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.280]   of Jesus's earthly ministry,
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   he consistently pulls out and represents
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.720]   Old Testament moral law,
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.760]   often clarifying the misintentions
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.240]   by the Jewish majority.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.960]   So he says, hey, you've taken this thing
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.960]   and you've twisted it and you've created loopholes
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.560]   because you do not understand that this is for your benefit,
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.960]   therefore carrying over a decent amount
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.760]   of Old Covenant morality and obedience laws
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.360]   to the New Covenant.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:45.680]   In Matthew 19, Jesus improves upon divorce.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:50.680]   And in Matthew 5, Jesus is preaching the Sermon on the Mount
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:54.600]   and we get a deeply clarifying picture of this
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.920]   because he says, this whole entire time,
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   you've thought that it is only about murder,
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.440]   but I actually care about the hatred
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.680]   welling up in your heart.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.400]   And this whole time, you thought it was only
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.680]   about intercourse and I actually care
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.440]   about how you look at someone
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.520]   and what you think about in your head
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.280]   and in your heart towards other people's bodies.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   And you only go so far as to love your neighbor,
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   but what it's actually about is the radical love
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.040]   that transforms you, that would make you able
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:44.040]   to love your enemy and pray for those who harass
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.480]   and mistreat you.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.480]   Jesus takes the moral law and says,
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.760]   you've missed the point.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:53:01.160]   It's not about the checklist, it is about the heart of God
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.920]   being conveyed to the people around you.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.960]   And I think it's pretty incredible
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:17.200]   that the way Christ fulfills this moral law
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.080]   is again by giving us the Holy Spirit
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.080]   so that we can actually have the ability to obey,
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.680]   not set aside.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.480]   This is foreshadowed in Ezekiel.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.320]   He says, I will give you a new heart
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.960]   and put a new spirit in you and I will remove
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.760]   from you a heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.200]   and I will put my spirit in you and move you
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.960]   to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.520]   So the moral laws given in the Old Testament
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.240]   surrounding sexuality and marriage not only carry over,
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.640]   but Christ both raises the bar and enables us
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:03.320]   to be obedient to them by sending the Holy Spirit.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   So after we've walked through all of this,
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.600]   the question is, is it possible to be
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.600]   in a same-sex relationship and still follow Jesus?
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:24.800]   And the answer, and I need you to hear this again,
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:30.640]   that this is a girl who realized she was gay
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.520]   when she was 14 years old, who prayed for four years
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.720]   to be made straight, who realized
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.000]   that probably isn't going to happen.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:49.560]   The answer I've found myself unearthing
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   from the biblical text is no.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:58.880]   I cannot bow to the God of my sexual desires
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.840]   while also bowing to Jesus.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.120]   It doesn't work.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:12.120]   Every time Paul talks about the sin of same-sex relations,
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.120]   he clearly communicates that habitual,
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.800]   unrepentant pursuit of our desires
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.760]   results in separation from God.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:28.480]   But we also have to acknowledge
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:35.800]   we are quick to forget every other person
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:41.920]   listed and named by Paul.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:47.240]   And the church has unequally called out
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:51.720]   those in same-sex relationships outside of the church
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   while it has also placated those who are greedy,
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:02.320]   who cope unhealthily, who habitually gossip,
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.560]   who are harsh and not gentle,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.600]   and those who abuse within the church,
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:13.280]   instead of also urging them to repent
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:18.280]   lest they go from the pews or the pulpit straight to hell.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.320]   So while you cannot be in a same-sex relationship
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:28.320]   and actively follow Christ on the narrow road,
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:34.600]   you also cannot be a jerk and follow Christ.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:42.440]   We are all in desperate need
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.240]   of the transforming work of the Holy Spirit in our lives
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   in order to submit and sacrifice our desires
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:58.040]   in exchange for life on the narrow path with Christ.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:04.120]   And I think one of the most compelling things to me
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:11.680]   is a relationship with Jesus is the only situation in life
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   where the prize at the end also walks with us
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.200]   the entire way there.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.640]   - That's really good, Brenna.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.160]   Can we just respond to that real quick?
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.320]   [audience applauding]
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:39.760]   You know, when we were stepping
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.400]   into this conversation tonight,
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.440]   I just knew so frequently whenever this conversation
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.360]   is discussed from church platforms,
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:57.260]   it's often done at one end of the spectrum or the other.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.800]   It's done under the banner of truth,
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   which ends up leading to an insensitivity,
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.480]   religious bigotry, and bullying
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.280]   about people that are deeply struggling
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.960]   with something that is not just theoretical,
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:16.040]   it's very personal to them.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.000]   But then the other side is a group
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.520]   that wildly advocates for grace,
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.440]   even to the point that they would redefine
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.040]   the Christian sexual ethic.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:31.720]   The voice you don't often hear speaking into this issue
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.480]   is the voice that I hope you've heard tonight.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.200]   It's a much more nuanced voice
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.240]   that grabs hold of truth in one hand
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.480]   and grabs hold of grace in the other hand
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.240]   and brings them to the center in the person of Jesus
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.480]   and says, "This is a man full of conviction
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.580]   "that there is a way to walk with God,
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.580]   "but he is simultaneously full of compassion,
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.780]   "that he, the prize which awaits you
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.680]   "at the end of your life, will walk with you
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.840]   "as you make your way towards him."
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.200]   Brenna, thank you for just helping us
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.280]   navigate the nuance of this.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   (congregation applauding)
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280]   So beautiful.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:20.920]   And not just unpacking it theologically,
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.960]   but really sharing yourself with us.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.720]   T.A. always says, "God hasn't given us a story to hide,
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.320]   "he's given us a story to tell."
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.760]   And we're really grateful that he has given you your story
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.120]   and that you're willing to tell it to all of us.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.080]   T.A., would you be willing to just pray for us
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.320]   as we close this time,
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.520]   and then I'll share some announcements
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.440]   and we can dismiss.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.400]   - I'm gonna pray, but let me just say this,
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:49.400]   just as a pastor here who believes so strongly
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.200]   in what God is doing right now
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.480]   in the lives of young adults,
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.600]   like this right here, what's happening on Tuesday nights
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.620]   is my favorite thing that is happening on this campus.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.240]   Like I love this place.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.940]   Like any chance I get to come here, I wanna be here
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.160]   because I believe that what God is doing here
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.440]   is so important.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.000]   But we have just had the privilege of sitting here,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.320]   Brenna, how old are you?
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.160]   - 29.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.480]   - She's 29, is a young adult.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:23.160]   And did you see how her life has been shaped by God's work?
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:29.080]   Like I don't know how many scriptures she just shared,
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.240]   but everything she just shared
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.400]   was so rooted in the word of God.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.320]   And I just wanna speak that into your lives
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.600]   and say that can be you too.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.240]   Like if you want, you can know the word of God like that.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.760]   Like your life can be transformed by the power of the Spirit
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.720]   with the word of God in your hands.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.560]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.520]   - So I just wanna, I believe in you.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.720]   I really do.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.280]   Like this whole idea of the Gen Z,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.840]   it's biblically illiterate,
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.880]   I'd say, well, I'm looking at a room full of people
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.080]   that have a hunger for God,
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.360]   so let me just say, you know what?
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   Like I'll read this comment and then I promise I'll pray.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.760]   But you know--
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.720]   - That's fine, man.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.560]   - Just think about--
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.000]   - Do what you wanna do, you know?
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.840]   - God in his kindness has given us his word.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.800]   But then just to speak to,
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.640]   Brenna mentioned the Holy Spirit so many times.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:34.440]   And Paul says in Ephesians chapter one,
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.400]   that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.080]   the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.520]   and of revelation and the knowledge of him,
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.080]   having the eyes of your heart enlightened,
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.680]   that you may know what is the hope to which
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.520]   he has called you,
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.840]   what are the riches of his glorious inheritance
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.360]   in the saints, and watch this, don't miss this,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.360]   and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.120]   towards us who believe according to the working
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.680]   of his great might that he worked in Christ
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.400]   when he raised him from the dead
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.560]   and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly place
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.680]   as far above all rule and authority and power
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.120]   and dominion and above.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.160]   Okay, let me just tell you what that just said, okay?
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.800]   The same power that raised Christ from the dead
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.400]   is available to you.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.800]   If you go to Romans eight, you know what it tells you?
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   That power is actually the spirit of the living God
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.240]   that Christ asked the Father to give to us.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.720]   So so often we just live with this mindset of like,
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.040]   I'm a stereotypical single young adult male.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.240]   It's like no, if you're in Christ,
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.360]   you are a child of the God of the universe
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.360]   who has gifted you the spirit of Christ
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.560]   who just happens to be the power
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.200]   that raised Christ from the dead.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.000]   So you have the power.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.500]   (congregation applauding)
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:15.480]   And then I'll pray.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.560]   I'm just saying, hey, hey, friends, I'm just telling you,
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:26.280]   fully surrender to the identity that you have in Christ,
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.440]   being a child of God, and just watch what happens.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.280]   When you trust his word,
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.360]   and you surrender fully to God's spirit
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.520]   and his power at work in you, I'm just, I'm saying,
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.680]   that, Brenna's a model of that.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.080]   And I just say, man, I,
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:50.720]   just watch what happens, you know?
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.800]   Let me pray.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.640]   Let me pray.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:04:04.520]   Lord, I pray for every person in this room, God, we're,
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:11.840]   thank you that you're a God who's very personal, God,
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.600]   that you see every person in this room,
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.400]   you know every person's name.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.960]   Like your affection for every person in this room
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.440]   is very, very deep.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.280]   God, that in your love for us,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.840]   you would send your Son, and you, eternal Son of God,
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.520]   in love, would take on flesh,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.480]   and live perfectly in the midst of temptation,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.440]   the greatest temptation of which
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.200]   was to come down off the cross.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.320]   And yet you endured the cross, despising the shame.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.520]   And you conquered Satan, sin, and death
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.480]   through your resurrection.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.000]   And I just thank you that your saving grace
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.800]   is available to every person in this room.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.040]   I think about what John 1, 12 says,
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.200]   for as many as received him, he gave the right
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.040]   to become children of God.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.000]   I think about what 1 John 3, 1 says,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.360]   see what kind of love the Father has given to us,
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.920]   that we should be called children of God.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.520]   So I pray for a generation of young men and women
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.000]   who would truly believe that the truest thing about them
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.800]   is that you, God of the universe,
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.960]   looks at us as a perfect Heavenly Father,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.280]   and delights to call us your sons and daughters.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.960]   And you haven't left us to ourselves.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.600]   You haven't asked us to become something
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   that you are not willing to form us into by your Spirit.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.520]   And in your kindness, you've given us your words
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.840]   so that we can know your ways and walk in them, Lord.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.400]   So I pray that you'd raise up a generation
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.720]   of men and women who would cling to you, Lord.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.960]   And we're all on this journey together, Lord.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.240]   And I pray that we all would just live surrendered,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.000]   surrendering our sexuality to you.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.440]   The goal isn't heterosexuality, it's holy sexuality, Lord,
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.680]   that our lives would be defined by you.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.880]   So we need you, we love you, in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.360]   - Amen, Porch, would y'all do a great job
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.360]   of helping me thank T.A. and Brenna, thank you all.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.860]   (congregation applauding)
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:34.880]   Hey, we can also throw up those resources,
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.240]   if you don't mind.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.120]   I would love for y'all to see a few books
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.880]   that we would love to commend to you on this topic
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.240]   that Brenna has shared with us specifically
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.080]   that we think could be of great help to you.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.080]   These are listed right here behind me.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.560]   If you want more information on this topic,
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.720]   to become more theologically informed
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.880]   on engaging this topic around sexuality,
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.200]   these are wonderful resources.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.120]   And then I would love to commend to you another book,
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.760]   which is a book our friend Brenna authored herself.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.280]   It's a book called "Can I Say That?"
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   And it is all about asking difficult questions
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.720]   to and of Jesus.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.200]   It's available wherever you wanna buy books.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.400]   You also need to know that Brenna is going to be
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.080]   spending some time with us right after this
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.080]   in our equipping night, which is outstairs
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.960]   and up in the loft where she's gonna be unpacking,
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.240]   becoming a thinking and asking Christian.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.760]   We also wanna take a little bit of a moment
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.280]   and we wanna share with you that some of you
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.560]   have been coming around for a while,
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.040]   and we previewed this last week,
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.440]   but this Labor Day, we are taking time
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.880]   and going back out to Sky Ranch
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.600]   where we're going to be jumping into launch 2025.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.880]   I don't know how you feel about that.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.040]   We're pretty excited for it.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.720]   We wanted to stand here in front of you and say,
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.840]   if you don't have plans for Labor Day,
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.960]   or even if you do, you have our permission
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.880]   to bring whoever those plans are with
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.840]   out to Sky Ranch and join us for launch
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.920]   because it is going to be an amazing time.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.120]   You can check out more information
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.080]   at theporch.live/launch to get more information,
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.040]   but go ahead and mark your calendars
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.420]   because tickets drop on June 3rd.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.140]   Next week, we will be right back here
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.600]   continuing in our series, Revive,
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.320]   but until then, go in peace, to love and serve the Lord,
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.240]   and join us at Equipping Night.
