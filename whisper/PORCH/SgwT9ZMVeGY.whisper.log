[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:20.320]   - All right, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.160]   Welcome to my friends tuning in online
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.500]   at our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500]   We have tonight Porch Live, Des Moines, Porch, Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.800]   and Porch H-Town, Houston, Texas.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160]   And of course my friends in the room in Dallas tonight,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.300]   welcome to the Porch.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.720]   We are taking a break from any series tonight
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.940]   and you guys got me in a one-off message.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.440]   But before we get to that, if y'all don't know,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160]   when I teach, David usually takes the night off
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.680]   to be with his family and his kids.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.640]   He's up here every Tuesday.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   And so he takes that time or tonight,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600]   like tonight, he's speaking at a youth camp
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   and he always, every single time,
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.440]   and he loves the Porch so much,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280]   he gets up on Wednesday and he watches the message.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.080]   And so he's listening right now
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.920]   and he's probably surprised
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.400]   that I'm talking about him right now.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800]   And I'm talking behind his back
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.360]   because he would never ask me to do this,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   but I wanna celebrate DMARF tonight
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.820]   and I wanna honor that man because, wait, wait,
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.360]   we have a few things to celebrate.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.960]   Number one, I don't know if you know this,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.800]   but tonight, and if you don't know,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000]   David Marvin is the director here at the Porch, okay?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.440]   I'm like the second at bat and he's the home run, okay?
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.760]   And so David has been leading and serving here
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.280]   at the Porch for 12 years today.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   (congregation cheering)
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.400]   And so, I mean, David, thank you.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.520]   Thank you for neglecting hobbies and family
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.440]   and so many different things.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.280]   I mean, you love your family,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   but sometimes you need to be here and different things.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.320]   So you can pour into the young adults of this generation
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.720]   and we take that serious and we have so much gratitude.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.160]   The second thing I want to bring to your attention
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.460]   is our fearless leader, David Marvin,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.200]   is about to be an author.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   And he is releasing his first book called, drum roll,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.640]   "We're All Freaking Out and Why We Don't Need To."
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.480]   And this book is all about the topic of anxiety
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.080]   and mental health and depression
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.200]   and how it has just plagued our generation
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.480]   and how we as Christians are meant to be called
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.440]   to have a life marked by peace.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.460]   And he takes this book
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.720]   and he gives us practical wisdom principles
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.280]   founded in God's word of how we can fight anxiety,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.560]   fight depression.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.240]   And so tonight, and for those listening exclusively,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.320]   you get a special thing where you get to,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.920]   next slide, please.

[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.720]   And guys, David, I'm telling you,
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.400]   we believe in this resource.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.520]   He spent hours and hours writing this book
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.920]   because he believes in you guys.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.480]   And so we believe in it.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   So pre-order, can all of you get it?
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.440]   Is it reaching up there?
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.720]   Good, it's up there, you good?
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.480]   Balcony, I love the balcony.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.600]   You guys don't get enough love up there.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.640]   You guys rock.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.660]   So use that.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.660]   I want to keep it up long enough.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.000]   I think we're good.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.520]   But pre-order, it'll also be up on his Instagram,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.440]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.360]   But pre-order, we're all freaking out today.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.560]   DMARV, we love you, we honor you, and we're so thankful.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.200]   Can y'all give it up for David one more time?
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.680]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.560]   I'm so excited to watch how this book
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.640]   just impacts people all over the world.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.000]   And where that book is the perfect setup
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.700]   because where that book is all about the battle of the mind,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.880]   tonight, when David allows me to do this one-off messages,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   he pretty much just says,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.560]   "Hey, what has God just been putting on your heart recently?
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.800]   "Like, what are you excited about?
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.100]   "What just pours out of you?
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.880]   "What makes you come alive?"
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.400]   And tonight, I'm talking about not just the battle
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.120]   of the mind, but the battle that you and I
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.520]   and every single one of us are in.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.160]   I want to talk about something I'm very passionate about,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.800]   and it's the topic of spiritual warfare.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.080]   Spiritual warfare.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.120]   And some of you might not know what that means.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.240]   Spiritual warfare, basically, if you look in books
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.380]   in the Bible, like Ezekiel and Isaiah and Revelation,
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.200]   in those books, we learn kind of like
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.640]   in the beginning of the world,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.960]   God created the heavens and the earth,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.640]   and he filled the heavens with angels
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.120]   that were supposed to bring him glory.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.080]   But there was one angel that was known as Lucifer.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.440]   We now know him as Satan.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.960]   He was actually described as the most beautiful
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   of all the angels.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.280]   And because of that, he let his pride get to him.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.320]   And he wanted to elevate himself over God.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.160]   He wanted to be like God.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.360]   And so because of that, God said, "I had enough."
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.240]   He casted him down.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.700]   And there was about a third of the angels
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.200]   that who we now call Satan took with him.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.840]   And they're what we refer to as demons.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.960]   And the Bible talks about,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.240]   whether you're aware of this or not,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.200]   that you and I, every single day, are in a war.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.760]   We are in a battle that we call spiritual warfare,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.120]   that there is this spiritual realm all around us
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.880]   that if right now I could ask God, please don't, God,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.940]   but to reveal to us the war going on,
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.240]   I mean, we would just head running for the hills.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.420]   Because the reality is, is there is an enemy.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.560]   And his name is Satan.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.780]   And every single day, he has a mission.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.200]   And I am passionate about my friends and my generation
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.440]   knowing about what he's setting out to accomplish.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.360]   And I'm even more passionate about them knowing
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   what God wants to accomplish through them in light of that.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.920]   And so that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.800]   And we're gonna do that by looking at
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.340]   the book of Ephesians chapter six,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.760]   if you wanna turn there.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.600]   I'm gonna read the entire passage.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.120]   I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.400]   And we're gonna get started and see what Paul has to say
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.520]   about this topic of spiritual warfare,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.680]   writing to the church of Ephesus as he is imprisoned,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.280]   shackled in chains to a Roman soldier in Rome.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.440]   It's powerful stuff.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.000]   And I wanna say this right now.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.840]   Satan hates this message.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.560]   He doesn't want this message to take place tonight
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.360]   because his greatest weapon
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.200]   is your lack of awareness that he exists.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.000]   There's a quote, as I was studying from John Nicola
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.440]   that says, "The devil's greatest asset
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.160]   is the doubt people have about his existence."
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.120]   The devil's greatest asset is the doubt
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.040]   that people have about his existence.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.440]   And so he will do anything in this moment
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.600]   to distract you, to have someone text you,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.080]   to have thoughts from your day,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.560]   that crazy hectic day you had crossed your mind.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.920]   He wants to do anything he can in this moment
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.720]   to keep you from hearing this message tonight.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.000]   And so I ask you to pay attention
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.200]   and let's learn from Paul in Ephesians chapter six.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.280]   So here we go, verse 10.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.800]   "Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.040]   and in the strength of his might,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.360]   put on the whole armor of God
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.280]   that you may be able to stand
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.480]   against the schemes of the devil.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.900]   For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.620]   but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.320]   against the cosmic powers over the present darkness,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.880]   against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.960]   Therefore, take up the whole armor of God
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.240]   that you may be able to withstand in the evil day.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   And having done all to stand firm,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.640]   stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.080]   and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.600]   and as shoes for your feet,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.880]   having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.200]   in all circumstances, take up the shield of faith
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.680]   with which you can extinguish
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.040]   all the flaming darts of the evil one.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.760]   And take the helmet of salvation
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.220]   and the sword of the spirit,
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.640]   which is the word of God,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.940]   praying at all times in the spirit.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.360]   With all prayer and supplication to that end,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.640]   keep alert with all perseverance,
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.960]   making supplication for all the saints.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.320]   Tonight, I'm gonna call this message,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.920]   "This is How We Fight Our Battles"
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.960]   with this scripture right here, but let me pray first.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   Father, I ask right now in the name of Jesus,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.780]   in his mighty and matchless name,
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.880]   that you would push out any force of evil
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.840]   that would wanna hinder this message.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.200]   I pray right now, Jesus,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.080]   that you would come and you would move in our hearts.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.440]   Holy Spirit, would you come and have your way
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.200]   on your sons and daughters?
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.440]   I pray that there are scales covering eyes tonight
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.200]   that they would fall off right now.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.880]   If there are things plugging the ears
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.200]   to keep people from hearing of your love and goodness,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.000]   would you remove it?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.780]   If there's any distractions, would you take it away?
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.720]   We invite you, Holy Spirit, and in your power
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.840]   and in your authority to come and speak.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.880]   If there's anything that's not of you tonight,
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.780]   would you get rid of it?
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.000]   Would you be glorified?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.280]   It's your name that I pray, amen.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   I remember I was in sixth grade
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.120]   and my dad took me and some guys to this ranch out in,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.200]   what's it called?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.720]   Talco, Texas, the middle of nowhere.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.880]   I don't even know where it's at in the map, honestly.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.600]   And we are in these woods and he took me hunting.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.440]   We went hunting.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.540]   Normally when you go hunting in the evening,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.080]   you hunt until literally you can't see anything.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.280]   And then in the dark of the night,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.520]   it's just absolutely terrifying,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.840]   especially when you're like sixth grade,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.820]   you walk back to your truck.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.560]   And so as normal, I've been hunting a few times with my dad
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.120]   but I'd never been hunting in this place, Talco, Texas.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.760]   I'd never been hunting on this ranch.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.800]   And so I wasn't really aware of my surroundings.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.860]   I didn't really know what's going on,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.960]   but I just know that my dad knew the way to the truck.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.480]   So I'm trusting him and I'm walking
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.760]   and I'm stepping on leaves and I'm being all loud.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.840]   I'm not caring about anything.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.840]   And eventually I hear out of nowhere, this piercing,
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.960]   I'm talking piercing,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.760]   what sounds like a scream from a woman near me.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.780]   And I'm like, "Oh."
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.680]   And like, you know, like Shaggy,
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.480]   when he jumps in like Scooby-Doo's arms,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.920]   that's what I did to my dad.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.240]   And I'm like, "What was that?"
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.080]   And I'm thinking like,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.680]   he's gonna tell me some lady or whatever.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.320]   And he looks at me and he tells me,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.040]   "I don't wanna freak you out,
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.920]   but on this property,
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.160]   they have told us that there are mountain lions
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.560]   and they scream."
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   And I'm like, "We got screaming mountain lions in this mug?
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   Like, what are you talking about?"
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.720]   And I was like, "They climbed trees.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.200]   They got night vision."
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.720]   And suddenly, boom,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   everything about my pursuit to the truck changed.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.200]   I was walking faster.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.520]   I was more aware.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   I was more alert.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.360]   You got my 20?
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.200]   I'm like looking around,
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.560]   like, I mean, I am looking everywhere, searching.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.440]   And I start there because once my dad made me aware
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.740]   that there was a prowling enemy around,
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.160]   everything changed about my journey.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.840]   I'm talking, I became more alert.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.640]   I start looking for him.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   My awareness changed my journey in radical ways.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.440]   And I start there because like I said earlier,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.560]   I think so many of us go about our day today
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.980]   and we are unaware that we are in a war.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.940]   We don't really care that we are on the battlefield.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.320]   We don't really even know about our enemy.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.740]   And because of that, we are susceptible to his attacks.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.320]   We are susceptible to when he lies to us.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.040]   And you've been searching and longing
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.000]   and looking and desperate,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.140]   and you haven't found life
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.580]   and you have experienced true life
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.400]   because you haven't even known
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.040]   that someone's taking it from you.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.480]   And so tonight, we're gonna just start off in this text.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.520]   And Paul's gonna tell us,
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.080]   "Hey, if you're gonna win the war in spiritual warfare,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   you have to understand, learn, and know your enemy
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.240]   because he has taken time to learn and know you."
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.400]   And here's how he says to do that.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.560]   Just look at the text.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.680]   "In knowing your enemy,"
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   he says that we have to put on the whole armor of God
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.420]   that you may be able to stand
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.760]   against the schemes of the devil.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.060]   Most wars are lost
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.960]   because the enemy outwitted their opponent.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.680]   Like think about the Trojan horse.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.280]   They're like marching in.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.200]   They're like, "Oh, look, a great gift of a big horse."
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.920]   And then kicks down the walls and charge,
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.280]   and everyone dies
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.440]   because they weren't aware of what was taking place.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.640]   They weren't aware of what the enemy was doing.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.280]   And most wars are lost
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.840]   because the enemy in some way outwitted,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.240]   outsmarted their opponent.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.140]   I was talking to a friend yesterday
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.400]   and he was like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.040]   And I was telling him about this idea of how Satan,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.520]   we see, and you're gonna see here in a soon,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.080]   the scriptures, we see that Satan studies us
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.720]   and he does whatever he can to attack
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.560]   when we're most vulnerable.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.040]   And so how we as Christians have to know him,
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.080]   we have to search God's word and study him
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.540]   so that we can get on the offense,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.160]   we can get ahead of him.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.080]   And he's a quarterback.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.120]   And he looked at me and he was like, "JD,
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.100]   that's like my entire job."
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.240]   Like, sure, yeah, I'm on the offense on Saturday
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.060]   when I'm in the game.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.480]   It's like 10% of my job though.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.920]   Monday through Friday, I am watching film.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   I am studying my opponent.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.840]   I have no chance of winning this game
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.200]   if I don't study my opponent.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.720]   And they make him go and study every single down
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.560]   and watch every different play
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.200]   and every different formation.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.360]   And they had to even get into the personal details
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.440]   of their life.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.920]   They have to learn about who they're dating.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.980]   They have to learn about what they don't like,
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.240]   who they voted for, Trump or Biden.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.600]   I mean, they had to learn all these different things
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.560]   so they can mess with them
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.800]   and use it against them in the game.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.240]   I mean, it is absolutely insane.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.680]   He was just talking to me about,
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.600]   the reason why I have to do that
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.280]   is 'cause they're doing it against me.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.480]   They're coming to attack me in the game.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.940]   And I have no chance of winning
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.720]   if I don't understand my opponent's tactics.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.960]   That's the same for you and I.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.800]   Paul is saying here,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.400]   if you don't take time to wake up
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.960]   and realize that you have an enemy
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.360]   and learn him and know him and get ahead of him,
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.200]   you are gonna be susceptible to him every single time
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.840]   and you will lose the war.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.200]   You'll lose the daily battle.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.560]   You'll lose the fight against him.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.600]   And so he says here,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.120]   and the first thing that you do
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.440]   is that you put on the armor of God
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.980]   so that you can stand against the schemes of the devil,
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.240]   the schemes of the devil.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.080]   We see that since the beginning of the Bible,
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.240]   in Genesis three,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.680]   when God created man and woman
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.120]   and wanted them to dwell with him and gave them everything,
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.880]   we see that Satan was very crafty.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.600]   It says in Genesis three,
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.620]   that that beast, that the serpent, Satan,
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.440]   was more crafty than any other animals
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.600]   that the Lord God had made.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.960]   And he comes down and he just uses his craftiness
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.120]   to twist the words of God.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.320]   You've heard the story before,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.360]   where he tells them, did God really say?
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.860]   And the reason why I say that he's crafty and not creative
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.960]   is because Satan has had the same play
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.320]   since the very beginning.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.280]   He wants the same thing for you and I
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.360]   that he wanted for Adam and Eve.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.280]   He's not very creative.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.840]   He has one goal,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.880]   to get you to doubt God's goodness.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.360]   He doesn't want you to trust that God is actually for you.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.260]   That's his play.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.600]   Everything that you do in your life
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.040]   that you choose other than God
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.320]   is because something in you
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.320]   did not believe in that moment that God was actually good
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.840]   or God was actually worth it.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.280]   In that moment, your sins seem more appetizing than God
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.240]   because Satan tricked you.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.360]   He's crafty.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.240]   He's not creative.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.100]   However, he's crafty.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.640]   He schemes.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.800]   He looks for the right opportunity.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.280]   He learns you.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.800]   He studies us.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.600]   He waits for when you're most susceptible to attack.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.720]   And I want you to realize
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.800]   that when you think about the craftiness of Satan,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.600]   I'm not talking about the person that's out here
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.280]   like murdering people.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.800]   I'm not talking about the person that's out here just like,
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.520]   I mean, I can't help but think about the little Nas video
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.120]   with like, you know what I'm talking about
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.760]   if you've seen it, don't watch it.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.960]   But we laugh and joke.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.500]   And like, basically in this video,
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.680]   he just talks about how he has given himself over to Satan.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.800]   And he like, you know, he likes hell, hell's fun.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.920]   And there's so many people that are like,
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.800]   man, I guess I'm gonna be in hell with Satan.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.480]   I might as well smoke a blunt now.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.720]   And first off to you, I'd say you better watch yourself
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.640]   'cause that's not hell.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.280]   Hell is a place of torment
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.320]   and you won't be smoking a blunt in hell.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:24.760]   But, that wasn't in my notes.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.160]   Porch Twitter tonight's like,
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.760]   and you won't be smoking a blunt in hell, @JDRodgers.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:37.960]   But, think about this.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.360]   Satan is so crafty that why would he go over
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.120]   and like worry and give his time and attention
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.480]   to someone who's living for him?
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.880]   He doesn't need to.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.080]   And I think we think, oh, Satan's clearly on that person.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.960]   Look at how bad they're living.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   No, he's after you.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.600]   He comes after the good.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.440]   He hates that you're here right now.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.260]   He hates that you're hearing this.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.880]   He's coming after you.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.040]   And it's not often in the ways that you think.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.360]   He's coming in the secret.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.080]   He's coming into quiet.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.200]   And it's a slow fade that he draws you
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.480]   out of that intimate relationship with God.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.080]   And he gets you comfortable.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.760]   And he has you settle
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   in what was once a thriving intimate relationship.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.960]   Like, think about your relationship with God right now.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   Do you thirst for time with him?
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   Like, do you talk to him?
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.840]   Are you comfortable?
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.280]   When's the last time you shared your faith?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.440]   When's the last time you felt on mission for God?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.720]   The purpose, the sense of wonder
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.120]   that he would call you his son and his daughter.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.160]   Satan comes for the Christian.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.320]   He comes to the person who's interested.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.520]   So you and I are here because you're curious
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.680]   and you found yourself in a bad place.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.240]   And he's gonna do whatever he can to keep you there.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.280]   'Cause that's what he does.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.560]   But he's gonna do it in the most craftiest way.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   So be alert.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.240]   Watch film.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.040]   Study your opponent.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.320]   A way that we study our opponent
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.040]   is we read the word of God.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.520]   And as I read about Satan
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.720]   and as I learn about spiritual warfare,
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.440]   here's some obvious things I see that Satan does
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.080]   to make sure that we do not know that he is attacking us.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.600]   First, we see here in verse 12,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.920]   "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.800]   but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.440]   against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.240]   against the spiritual forces of evil
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.920]   in the heavenly places."
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.040]   We don't wrestle against flesh and blood,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.640]   but we wrestle and we fight and wage war
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.480]   against a spiritual realm.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.240]   That means that Satan is supernaturally
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.640]   in your superficial problem,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.920]   but he makes it superficial.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.440]   He makes it flesh and blood.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.080]   He's a master illusionist.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.160]   He's a magician.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.560]   Everyone knows that a good magician,
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.320]   after the end of their trick at the grand finale,
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.840]   everyone stands on their feet and they're like,
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.720]   "How did he do it?
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.840]   I was watching the whole thing.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.680]   I was right there.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.520]   I touched it.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.120]   How did that happen?"
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.680]   And everyone knows that the best illusionists
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.760]   are the people that can get you to focus
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.240]   all your energy here,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.880]   because if you focus all your energy here,
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.040]   you are not seeing a sleight of hand here.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.640]   And if he can get you to focus
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   and make you think that that person's your problem,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.520]   that that situation's your problem,
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.000]   that that sin is your problem,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.560]   that that relationship is your problem,
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.680]   that that church hurt is your problem.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.520]   If he can get you to focus on that social media post
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.440]   or whatever it is and divide you
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.120]   and create chaos in your life,
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.960]   he's winning.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.080]   And the whole time he's just masterfully
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.600]   hiding himself back here.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.040]   He's a master illusionist.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.560]   The division we see today in our culture
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.500]   is because people don't believe this verse.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.760]   The division we see across churches today
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.840]   and why churches don't feel safe for a lot of people
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.200]   is because churches stopped believing in this verse.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.760]   The reason why racism exists today
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.560]   is because people stopped believing in this verse.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.600]   There is an enemy who is seeking to divide man
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.780]   because he knows that when we are most unified,
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.120]   God is most glorified.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.040]   Therefore he makes it his mission to divide us.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.480]   And he's good at it.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.160]   Who in your life is he pulling you from?
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.000]   What roommate situation?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.960]   I mean, for me, it's like the dishes.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:38.120]   And like, you couldn't have just, you know, and.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.240]   And then suddenly that person walks in,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.440]   they've had a great day.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.680]   And they're like, what's up, man?
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.520]   Hey.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.760]   And then suddenly they do the next thing
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.440]   and the next thing and the next thing.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.040]   And then meanwhile, they're just living their life
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.420]   and you're over here bitter and upset
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.680]   and you're missing out on all the fun.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.840]   Because Satan has deceived you.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.000]   He's planted those thoughts in your head.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.400]   He's planted those lies in your head.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.340]   He's kept you from resolving that conflict
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.720]   because he wants you alone.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.560]   He wants you isolated because when he can go
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.240]   like the lion he is, 1 Peter 5, 8 says,
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.720]   "Be watchful, be sober-minded, be aware, be alert
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.880]   because your enemy, the devil, prowls around
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.000]   like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour."
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.920]   And we know that lions go after the sick.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.620]   Lions go after the weak.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.720]   Lions go after the separated or the baby,
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.920]   the one away from the herd.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.400]   And so the reason why he's passionate about dividing
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.560]   is because if he can get you isolated and alone,
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.420]   you are susceptible, you are vulnerable.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.120]   And that is when he attacks.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.740]   And so do whatever it takes to be unified.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.240]   Do whatever it takes to resolve conflict,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.840]   keep short accounts, run to your brother and sister.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.720]   Don't run from them.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.280]   Talk it out, hug it out, love it out.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.360]   Good.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.060]   Tonight.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.060]   Something you need to get on the phone tonight
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.460]   and call someone and say, "I'm sorry for blank."
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:13.680]   Another way that scripture says that he attacks
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.040]   is he disguises.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.940]   He's a master of disguise.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.960]   He makes you believe that he is giving you something
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.580]   that is life filled and really it only leads to death.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.420]   Second Corinthians 11, 14 says,
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.220]   "For even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.380]   He makes you think that it's beautiful,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.340]   that this is a good thing, that this is helping you.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.500]   He's masterful at it.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.280]   And really it's hurting you.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.380]   That bad relationship that all your friends have told you,
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.420]   "I don't know if I go back to that."
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.380]   Oh, but they don't know him.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.460]   They don't know him like I do.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.300]   Like he has this sweet, sensitive side
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.540]   that only he shows me, it's like really cute.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.060]   And you know, like you know he doesn't love God.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.540]   And Satan's like, "Hey, but you could like help him
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.660]   with that, you could pull him closer to God."
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.220]   And he like convinces you of like,
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.580]   "Man, like when y'all are together, it's a good thing.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.340]   Yeah, it produces a lot of hurt.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.820]   And yeah, y'all are like crossing boundaries
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.660]   like you said you wouldn't."
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.900]   And all these different things that have caused
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.920]   like emotional damage and harm and all this stuff.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.740]   But I mean, come on, this is a good thing.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.540]   And he disguises bad things as life-filling things
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.180]   because he's a master disguiser.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.860]   And he disguises himself as an angel of light.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:34.340]   He deceives, he takes truth and he twists them into lies.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.100]   He knows that if you will believe lies about people,
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.380]   about yourself, about God, he has you where he wants you.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.260]   John 8, 44 says this,
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.380]   "Satan was a murderer from the beginning.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.300]   He has always hated the truth
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.120]   because there is no truth in him.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.020]   When he lies, it is consistent with his character
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.820]   for he is a liar and the father of lies."
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.020]   He will tell you things like,
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.600]   "Hey, like you don't need to go to church.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.380]   Like God is your church.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.820]   Like at home, like set up the screen
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.860]   and like you can watch online.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.120]   Like you don't need people."
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.500]   Isolation, attack.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.740]   He'll tell you, "Hey, you don't need to like talk
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.180]   to people about that problem or that sin.
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.260]   Like go to your room and like just talk to God about it."
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.220]   And like, 'cause if you tell people,
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.720]   like what will they think?
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.100]   And they'll like, they don't wanna be around you.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.900]   That's too gross.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.520]   And he knows that if you were to tell them,
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.300]   all they have is a loving embrace like your father does.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.540]   And he doesn't wanna experience
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.820]   your father's love through them.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.580]   So he tells you, "Keep that.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.700]   Don't tell that part.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.220]   Don't you, don't tell that."
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.220]   And he tells you that lie.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.380]   Well, we know that the Bible says,
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.900]   "The truth will set you free."
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.460]   He wants to keep you bound,
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.100]   hidden, dark, isolated.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.840]   He's a deceiver.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.380]   So check yourself, ask yourself, "Where am I life?"
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.640]   Hey, it's just a little insert.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.980]   It's just every now and then,
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.040]   it's not that big of a problem.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.420]   I don't have to, hey, everyone chill out.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.180]   I don't have to tell anyone.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.620]   Like it's just like once every two months.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.300]   And if you give Satan an inch, he will take a mile.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.020]   And those things are controlling your life,
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.360]   whether you like it or not.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.840]   And so come into the light,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.200]   be truthful and don't believe the deceiver's lies.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.320]   The last way we see is that he destroys.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.760]   He takes a life that is meant for fullness
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.240]   and does everything he can to destroy it.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.480]   John 10, 10 says, "The thief comes only to steal
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.800]   and kill and destroy.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.020]   But I have come," Jesus says,
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.680]   "that you may have life and life to the full."
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.560]   I believe that I meet so many people
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.920]   who call themselves Christians.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.100]   I fall into this and I see them and I'm like, "Really?
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.320]   Is this all Christianity is?"
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.020]   Because I don't feel any different.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.280]   And if you've met Christ and you call yourself a Christian
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.500]   and your life looks no different,
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.420]   I would ask you, have you actually met Christ?
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.680]   Because when I read the Bible,
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.800]   I see that when you get Christ, you get a new spirit.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.440]   The old dies and the new comes, you're born again.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.980]   And because of that, you begin to die to your flesh
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.880]   and live for Christ.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.680]   And out of that comes all of this abundance
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.240]   and fruit and life and adventure and joy and peace
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.800]   and patience and kindness and all these different things
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.080]   begin to mark your life.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.680]   And suddenly all these other things that once defined you
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.600]   no longer define you.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.120]   It's just the blood of Jesus that defines you,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.880]   which gives you freedom to be confident all in Jesus.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.840]   But Satan will do anything to take the fullness
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.840]   that Jesus offers and destroy you.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.040]   Why?
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.760]   Because he knows the end of the story.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.460]   He knows that though we're in a battle today
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.280]   and he's been given a little bit of authority on earth,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.580]   he knows how the war ends.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.420]   And he knows that one day Jesus is gonna return
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.060]   and damn him to hell forever.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.240]   And he wants to bring down everyone he can.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.060]   No one likes being miserable alone, not even Satan.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:09.380]   And his mission, it says here, John 10, 10,
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:14.380]   "The thief comes only, only to steal and kill and destroy
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.780]   "and steal and kill and destroy."
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.020]   What does only mean?
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.040]   Only, that's what it means.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.540]   It's like this, imagine this.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.060]   God be with me.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.880]   Imagine, imagine.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.180]   (congregation cheering)
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.820]   One time I learned this because I was doing some skit
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.020]   and they were like, "You need to be able to juggle."
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.220]   And I'm like, "What the?"
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.500]   I go around the back, I learn it.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.460]   And then I'm like juggling now every now and then.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.500]   And so, okay.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.700]   The reason why I dropped those balls
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.300]   is because I'm not a juggler, okay?
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.460]   I got other things to do.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.100]   I got things to live for, okay?
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:58.380]   But imagine if my only point of existence was to juggle.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.100]   Like imagine I was like, you know, born,
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.140]   my parents bring me home.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.700]   They like put these tennis balls in my crib.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.140]   They're like, "You, you're gonna change the world.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.180]   "Like you're gonna be the best circus act in all of the,
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.180]   "you're gonna be worldwide, Mr. Worldwide,
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.540]   "going around juggling."
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.340]   Like, and if that was my mission
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.660]   and my only sense of purpose for all of my life
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.820]   from the age of like, I don't know,
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.940]   when can you start, five?
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.940]   Five to like 27, I'd be up here with chainsaws.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.540]   I'd be up here with a fire.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.060]   I'd be up here like hitting cartwheels
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.700]   and backhand springs while juggling.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.140]   I'd be able to do all of this stuff
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.460]   because it was my only purpose in life.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.900]   But I dropped the balls and all that
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.580]   because I have a lot of other stuff to do.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.960]   You, you don't have just one thing that you're called to do.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.560]   Your attention is divided in so many different ways.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.560]   But Satan, since the beginning of time,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.980]   since Genesis, since before that,
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.260]   when God kicked him out of heaven,
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.420]   his only job has been to steal and take
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.580]   and destroy mankind's life.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.480]   Imagine how good he is at it.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.580]   Imagine how masterful he is at knowing
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.900]   when that heartbreak anniversary hits for you.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.660]   Imagine when he knows when the death of that family member
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   and that day comes.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.640]   I know August 5th is coming for me.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.220]   My dad died, it's gonna be six years.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.540]   And I know that day I have to get ready for battle
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.500]   because Satan's coming for me.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.440]   Because on that day, something's in my mind,
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.860]   no matter how much I read, how much I know,
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.040]   something in me is gonna tell me that God isn't good
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.300]   because my dad died of cancer.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.540]   And that's Satan.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.540]   And you know yours.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.420]   You know when you're most susceptible.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.380]   He's masterful.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.220]   He knows when to attack.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.980]   He knows when you're gonna drive home
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.660]   and you know you shouldn't go home alone.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.980]   You know you shouldn't be in the room alone
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.820]   with that laptop or that technology device.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.540]   He knows it.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.620]   And he watches you do it.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.620]   And right when you get in that room, boom,
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.460]   a wave of temptation to look at that thing you said
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.760]   you'd never look at again.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.680]   He is a master at destroying lives.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.260]   And he's coming for you.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.160]   And Paul is saying,
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.200]   you have to know that you have an enemy.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.000]   You have to know how he is coming for you
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.860]   so that way you can come for him.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:27.320]   I am desperate for my friends to know
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.040]   that you're not just meandering through life,
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.920]   that God has a purpose for you.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.640]   It kills me to think that there are people
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.400]   in this room tonight that don't believe they have a purpose.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.740]   God loves you.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.480]   And he has a purpose for your life.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.640]   And I know, I know it might be hard to see that,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.040]   but you're being deceived.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.440]   He's disguising himself.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.200]   And he's trying to destroy your life
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.160]   in any way that he can.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.700]   And so we, Christian, have to fight.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.440]   We have to ready ourselves for battle.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.880]   This is how we fight our battles.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.080]   We know our enemy.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.400]   We get proactive, not reactive.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.360]   We go on the offense 'cause we got Jesus.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.720]   We fight with truth because we have God's word.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.760]   We get up and we pray before we post on Instagram.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.120]   We as Christians, we get up and we turn to the word
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.260]   before we go to work.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.320]   So many people will spend hours and hours
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.840]   working their life away and spend five minutes in a Devo,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.080]   wondering why they can't fight off the enemy.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.800]   We turn to our father for guidance and decisions
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.440]   before we turn to our friends
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.740]   because he loves to guide us and his children.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.240]   We have weapons, but we have to use them
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.360]   and we have to know there's an enemy.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.560]   I'm gonna ask y'all to do this.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.640]   I did this right before during worship.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.520]   I just set my alarm clocks.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   I got three, three alarm clocks
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.680]   and they all three say, "Armor up."
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.840]   And I just ask you tonight, like, let's remind one another.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.900]   Like go on your alarm clock and just remind yourself,
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.620]   say, "Pray, armor up, put your armor on."
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.860]   Or just say, "You're in a battle," or "Fight your battles,"
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.700]   or whatever you have to write.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.120]   I mean, I'm talking like, let's screenshot that thing,
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.020]   share it, whatever you gotta do to remind each other,
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.900]   "Hey, don't forget you're in a battle.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.560]   There's an enemy coming for you.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.420]   He's coming to destroy your life."
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.540]   And so Paul says, "Since he's coming for you,
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.180]   we have to prepare."
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.940]   And here's how we prepare.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.540]   In Ephesians 6, continuing in verse 13,
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.040]   "Therefore take up the whole armor of God
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.720]   that you may be able to withstand in the evil day.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.400]   And having done all to stand firm."
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.640]   A soldier without armor,
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.620]   he's using this armor illustration,
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.940]   going on with the war zone.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.020]   He is saying a soldier without armor
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.700]   is vulnerable to attack.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.920]   You've gotta put on your armor.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.400]   You've gotta get ready for battle.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.200]   That tells me, and it communicates to me
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.820]   that there is a responsibility on the Christian
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.920]   to ready themselves for battle.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   That you have to proactively get up and make a choice today,
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.220]   flesh in Satan or life in Jesus.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.820]   He gives us a choice.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.220]   And every day you have to decide
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.040]   which one you're gonna choose.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.880]   And I love that he emphasizes
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   that you have to put on the whole armor of God.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.160]   He's like, "Hey, just in case you're wondering,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   there's no good to like put your helmet on
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.560]   and then just be like, charge.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.940]   Like you're gonna get shot everywhere else.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.960]   Like you gotta put it all on."
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.400]   And that means that it's very important
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.260]   that you and I, I'm about to just walk us through each piece.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.940]   And he's saying, "Hey, each piece is so important
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.300]   for the Christian life if you choose to follow God."
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.500]   Like each piece is so important to protect yourself fully
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.360]   from the schemes of the enemy.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.500]   And so take heed.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.420]   I think so many of us one day wanna pick like,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.960]   "Well, here's truth today, maybe.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.660]   And then I'll put on like this, the shoes today
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.960]   'cause they look good.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.540]   You know, like I'll put on this piece or this piece
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.520]   and I don't wanna do all of that.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.360]   That's like radical Christian stuff."
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.980]   And I would tell you to be cautious
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.800]   because there is no room for a part-time Christian
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.400]   when you have a full-time enemy.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.220]   He is full-time.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.900]   He does not sleep.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.860]   He does not stop working.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.700]   He is working around the clock,
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.780]   365 days, seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.800]   And he's coming for you.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.640]   And so are you ready?
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.320]   Paul would say, "This is how you get ready."
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.280]   So let's get ready.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.280]   He's writing this chapter in this book.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.960]   As I said earlier, he was chained to a Roman soldier.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.760]   And so like, I guess the inspiration,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.600]   everyone back then knew about Rome,
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.800]   it's a very powerful empire.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.720]   And so he's using this like metaphor
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.800]   of a soldier's outfit, the armor.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.640]   And it's just so funny.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.200]   I picture that moment of him like chained,
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.080]   like what if like his good hand was chained
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.400]   and like the church in Ephesus was like,
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.160]   "Man, his handwriting is just really bad."
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.200]   Like, you know, he's just writing with what he's got.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.040]   I picture the soldier like seeing him like,
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.920]   "You checking me out?"
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.160]   Like, and he's just like working up and down his armor.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.080]   It's weird, that's how I think.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.600]   But he's looking at this Roman soldier
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.120]   and he's describing these elements
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.080]   in the way in which they put on their armor.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.320]   And I believe that what he describes here
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.780]   is exactly what you and I should wake up with every day
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.760]   and put on as we prepare ourself for battle.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.260]   So the first one, he says,
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:37.040]   "Having fastened on the belt of truth."
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:37.960]   The belt of truth.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.420]   I mean, you guys know what a belt is.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.420]   A belt's purpose is to hold everything together.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.880]   They actually say that the smartest like commanders
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.640]   of this time would tell people to go in the night
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.720]   and cut the belts of the enemy.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.600]   That way, when they attacked,
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.640]   they were spending all their time
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.560]   trying to hold up their trousers and couldn't fight
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.800]   and they were vulnerable.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.160]   Because if you don't have your belt, you can't fight.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.120]   The same way, Paul is saying, if you don't have truth,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.200]   you're gonna fall to lies every single day.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.240]   The Satan, like Satan loves to send lies.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.360]   He loves to tell you that you're not worthy,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.720]   that your past is too messed up,
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.600]   that he just loves to give shame and guilt
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.320]   and remind you of your decisions.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.160]   And he feeds you lies.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.140]   Those people don't like you.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.040]   You would have been invited to that thing.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.480]   Or maybe if you looked a certain way,
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.040]   you'd have more followers and you'd be more influential
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.740]   and you could start that business.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.640]   Well, hey, maybe if you worked harder,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.480]   you could be more successful
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.560]   and you get that atta boy from dad.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.420]   And he feeds you lies and lies and lies.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.100]   And I have watched our generation
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.460]   and generations under us,
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:58.300]   following and being deceived by Satan for far too long
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.400]   because we don't know truth.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.940]   The world and culture tells you
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.600]   that you get to form your own truth,
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.420]   that there is no absolute truth.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.100]   If that's your lived experience, if that's what you think,
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.220]   if that's your opinion, then that is your truth.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.620]   And don't let anyone tell you different.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.820]   That's what the world tells you.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.320]   And that is baloney.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.260]   That is a lie from Satan.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.380]   There is truth.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.240]   And if you call yourself a Christian,
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.060]   then you have agreed to follow the truth
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.160]   founded in God's word.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.660]   It is everything you need for decisions,
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.100]   for guidance, for how you live.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.320]   The problem is we want to pick our truth
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.620]   because we don't like the parts of the Bible
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.920]   that contradict our life.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.820]   And you want to tell the Bible what you're going to do.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.600]   You don't want the Bible to tell you what to do.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.700]   You don't want God to tell you what to do.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.300]   And you're vulnerable.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.380]   And you're getting attacked because you don't know truth.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:03.440]   Truth, that belt, it also holds up the next piece of armor,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.980]   the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.460]   Righteousness is a word that like,
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.820]   people don't talk about a lot.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.980]   It's, righteousness basically just means
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:15.660]   right living for God, like living rightly for God.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.380]   It's the same idea as holiness.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.620]   And people like, it's not fun of the young adult ministry
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.800]   to talk about righteousness.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.180]   It's not very sexy.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.100]   Like, hey, like do the things the Bible says,
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.380]   like live right.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.060]   And that's so sad.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:33.260]   Because when I choose to not want to live rightly
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.140]   according to God's word and what he says is best for me,
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.920]   there's something in me that doesn't believe
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.580]   that he wants what's best for me.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.620]   And righteous living, living rightly for God,
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.860]   it infiltrates every other part of your being.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.140]   The breastplate in these times would go from the neck
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.200]   to the knees and also the back.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.660]   That means that it would cover the major organs of the body.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.060]   It would also cover the most important organ of the body,
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.180]   the heart, and the heart pumps blood
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.740]   into the rest of the body.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.420]   And so Satan knows if I can get them to live disobedient,
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.980]   disobedient to God's word,
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.580]   then I have them right where I want them.
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.020]   If I can get them to live wrongly
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.340]   and not trust that God's way is the best way,
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.200]   I have them right where I want them.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.060]   If I can have them convinced that they can go out
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.580]   and get drunk and be hung over at church the next day
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.060]   and get their God fix for the week,
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.500]   I have them right where I want them.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.940]   And what he does is he creates this watered down version
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.700]   of Christianity where you get to have God and your sin.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.180]   Like you get to have God's way and your way.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.980]   And you get to kind of like come back and forth.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.500]   And it's like a balance beam where like,
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.580]   you get to like, today I'm gonna like be my way.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.420]   And then I'm gonna go be like, oh God, I'm so sorry.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.940]   And then like, I'm gonna do for you for two days
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.420]   and then, oh, go out and do my way.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.300]   And then, oh, and this is this exchange back and forth,
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.140]   back and forth.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.340]   And he has you right where he wants you.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.660]   That's not righteousness.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.060]   God says the best way to live,
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.660]   where you get to experience full life
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.700]   is by right living according to my word.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.740]   And what it has for you,
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.360]   the problem is, is we don't like that.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.400]   That's not fun.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.800]   It doesn't always feel good.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.260]   And you're susceptible to getting attacked
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.620]   by the enemy because of it.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.060]   The next few, I'll kind of go through quick.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.340]   He says, "As shoes to your feet,
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.880]   having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace."
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.920]   The shoes at this time would have little spikes on them,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.760]   like cleats.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.360]   And I love that he says that these were,
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.520]   they've put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.840]   What he's saying there is,
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.260]   these soldiers were ready for battle because they had grip,
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.760]   because they could stand firm.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.120]   They didn't slip, they didn't slide.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.420]   They could run and proactively chase down their enemy
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.840]   because of the grips on their shoes.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.700]   And the grips was given to them by the gospel of peace.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.400]   This tells me that Paul is telling us
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.120]   that if you believe that Jesus Christ left heaven
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.600]   and came to earth and died for your sins
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.000]   and was buried and rose again,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.160]   conquering sin and shame once and for all,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.600]   and if you believe in that,
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.800]   you now, your life can be marked by peace
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.660]   and you can run against any battle.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.340]   You can run towards any enemy
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.240]   because you have a firm foundation on your life
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.160]   that is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.600]   If you're slipping and sliding through life,
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.440]   if you're sinking in quicksand,
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.320]   if you don't know how if you can take another step forward,
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.680]   it's probably 'cause you haven't preached the gospel
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.240]   to yourself in a long time,
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.120]   or you've never received it before in your life.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.080]   The gospel is the only grip that we can have
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.460]   that can give us the confidence to run into the battle.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.620]   And the result is peace every time.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.640]   The next thing in the armor is in all circumstances,
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.300]   take up the shield of faith
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.560]   with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.260]   of the evil one.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.200]   I find this so interesting that Paul gives the caveat,
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.360]   in all circumstances, you need the shield of faith.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.440]   Why does he say that?
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.360]   Like I said earlier,
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.600]   Satan knows that you are most susceptible
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.940]   and he sends his weapons that are the fiery arrows
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.800]   that Paul describes into your life,
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.900]   the temptations, the lies, the hard things in your life.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.220]   He brings them upon you
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.220]   when you're going through really hard storms,
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.560]   when you're going through really hard circumstances,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.200]   that is when he aims and fires.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.440]   And so the way that you fight that weapon
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.880]   and do not fall back into fear is that you stand in faith
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.400]   because you have the shield of faith
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.020]   knowing that God is with you.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.760]   You have faith in him, not in your circumstance.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.560]   That's what the shield of faith does.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.060]   That's what faith in God does,
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.700]   is it defends off the attacks of the enemy on your life
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.060]   in every circumstance.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.420]   If your life is marked by just a roller coaster,
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.860]   that when life is good, you're good,
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.660]   but when it's bad, man, you're bad,
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:56.900]   I would ask yourself, does faith in Christ mark your life?
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.460]   Do you have a shield to protect you from those arrows?
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.900]   And he says, take the helmet of salvation.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.540]   We know that a helmet protected the brain,
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.140]   it protected the head.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.880]   You were in a lot of trouble if you took a blow to the head.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.360]   If anything messed with your brain,
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.200]   the brain, it deals with your mind
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.000]   and Satan loves to attack the mind.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.800]   Assurance and salvation that you are saved
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.300]   from the attacks of the enemy.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.420]   That helmet is where it protects you in the everyday battle.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.760]   And then lastly, our offensive weapon that he gives us.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.440]   You cannot go to battle without a weapon.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.600]   And he says, the sword of the spirit,
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.880]   which is the word of God.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:47.360]   The word of God is the sword of the spirit that we fight
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.360]   and we attack the enemy.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.780]   I think so many people, when the enemy attacks us,
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.320]   we're like, oh my, what was me?
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.040]   I can't, I'm such a dark cave, I don't know what to do.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.120]   And we forget the power that we have
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.040]   through the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.940]   We forget that what Christ offered us
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.960]   through his blood shed on the cross.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.680]   And now when I say the word of God is a sword,
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.840]   I'm not talking about like, I'm God, like with your Bibles.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.000]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.080]   But I'm talking about this right here is a weapon.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.280]   How do we fight our battles?
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.560]   The word of God, the Holy Spirit speaks through us.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.280]   And when Satan comes and offers us nothing but lies
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.160]   and deceptive things and all those different things
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.640]   that he tries to do to attack us,
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.680]   we get to stand upon the word of God that does not change.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   And the reason why you change, the reason why we fall,
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.960]   the reason why we lay prey to his attacks
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.000]   is because we don't know the word.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.720]   We'd rather read some self-care book
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.280]   before reading the book.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.720]   We'd rather watch a one minute sermon to get our fix
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.380]   than going and reading and studying
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.740]   the characteristics of our God.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.240]   No wonder you don't trust him, you don't know him.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.120]   You can't trust someone you don't know.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.120]   This is how we know our God.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.640]   This is how we see his love for us.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.240]   This is just one big masterful love book.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.080]   Sure, Satan is masterful and he's crafty,
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.560]   but God is beautiful.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.740]   He's the master.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.880]   And when you read this,
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   you see that he has such a plan for you.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.840]   And suddenly when Satan comes and he tells you
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.360]   you're not worthy or that no one wants you,
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.640]   you get to speak the word of God and it acts as a weapon
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.400]   and it pierces the lies of the enemy.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.260]   There's power in the spirit of God inside of you.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:38.260]   And if you felt weaponless, if you felt defenseless,
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.940]   and if you felt like you have been hit
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:44.300]   and dragged down by the enemy, I would ask yourself,
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.160]   do you have the spirit of God in you?
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.460]   Do you have a relationship with Jesus?
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.340]   Tonight, everything can change for you.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:52.420]   You can get on the offense,
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.700]   you can get up and you can charge the enemy
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.880]   and you can have a sword in your hand.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.700]   That can be free for you tonight if you receive it.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.540]   Everything can change about your battle.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.700]   I started off this talking about that story with my dad.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.620]   And when I heard that scream
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.220]   and I realized that there was an enemy in the woods,
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.940]   everything changed.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.580]   I told you about my awareness,
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.500]   but that wasn't the only thing that changed.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.660]   I looked down and I realized if a mountain lion attacks me,
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.860]   I don't got a gun.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.660]   And I looked at my dad and I was like,
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.020]   that's the bad man with the gun.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.220]   And so what did I do?
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.220]   I no longer just walked behind my dad.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.180]   I got right in the smack as close as I could
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.260]   in front of my dad.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.700]   And he's behind me holding this gun.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.040]   I remember looking back and being like, okay, yeah,
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.180]   come on, mountain lion.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.860]   I still dare you to try.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.280]   Got my dad back here.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:53.840]   And the reason why I went there,
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:59.660]   and when I look at this verse and it says,
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.700]   "The sword of the spirit, which is the word of God."
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.420]   I want you to think back,
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.500]   like it could be really easy to read these verses
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.540]   and go, oh my gosh, like this is a lot JD.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.140]   Like tomorrow, like I'm gonna wake up
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.420]   and what if I forget to like,
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.660]   what if I believe a lie and like arrow?
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.300]   Or like, what if I do something wrong?
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.860]   Like, should I have like reminders every 30 minutes?
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.260]   Like, how do I do all of this?
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.740]   And we have to rest in the beauty
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.500]   of the first verse of this passage.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:40.940]   Verse 10 says, "Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:45.780]   and in the strength of his might."
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:50.560]   Paul was genius to list out these articles of the armor
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.820]   because all of these articles point to Jesus,
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.020]   the belt of truth.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:58.800]   Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth and the life."
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.020]   The breastplate of righteousness,
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.740]   Jesus who knew no sin became sin
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.780]   so that we could become the righteousness of God.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.720]   The shoes of peace, Romans 5 says,
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   "We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.080]   The shield of faith, Ephesians 2 says,
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.540]   "It's not by works that we receive salvation,
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.820]   but it's by grace through faith that we are saved."
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.400]   The helmet of salvation, John chapter three says,
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.440]   "For God did not send his son Jesus into the world
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.940]   to condemn the world, but to save the world."
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.460]   It's through Jesus that we have salvation.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.700]   The sword of the spirit, because of Jesus's death
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.100]   and burial and resurrection, all who believe in him
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.340]   no longer have to live according to their flesh,
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.780]   but according to the spirit,
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.220]   because the spirit of God now can come inside of us
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.420]   and he's the one who fights.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.820]   It's Jesus who fights on our behalf.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.540]   And so when you're putting on the armor of God,
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:55.700]   you are putting on Jesus and it's him.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.020]   It's his responsibility.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.900]   It's his delight to fight for you.
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.720]   Everything changed about my confidence
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.760]   and the way that I pursued my life
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.160]   when I knew that my dad was behind me with a weapon,
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.060]   ready to attack the enemy for me.
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.180]   Nothing feared.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.180]   I was fully confident walking forward in the same way.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.000]   We have an opportunity to have confidence
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.220]   in the spirit of God inside of us,
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.840]   that it's him who fights on our behalf.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.620]   And my fear is that so many of us wake up
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.740]   and we don't live like this is true.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.720]   We don't access the power that we have
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.520]   through the word of God.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.500]   We don't access the faith that's possible
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.540]   in the midst of the storm.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.720]   And we miss it.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.700]   We miss all that we have because we're being deceived,
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:44.360]   because he's disguising himself a little too well,
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.280]   because he's doing everything he can to destroy our lives.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.960]   But when you put on the armor of God,
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.060]   when you wake up and you say,
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.780]   I will not live for Satan and his schemes today.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:59.320]   I am living for the son of God and I'm letting him fight.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.600]   Everything changes.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.720]   But how?
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:08.440]   Every day, making the choice.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:13.380]   You're believing that we know, if you're a Christian,
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.620]   you know the end of the story, just like Satan knows.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:20.100]   You know that the war ends with Jesus, the victor.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.400]   The Bible says that he is gonna come back,
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:29.320]   riding triumphantly on that white horse, sword in hand.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.820]   And he's gonna claim us, the church, once and for all,
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:37.500]   and Satan and sin and the demons will run.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.900]   And he will banish them to hell forever.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.340]   And sin and its hold on the world
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:46.860]   will be no more at the name of Jesus.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.380]   But though we know the war is conquered by Jesus,
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.900]   it doesn't mean the battle isn't real today.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.400]   It doesn't mean that we don't have a part to play.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.540]   And so Paul ends, everyone says
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.220]   there's six pieces of armor.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.120]   I'd actually argue that there's seven.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:06.440]   He ends with 18, praying at all times in the spirit,
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.960]   with all prayer and supplication.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.400]   Supplication just means prayers.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.520]   To that end, keep alert with all perseverance,
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.900]   making supplication for all the saints.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.900]   Prayer is how we access the spirit of God
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.580]   to come and fight our battles.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.940]   That's how we fight our battles.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.800]   We pray.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.140]   Prayer postures our heart.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.620]   It humbles us.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.220]   It causes us to open up our hands and say,
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.300]   God, I need you to fight the battle today.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.980]   I'm putting on the armor of God,
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.820]   trusting that I am putting on you, Jesus,
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.620]   to fight on my behalf.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.180]   I can't do it on my own, but you can.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:52:00.780]   Second Chronicles 7.14, I'll end with this, says,
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.860]   "If my people who are called by my name
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:08.800]   will humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.360]   and turn from their wicked ways,
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.020]   then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.700]   and I will heal their land."
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.660]   Our land is in desperate need of healing.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:25.660]   Our generation is searching and longing.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.040]   And God just says, if you would trust me.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:34.180]   When Satan sees Christians who are willing
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.340]   to get on their knees and pray,
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.420]   he has no choice but to flee
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.060]   because he knows he stands no chance
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.860]   against the spirit of God.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.900]   That's how we fight our battles.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.740]   And so right now, what we're gonna do
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.240]   is I just wanna take some time to pray
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.860]   and ask God to come and protect us,
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.120]   to protect this church, to protect this ministry,
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.220]   to protect our hearts, to help us live righteously.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.200]   I want us to ask God that he would give us
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.460]   the desires of his heart, to live on mission for him,
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.160]   to no longer be deceived by the enemy,
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.140]   but to want to live for his spirit.
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:13.940]   And so I know that for some of you,
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.420]   I wouldn't expect you to walk up to me right now
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.980]   if we didn't have a relationship and like hug me
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.580]   and talk to me like we've been best friends forever.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.420]   And some of you don't have a relationship with God.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.580]   And I get that praying, especially next to people,
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.340]   might be a really weird and uncomfortable thing.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.380]   And so it might just start, simply start and start simply.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.740]   Just start by opening up your hands and saying tonight,
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.820]   God, will you help me?
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.300]   For some of you, you've been comfortable
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.140]   and you've been deceived by the enemy for too long
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.580]   and you need him.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.780]   You need God to wake you up and revive your soul
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.060]   and to bring you back to your first love.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:43.900]   Pray for it.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:48.580]   And so whether you want to stand up,
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:50.140]   whether you want to lift your hands,
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.580]   whether you want to get on your knees,
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:52.780]   whether you want to open up your hands,
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.460]   if you just want to sit there,
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.580]   I'm just going to give us a chance to stop and pray
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.620]   and practice and believe God and take him at his word
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.860]   that he says, if my people would call my name and pray,
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:03.920]   I will hear them.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.180]   I will heal their land.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.340]   I'll forgive them of their sins.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.320]   God, we need you.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.620]   Take a moment to pray now.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.200]   (gentle music)
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.780]   (gentle music)
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.360]   (gentle music)
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.940]   (gentle music)
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.520]   (gentle music)
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:33.260]   (gentle music)
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:39.780]   (gentle music)
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:46.220]   (gentle music)
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.800]   (gentle music)
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:55:06.660]   Almighty God,
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:11.020]   the protector of our souls,
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.840]   our shield, our sword,
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:17.200]   our conqueror,
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.260]   we need you.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:23.760]   Would you reveal to us where we have believed the lies
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.720]   of the enemy for far too long?
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.280]   Would you wake us up?
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:33.120]   Would you make us more aware of his schemes?
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:39.700]   I pray that tonight people would not receive this message
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.260]   and it strike fear and scare them,
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.020]   but you'd use it to prepare them,
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.540]   that you'd make them more aware
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.240]   so that way they can prepare for battle and fight
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.620]   the good fights.
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:56.220]   We know that greater is he who is in us
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.900]   than he who is in the world.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.460]   And so you are the one we trust in God.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.660]   You are the one that we live for.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.860]   May it start here in Dallas, Texas.
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.220]   May you use the people in this room
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.200]   to say it ends here.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.120]   The generational sin ends here.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.500]   The anti-Jesus culture ends here.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.180]   We will use our platforms to declare of his name.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.420]   We will use our workplaces to declare of his name.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.280]   We will use our stories to proclaim of his name.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.520]   Because God, you are the one we live for.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.580]   And if there's anything that we have believed
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.340]   that has taken us from you,
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.900]   would you open our eyes to it tonight?
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.900]   If there's a person who doesn't have a relationship with you
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.300]   and they've been following the world
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.820]   and not the word and not you,
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.340]   not your son and his blood,
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.140]   would you speak to them right now?
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:57:00.460]   God, we come fully confident in you,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.820]   in the blood of Jesus,
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.180]   understanding that it's through you
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.340]   and it's through your spirit.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.840]   That is how we fight our battles.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.560]   The darkness has to flee at the name of Jesus.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.400]   So we ask right now that would be done
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.040]   as we worship and respond.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.840]   It's your name that we pray, amen.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.340]   Amen.
