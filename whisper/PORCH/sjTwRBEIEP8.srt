1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,480
 - All right, let's go.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,720
 Welcome friends in the room,

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,400
 Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Fayetteville, Phoenix,

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,480
 Menhill, North Carolina, Cedar Rapids,

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,840
 wherever you're tuning in from.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,120
 Houston, let's go.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,520
 Stroh's, close it out.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,440
 Hey, we are wrapping up this series,

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,520
 Ready to Offer Romance,

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,720
 as we explore Song of Solomon

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,000
 and this relationship between this couple.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
 And I thought I would start with a couple

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,260
 that I came across, I found out about this past week,

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,900
 named Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,720
 Who's heard of Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher in here?

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,640
 Nobody, guarantee it.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,120
 Here's who Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher are.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,960
 They hold the record for the longest marriage

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,220
 in the modern era.

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,200
 (audience cheering)

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,760
 Hold on, hold on.

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,240
 You don't even know these people.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,640
 Why are you clapping right now?

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,880
 These two got married in 1924

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,760
 and were married for 87 years

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,440
 till he passed away in 2011.

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,740
 They got married at 18 and 17.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,880
 And when they did, in 1924, think about that,

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,520
 Calvin Coolidge was president.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,760
 Most of you guys don't even know who Calvin Coolidge is.

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
 You think that's a cartoon.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,520
 Babe Ruth was the hero of the day.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,240
 The Great Depression had not happened.

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,920
 The Roaring Twenties was taking place.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
 We're about to be in the Roaring Twenties again

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,960
 and this couple, the woman, just died off in 2013.

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
 But for 87 years, they went through two,

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,880
 I know, I know, what's in their genetics, for real?

40
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,600
 What vitamins and what are they eating?

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,980
 They went through 15 presidential administrations.

42
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,860
 They survived the Great Depression, World War II,

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,700
 the Korean War, the Vietnam War.

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,640
 They were in their 60s and married together

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,660
 and had over four decades of marriage

46
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,420
 when we landed on the moon.

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,240
 (laughs)

48
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,100
 That is crazy.

49
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,160
 They were in their mid to late 60s

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,860
 whenever JFK was assassinated and they just died in 2013.

51
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,980
 It is the longest recorded marriage in modern history.

52
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,340
 To find a marriage similar, you would have to almost

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,640
 go back to Abraham and Sarah in the Bible.

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
 That is how straight up long these two were together

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,420
 and they had a marriage that clearly lasted.

56
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,220
 They had a relationship that far exceeds anything

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,660
 most of us, all of us likely will ever experience

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,740
 in marriage, but what does that have to do

59
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,240
 with where we're going tonight?

60
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,420
 Well, in a similar way that their marriage

61
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,260
 was able to stand the test of time.

62
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,620
 This series has been devoted to helping create

63
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,740
 and helping us build a foundation for dating,

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,620
 for relationships, for romance from God's word

65
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,100
 so that you and I can have the best chance

66
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,860
 at having a marriage that succeeds.

67
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,300
 And this was almost as if it were a marriage made in heaven.

68
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,260
 I mean, that's incredible.

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,020
 And tonight we're gonna wrap up this series

70
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,740
 and what I wanna do is I wanna give two takeaways

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,420
 and drive 'em home as clear as I can from God's word

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,860
 in this final chapter of Song of Solomon

73
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,100
 on what a marriage made from heaven should look like.

74
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,560
 Inside of the room right now,

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,700
 most of you will be married in the next 10 years.

76
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,260
 That's not a guarantee and it's not a promise.

77
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,940
 Statistically, the odds are in your favor.

78
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,820
 And so if that's true, and there are a few decisions

79
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,260
 in life other than trusting and walking with Jesus

80
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,620
 and who you're gonna worship that are more

81
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,660
 gonna significantly impact your life than who you marry.

82
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,260
 And so if you can go in knowing this is what God says

83
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,540
 marriage is about, this is the type of relationship

84
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,500
 you should be looking for,

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,260
 who would not want to experience that?

86
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,500
 A fool, is who.

87
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,820
 And so we're gonna talk tonight about the last two things

88
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,620
 from what God says, you wanna have a marriage made

89
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,000
 in heaven, here's what it looks like.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,100
 And let me just say something really quick

91
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,020
 before we dive in.

92
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,580
 There's a lot of talk in our culture

93
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,580
 about what marriage is and what it isn't.

94
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,620
 When it comes to the arena of marriage,

95
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,380
 biblically God says you and I don't get to say

96
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,720
 what it is or what it isn't or what it should look like

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,260
 because he defines marriage.

98
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,800
 And from the very beginning, he orchestrated

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,920
 this incredible thing that he said,

100
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,320
 marriage is gonna be a picture and a metaphor

101
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,300
 of my love for the church.

102
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,900
 So you can add rules, change rules, do whatever you want,

103
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
 but when you step in the arena of marriage,

104
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,860
 it's like you're stepping on God's territory,

105
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,280
 as though all of life was not already there.

106
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,640
 But in a weird way, it's like you're walking

107
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,220
 and if you were gonna step towards marriage,

108
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,740
 like I said, most of you are, you need to know

109
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,780
 you are stepping towards holy ground,

110
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,740
 like take off your sandals type of holy ground.

111
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,820
 And what he says about marriage and what it should look like

112
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,260
 is gonna define what those of us who experience

113
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,620
 a marriage made in heaven are gonna have in our relationship.

114
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,900
 So we're gonna continue the series,

115
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,260
 we're gonna look at Song of Solomon, chapter eight,

116
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,160
 I'm gonna give two takeaways.

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,780
 I'm gonna read through the text, unpack it,

118
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,360
 we're gonna have two takeaways from this text,

119
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,680
 really from the book in general,

120
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,000
 and we'll get you guys out of here with enough time

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,800
 to see the Astros clinch the world series, how about that?

122
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,400
 All right, we'll start in verse five of chapter eight.

123
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
 We continue it, in case you're joining us for the first time,

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,640
 here's what Song of Solomon is.

125
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,940
 It's like the Romeo and Juliet of the Bible.

126
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,680
 It is a book that was included in the scripture

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,880
 that God celebrates romance between one man, one woman.

128
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
 Who's the one man?

129
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,640
 His name is King Solomon, he's the king.

130
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,820
 His married girl, or his boo, was named Shulamite,

131
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,300
 or Shulamith, and they had this relationship

132
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,320
 we've traced for the last handful of weeks.

133
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,620
 If you missed it, you can go check it out on the Porch app,

134
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,600
 on iTunes, or podcasts, and catch up with us.

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
 But they've just had this journey where they went from

136
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,360
 not in a relationship, to dating, to engaged,

137
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,140
 married, honeymoon night, and conflict,

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,980
 and we've just explored.

139
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,220
 And tonight, we're gonna get into the

140
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,600
 till death do us part part of the song.

141
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,920
 And it is a song, just to remind you,

142
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,320
 so it goes back and forth.

143
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,720
 It's very poetic, and it's like the guy sings something,

144
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,640
 the girl sings something, every once in a while,

145
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,220
 the friends kind of chime in and give their two cents too.

146
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,400
 So we're gonna pick it up in verse five,

147
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,280
 where the friends chime in as they see this couple

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,500
 coming back from this bed and breakfast weekend getaway

149
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,800
 that they had had we covered last week.

150
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
 So here's it, verse five.

151
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
 Friends speaking.

152
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,720
 "Who is that coming up from the wilderness,

153
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,600
 "leaning on her beloved?"

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,920
 So who is that girl riding in that chariot,

155
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
 she's leaning on her boy, who is that?

156
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,680
 And they know it's rhetorical, it's her.

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,880
 And she chimes in and begins to speak to her husband.

158
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 "Under the apple tree where I awakened you,

159
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,140
 "or I aroused you," your translation may have.

160
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,780
 "There your mother was in labor with you,

161
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,760
 "there she who bore you was in labor."

162
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,240
 She basically brings up what feels incredibly awkward

163
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
 and weird to us, but she basically says,

164
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,960
 like man, underneath, it's an expression

165
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,680
 of the continuing legacy of love and relationships

166
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,760
 from their generation to their parents' generation.

167
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,400
 That means, that's like weird for us in this day and age

168
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,960
 and cultural and Hebrew, it would have been a affirming

169
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,840
 and connecting to their legacy of their family tradition.

170
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,040
 And she's speaking erotically, as we talked about,

171
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,120
 apple trees having been seen as an aphrodisiac,

172
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,960
 making love in this particular place.

173
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,140
 "Set me," verse six, "as a seal on your heart,

174
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,680
 "or as a seal on your arm."

175
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,460
 A seal was like a stamp that someone would have,

176
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,880
 like in that day and age, people would have a seal

177
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,480
 and it would be like, this is a declaration,

178
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,640
 this is my possession, so I'm putting my seal

179
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,000
 on different things that I own,

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,320
 so that people can know that it's mine.

181
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,680
 Same thing you do at your apartment with your roommates,

182
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,440
 when you write your initials on the milk,

183
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,220
 and you're like, hey, nobody else eat this milk,

184
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,400
 'cause it's got my initials on it,

185
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,680
 who ate my milk in here, or somebody borrowed my clothes,

186
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,320
 and I clearly put my initials on side of it,

187
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,560
 'cause I'm declaring what?

188
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,040
 That's mine, my possession.

189
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,640
 She's saying, I want you to put that type of thing

190
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,760
 on your heart with me.

191
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,480
 Like, all of your affections are mine,

192
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,560
 and I'm all of yours, and put it on your arm

193
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
 so that people can publicly know and declare

194
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,120
 through your actions that we are one another's,

195
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
 I'm possessed, and I possess my boy.

196
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,100
 Verse seven, "For love is as strong as death,

197
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,380
 "and jealousy is as fierce as the grave.

198
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,000
 "It's flashes are the flashes of fire,

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,640
 "and the very flame of the Lord."

200
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,160
 Love is as strong as death,

201
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,660
 as in it lasts all the way to the grave.

202
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,280
 Jealousy is as fierce as the grave,

203
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,280
 in other words, death and the grave is not selective

204
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,000
 in who it chooses, and it's gonna, it takes all of us.

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,320
 So jealousy, in the context of marriage,

206
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,320
 there's like a righteous jealousy that takes place

207
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,000
 where it is not selective towards being protective

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,920
 of the person that it loves.

209
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
 What do I mean by that?

210
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,240
 Like, inside of the context of marriage,

211
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,520
 there's a righteous jealousy where you're like,

212
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,240
 hey, this is my girl, nobody else,

213
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,480
 I don't care who you are, is getting near her

214
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,240
 or spending one-on-one time or talking to her

215
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,640
 like her husband talks to her.

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
 I don't care if you're my best friend

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,480
 or if you're in my family or any of that,

218
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,420
 I'm protective, and it says it's as fierce,

219
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,800
 as jealousy is as fierce as the grave.

220
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,240
 Verse eight, or verse seven,

221
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,920
 "Many waters or trials when storms of life come

222
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,980
 "cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it out.

223
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,720
 "If a man were to offer, offered for love

224
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,280
 "all the wealth of his house,

225
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,840
 "he would be utterly despised."

226
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,640
 That wealth, or that love is such a thing

227
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
 that you can't buy it.

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
 This would be where you insert the Alicia Keys songs.

229
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,320
 Some people want it all.

230
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
 I don't want anything at all,

231
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
 but your love is basically what she's saying.

232
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,800
 Verse eight, this is where it takes

233
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,160
 what I think is the weirdest turn in the entire book.

234
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,120
 And it goes to like a flashback

235
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
 that her brothers introduced where it says this.

236
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,160
 We have a little sister and she has no breasts.

237
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,400
 And you're going, what are they talking about?

238
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,780
 She's flashing back, and I'll tell you

239
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,480
 why I say that in a second.

240
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,640
 But it's her brothers speaking

241
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,400
 and speaking of an earlier time in life

242
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,840
 and by no breasts, they're not like throwing shade at her.

243
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,920
 They're saying she hasn't gone through puberty yet

244
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,160
 and we have a little sister.

245
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
 Verse eight, "What shall we do for our sister

246
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,520
 "on the day when she is spoken for?

247
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,040
 "If she is a wall, we will build on her

248
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,120
 "battlements of silver."

249
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,240
 In other words, if she protects herself as a wall,

250
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
 talking about her purity,

251
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,840
 then we're gonna put battlements,

252
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,560
 you know, decorative battle stuff.

253
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,800
 Silver doesn't, you don't make silver for battle

254
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
 or for protection, it's just kind of for decoration.

255
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,160
 "But if she is a door, we will enclose her

256
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,600
 "with boards of cedar."

257
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,440
 Dude, I love that.

258
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,480
 If you have a sister in the room,

259
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,360
 you know what these guys are saying right here.

260
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
 What is a door?

261
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
 A door is something that opens to give access

262
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,440
 to other people.

263
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
 So the brothers are going,

264
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,440
 hey, if she can't learn to control herself,

265
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,400
 we are going to board that door up.

266
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
 That's what they're saying.

267
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,720
 She says, verse 10, "I was a wall."

268
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,480
 So that's why we say it's a flashback.

269
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,040
 "And my breasts are like towers."

270
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,880
 Dang, girl.

271
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,080
 "Then I was in his eyes like one who finds peace."

272
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,240
 This verse, man, there's so much in this passage

273
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,080
 that's beautiful.

274
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,720
 One is that some scholars think she's like,

275
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 she's taking a jab at the brothers who were like,

276
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,600
 oh yeah, I was a sister with no breasts,

277
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,640
 now I got some towers.

278
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,880
 And the other thing is that she says,

279
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,400
 "I was like one who found peace," or shalom.

280
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 And the word shalom is the same translation

281
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,720
 for the name Solomon.

282
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,880
 It was as though Solomon found in me peace

283
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,000
 and I found my Solomon or my peace through this relationship.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,120
 Solomon had a vineyard, so then she uses a metaphor

285
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,080
 to talk about their relationship.

286
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,380
 And she says this, "Solomon," that's her husband,

287
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,040
 "had a vineyard at Baal Hamon," that's just a place.

288
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,120
 "He leased out the vineyard to keepers,

289
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,000
 "and each one was to bring for its fruit

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,520
 "a thousand pieces of silver.

291
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,920
 "My vineyard," so she says in the same way,

292
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,960
 "My vineyard," talking about her body

293
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,080
 all throughout the book, we've addressed her vineyard

294
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,840
 as her body, "is my very own, and is before me,

295
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,440
 "you, O Solomon, may have the thousand

296
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
 "and the keepers of the fruit 200."

297
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,880
 She's talking about her body, saying,

298
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,160
 "I'm giving all of the fruits of myself to you."

299
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,940
 And he says, "You who dwell in the gardens

300
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,280
 "with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice."

301
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,360
 She says, the last line of the book,

302
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,520
 "Come away, my beloved, be like a gazelle

303
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,640
 "or a young stag on the spice-laden mountains,"

304
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,000
 talking about her breasts again.

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,360
 She's basically like, hey, we're gonna hit repeat,

306
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,960
 make love to you all night long,

307
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,440
 and keep that track rolling,

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
 is essentially where the book ends.

309
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,240
 Now, what I wanna do is I wanna cover two takeaways

310
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,800
 from something that we learned from this couple

311
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,660
 in this passage, and really throughout the entire book,

312
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,000
 that are the marks of a marriage that is made from heaven,

313
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,840
 or the type of marriage that God wants you to have.

314
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,840
 And the first one is this, marriage is a covenant.

315
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,880
 What do I mean by that?

316
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
 This is really, really important.

317
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,320
 What is a covenant?

318
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,680
 That's a word that maybe you've heard before,

319
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
 and people are talking, they'll kinda throw it out there.

320
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,960
 Biblically, you can look at Hebrews 9,

321
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,680
 you look all throughout the Bible.

322
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,880
 A covenant is a relationship that two parties enter into,

323
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,440
 and it is only able to end by death of one party.

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
 It is a covenant that people enter,

325
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,840
 and it's till death do us part every single time.

326
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,180
 You cannot get out of it in the same way

327
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,520
 you would get out of a contract.

328
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,400
 A lot of you guys are in contracts with AT&T,

329
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,740
 and you're like, dude, if they could beat Verizon,

330
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,960
 or if Verizon could beat them,

331
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,300
 I would go over to them in a heartbeat,

332
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,240
 and that's a contract.

333
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,920
 A covenant is a relationship that you mutually enter into

334
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
 that can only end in death.

335
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,000
 Marriage, biblically, is a relationship

336
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 where two people enter into that can only be ended by death.

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,520
 It is the fact that it is a covenant,

338
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,520
 and the reason the text says love is as strong as death,

339
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,000
 it matches it all the way to the grave.

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,180
 They are entered into a relationship that is a covenant

341
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,560
 that lasts an entire lifetime.

342
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
 That's what their marriage is.

343
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,480
 That's what marriage biblically is.

344
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
 This is why the couple can have the mark of jealousy

345
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,680
 and it be a righteous thing,

346
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,320
 because they've entered in and they've agreed,

347
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,980
 man, I'm his, he's mine for life.

348
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,960
 I have possession over this person,

349
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,140
 and there can be a righteous jealousy to that.

350
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,080
 You may think like jealousy every time is all bad.

351
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,180
 That's not true.

352
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,080
 Jealousy can be, hey, I rightfully have rights

353
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,520
 over this thing in this marriage.

354
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,680
 God, we're told, has jealousy over you.

355
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,280
 You know that?

356
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,440
 That he yearns jealously over his people

357
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,940
 who are rightfully his.

358
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,280
 Now, what is not righteous jealousy,

359
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,960
 let me just say this, 'cause this probably is something

360
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,080
 that consistently one of the things that gets asked

361
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,160
 by people, what's not righteous jealousy

362
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,280
 and what this does not apply to is those of us in the room

363
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,760
 who are in dating relationships who jealousy

364
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
 is just kind of like our, we just claim it

365
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,840
 as that's just kind of who I am.

366
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
 Now, I need to see your phone and see who you've been

367
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,000
 texting or see what DMs, you know, other girls

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,480
 or you've been passing on to other girls are.

369
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,080
 That type of jealousy is not what the Bible's talking about.

370
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,800
 And generally speaking, let me just say something,

371
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,540
 like that type of jealousy or the type of jealousy

372
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,800
 where the guy's like, hey, I can't believe

373
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,080
 that you were talking to that guy.

374
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,400
 You know, I'm about to go punch that dude right in the face.

375
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
 You're like, what, easy, he was taking my order

376
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,480
 at Starbucks, that's the guy that I was talking,

377
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
 why are you gonna punch?

378
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
 That type of jealousy is not what the Bible says

379
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,080
 is a healthy or righteous, typically good thing.

380
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,440
 In fact, let me just be like a friend here

381
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,600
 and a big brother to you.

382
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
 Typically, when I hear someone talk about,

383
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,360
 hey, my girlfriend is just so controlling,

384
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,720
 she wants to see my phone, she wants to see

385
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,640
 who I've been talking to, or the guy or the girl's

386
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,760
 describing about how my boyfriend, he just like struggles

387
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,000
 with rage or jealousy, those are consistently red flags,

388
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,560
 and if you are experiencing those, you should be concerned.

389
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,400
 Why do I say that?

390
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,300
 Almost every time that that's happening,

391
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,220
 one of two things is happening.

392
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,600
 Either the girl, in that scenario, if she's the jealous one

393
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,880
 or the guy, if they're the jealous one,

394
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,200
 they are using, or there's some baggage from the past

395
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
 that they have just not worked through,

396
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,800
 and so they hide behind the banner of,

397
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,220
 I'm just slow to trust, and it's because they haven't healed

398
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,280
 from their past baggage.

399
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,660
 The Bible says that love always trusts

400
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,200
 in 1 Corinthians 13.

401
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,680
 So as a Christian, you do not get the excuse

402
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,420
 to hide behind, I just don't trust people easily.

403
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,360
 So if they're in that scenario, there's either baggage

404
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,620
 from their past or current baggage of their present.

405
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,160
 Maybe somebody cheated on them, something painful happened

406
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,900
 in their past, but generally, it's like, dude,

407
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,820
 she hasn't healed from that, or you are a sleazeball

408
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,280
 and not trustworthy, and it's typically

409
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
 one of those two scenarios.

410
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,660
 Either way, it's not a great reflection

411
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,520
 of the relationship where it's like, oh, no, no, no,

412
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,000
 she doesn't have any baggage, I'm just a total sleazeball.

413
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,080
 Not a great sign of the relational health.

414
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,160
 So if you're in that scenario, you should at least

415
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,000
 have some concern and be thoughtful about that.

416
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,840
 Why can I not trust this person?

417
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,860
 Is it baggage that I need to heal from and you need to own?

418
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,720
 Or are you dating people who are not trustworthy?

419
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,480
 And you should not date people who are not trustworthy,

420
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,960
 who are not worthy of your trust,

421
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,700
 or have not proven worthy of your trust.

422
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,000
 But this, in this covenant context,

423
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,440
 there was an appropriate jealousy that was being

424
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,880
 displayed here because it was a covenant.

425
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,240
 So marriage is a covenant.

426
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,900
 A covenant can only end in death.

427
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,000
 Most of you are gonna get married in the next 10 years.

428
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,500
 You're gonna step into something God says is mine.

429
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,080
 And it is a relationship that I have said

430
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,840
 only ends in death.

431
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:13,960
 Wait, David, what about divorce?

432
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,720
 Doesn't that end a relationship?

433
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,600
 Can't a marriage end in divorce?

434
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,000
 I mean, I've seen all kinds of relationships.

435
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,900
 My parents' marriage ended in a divorce,

436
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,680
 or a divorce took place in my marriage.

437
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,280
 So am I saying that that actually was not

438
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,760
 the dissolving of that relationship?

439
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,880
 Maybe.

440
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,400
 Jesus is asked about marriage in Matthew chapter 19.

441
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,920
 And he's asked by these guys who come up,

442
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
 they're called Pharisees, they're basically like the

443
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,480
 just kind of religious leaders of the day.

444
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,160
 They're coming to trap Jesus and they go up

445
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,720
 and they're like, hey, Jesus, what are the scenario

446
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,400
 and circumstances when it's okay to divorce your wife?

447
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,480
 And Jesus gives them this answer.

448
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
 This is Matthew chapter 19, verse three.

449
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,680
 The Pharisees came up and tested him by asking,

450
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,200
 is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?

451
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 And he answered, have you not read, that's Jesus speaking,

452
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,120
 that he who created them from the beginning

453
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,340
 made them male and female?

454
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,840
 Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother

455
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,880
 and hold fast to his wife,

456
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,080
 and the two shall become one flesh.

457
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,080
 Therefore, there are no longer two, but they are one flesh.

458
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,320
 What God has joined together, let no man separate.

459
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,400
 People come up, they're like, Jesus, hey,

460
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,480
 what are the circumstances under which it's okay

461
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,320
 to get a divorce?

462
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,440
 If they cheat on you, if they are just mean to you,

463
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,780
 if you just don't like them that day,

464
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,000
 if you're ready to move on, when is it okay?

465
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,260
 And Jesus, in response to them saying,

466
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,880
 when is it permissible, gives an answer that reflects,

467
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,620
 I'm not even sure it's possible.

468
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,780
 That the state of Texas may recognize your divorce,

469
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,660
 but that doesn't mean that God does.

470
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,460
 That there may be a scenario where people came together

471
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,460
 and they're like, hey, you know,

472
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,100
 mutually irreconcilable differences, we're kinda over this,

473
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,220
 and you have stamped it and you have seen it, divorce,

474
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,740
 but that doesn't mean that God says

475
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,180
 the marriage is over in his eyes,

476
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,220
 or that that person is free to remarry,

477
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,360
 because God says, marriage is mine,

478
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,820
 and when you bring those two together,

479
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,120
 it's as though I fuse them into one,

480
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,020
 and it is hard to un-one what God made one.

481
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,940
 It's like this, there's an old illustration

482
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,660
 we've used here before, where if I take this,

483
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,500
 and I'm to pour what represents one person

484
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,760
 in the relationship, and this is you,

485
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,140
 guys is blue, and ladies, as close as we get to pink,

486
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,340
 and I pour this in here,

487
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,920
 and then I decided, you know,

488
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,580
 I'm not really digging the whole,

489
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,300
 what is that, like crimson or maroon,

490
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,860
 I'm just gonna separate these things back out,

491
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,220
 and I try to pour the blue back in here

492
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,600
 and the red back in here, it wouldn't work,

493
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,860
 because they've moved together,

494
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,980
 and the Bible says, as crazy as this is,

495
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,900
 and I need you to hear me,

496
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
 'cause this is what you are walking into,

497
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,180
 that there isn't some like, hey, if this doesn't work out,

498
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,360
 we'll just hit the ejection button.

499
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,300
 God says, you have moved together in a way

500
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,040
 that you cannot un-one and separate from one another.

501
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,460
 Now, there are people who disagree,

502
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,740
 or there are people who would say,

503
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,380
 inside of the Bible, there's two exceptions,

504
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,420
 if they abandon you, or if there's adultery.

505
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,220
 Those would be times where the marriage would dissolve,

506
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,220
 and I don't have time to get into all the different

507
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,520
 scenarios and opinions, but godly people would disagree,

508
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
 but here's what everyone would agree on.

509
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,180
 Marriage is a big deal to God.

510
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,580
 It is something you should not take lightly.

511
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,740
 He does not take lightly,

512
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
 and he says in Ephesians chapter five,

513
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,900
 it is a reflection of me and my love for the church,

514
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,060
 and the reason why you cannot just leave

515
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,980
 is because I do not just leave,

516
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,100
 and every time a marriage is broken apart,

517
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,060
 especially by Christians, it is an indictment,

518
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,860
 or it is a poor reflection of what my covenant,

519
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,860
 Jesus speaking, and his love to his bride, the church.

520
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,100
 Marriage is a covenant that only ends in death.

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,380
 It's having a real truth real quick.

524
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,220
 It's having a divorce.

525
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,660
 You can find out more answers on specifics of that stuff.

526
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,180
 There's people who disagree on some of the implications,

527
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,860
 or some gray areas, but no one disagrees.

528
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,420
 Marriage is a big deal.

529
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,460
 In Malachi chapter 2, 16, God says, "I hate divorce."

530
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,540
 And if you've come from a home like I did,

531
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,460
 it's no wonder why, because of the pain and the destruction

532
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,220
 that divorce introduces to the couple, to the children,

533
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,300
 to the family, to anyone who's involved.

534
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,780
 I feel the pain of divorce at every holiday,

535
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,980
 as I know many of you do.

536
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,940
 Sadly, more and more, just as a pastor,

537
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,020
 you get to, I'm a part of weddings all the time,

538
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,820
 and it is a rare thing for me to do a wedding

539
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,460
 where the bride and the groom both have parents

540
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,380
 who stay together, and it becomes this whole orchestration

541
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,620
 of, you know, here's my mom and stepfather,

542
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,500
 and who's gonna sit where, and who's gonna say

543
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,480
 her mother and I?

544
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,440
 And it is a tragic thing, and God, who loves you,

545
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,860
 doesn't want you to experience that.

546
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,940
 So as someone who is incredibly vested in your success,

547
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,000
 and your future marriage being amazing,

548
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,660
 because marriage is amazing, I want you to go in

549
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,340
 with eyes wide open, and my whole goal for this talk

550
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,260
 is for you to go in going, whoa, that's a really big deal,

551
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
 which is exactly how the disciples

552
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,940
 responded to Jesus' teaching.

553
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,060
 In other words, at the end of Jesus saying that,

554
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,220
 the disciples would go, whoa, Jesus,

555
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,340
 that was a little intense.

556
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,860
 If that's the case, maybe it's better to not marry,

557
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,460
 and Jesus isn't like, oh, no, guys, it's the best.

558
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,300
 Are you kidding me?

559
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,940
 No, you gotta try it, it's so great.

560
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,540
 He just basically kind of walks off.

561
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,660
 He's like, some people can accept it,

562
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,500
 some people can't, and he walks off.

563
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,020
 But yes, it is a big deal, and you need to know

564
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,460
 you are entering into a covenant.

565
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,840
 So that's the first thing, that marriage by definition

566
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,900
 is a covenant.

567
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,820
 The second is that marriage and love,

568
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,080
 and this is, we're two-point message tonight.

569
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,420
 In marriage, love is a choice.

570
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,580
 So there's a lot of debate, even as I was thinking

571
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,020
 and working on this message this week,

572
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,300
 and I know some of you guys right now

573
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,960
 are disagreeing with me, like, yeah, sometimes it's a choice,

574
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,260
 but other times it isn't.

575
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,220
 And there's even things that we talk about in culture,

576
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,940
 we're like, love is a verb, or love is a noun,

577
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,180
 or love is a feeling, or love is,

578
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,820
 these different expressions, it's kind of like,

579
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,240
 you know, we disagree and we agree,

580
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,780
 and it's kind of all of them, right?

581
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,240
 No, biblically, love is a choice, and it's a command.

582
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,080
 In marriage.

583
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,020
 What do I mean by that?

584
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,900
 The word, so this is getting a little bit heady.

585
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,100
 Everybody put the thinking caps on, here we go.

586
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,940
 This is an educated crowd, though, and listening in,

587
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,520
 I'm confident you've got this.

588
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,960
 In Hebrew, which is the original language

589
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,500
 Song of Solomon was written, you guys follow me?

590
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,660
 In the original language, there are three different words

591
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,540
 in the book of Song of Solomon for love.

592
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,780
 Each of them has a different variation.

593
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,140
 In other words, in Hebrew, there are three ways

594
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,620
 that you can talk about love, or three types of love.

595
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,540
 In English, we're pretty simple.

596
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,500
 So we just like to use love, so we're like,

597
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,560
 I love chocolate, and I love the astros,

598
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,580
 and I love her, and God, I love you.

599
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,420
 We use the same word.

600
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,020
 In Hebrew, there's different expressions

601
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,460
 that you would use for different scenarios.

602
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,840
 There's three types of love.

603
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,500
 The first love is called rayah.

604
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,180
 It's in the book, it's a companion love,

605
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,220
 like you're my companion, my friend, I feel affection.

606
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,080
 You can have this kinda like, hey, we're platonic,

607
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,140
 just bros here, that's the type of love.

608
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,980
 The second type of love is dod.

609
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,960
 This is erotic or sexual love.

610
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,420
 This was like the honeymoon night.

611
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,020
 That's what they were using there, dod, D-O-D.

612
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,060
 The third type of love is the love

613
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,760
 that they mention in this chapter.

614
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,120
 It's called ahava, A-H-A-V-A.

615
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,000
 It is a word that by definition means a love of decision.

616
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,640
 It's a word that literally comes from the root

617
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,840
 to give of oneself, to decide to give of oneself.

618
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,220
 It is the type of love that says,

619
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,780
 hey, I see everything messed up,

620
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,560
 and no matter how hard it gets, I'm not going anywhere.

621
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,100
 It's not the erotic love, which can't make a marriage last.

622
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,060
 It's not just a companion, hey, you're my buddy love.

623
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,600
 It is a I am committed and I'm keeping the covenant love.

624
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,160
 That's what the ahava is in that text.

625
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,560
 The ahava is the one that is stronger than death

626
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,540
 or is as strong as death.

627
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,120
 By definition in here, it is that love is a deciding love.

628
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,840
 It is a choice that you make.

629
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,080
 That's what is mentioned here.

630
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,240
 Biblically, in Ephesians chapter five,

631
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,320
 the apostle Paul would pick this up,

632
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,880
 and he would say, hey, husbands,

633
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,080
 here's how you should think about love.

634
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,500
 Here's what he says in Ephesians chapter five, verse 25.

635
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church,

636
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,480
 and that he gave himself up for her.

637
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,780
 That's nuts in our day and age.

638
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,620
 Here's what I mean.

639
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,340
 If you think about it, the level of times

640
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,580
 or the number of times that people are like,

641
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,700
 look, I just don't love her anymore,

642
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,740
 or I'm not in love with her anymore,

643
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,980
 Paul would say, here's what I hear you saying,

644
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,560
 21st century person, you are directly rejecting

645
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,260
 the command of God in your life.

646
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,760
 You're choosing to say, hey, God,

647
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,280
 choosing to be disobedient to what you command in Bible.

648
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,960
 Think about that.

649
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,640
 Paul would say, look, it's not husbands,

650
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,240
 love your wife when you are in love,

651
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,580
 or husbands, love your wife when you feel love.

652
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,600
 It is husbands, love, sacrificially lay down your life

653
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,740
 for your wife.

654
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,800
 It is a command.

655
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,720
 It is a choice, and in marriage,

656
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,080
 it is not an optional thing.

657
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,520
 It is I'm making the decision.

658
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,600
 I am laying down my life, my desires,

659
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,800
 and my preferences come second to yours,

660
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,200
 and mutually doing that together with your spouse.

661
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,160
 Love is a choice.

662
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,840
 It is not a feeling that, hey, I only do this

663
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,040
 whenever I feel like it.

664
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,340
 Biblically, listen to me.

665
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,600
 Love is a command of God,

666
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,880
 and as soon as you enter into that,

667
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,240
 and this is what makes marriage

668
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,480
 both amazing and really hard,

669
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,120
 because here's what marriage is.

670
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,920
 It is one day of dying to yourself

671
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,360
 after the next, after the next, after the next.

672
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,320
 Like, dude, let me be honest.

673
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,960
 Marriage is amazing, 'cause this is the tension that I feel.

674
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,560
 It's like, you don't wanna have people be like,

675
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,240
 oh my gosh, I'm never getting married,

676
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,560
 and you don't want also people to be like,

677
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,600
 yes, it's amazing, our love will last us through a lifetime.

678
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,560
 You know, it's gonna be great,

679
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,680
 and I want you to walk in with a silver,

680
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,280
 like, marriage is amazing, dude.

681
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,920
 Like, it's incredible, and it's one of the greatest gifts.

682
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
 You can have sex whenever you want,

683
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,040
 or whenever they're willing,

684
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,000
 and you can just have an amazing time together,

685
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
 and you've got this friend, and you're always,

686
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,760
 like, it's awesome, it's the greatest thing ever,

687
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,280
 and yet it is also really, really hard,

688
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,200
 and one of the reasons it's hard

689
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 is because love is a command in the Bible

690
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,320
 where you constantly have to go,

691
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,560
 I have to die to myself,

692
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,520
 and I'm choosing not to just do what I want in this moment,

693
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,160
 but for the needs of the person in front of me there.

694
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,000
 Here's why this matters,

695
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,580
 because you are going to step into a marriage,

696
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,200
 and there's gonna come a day you're gonna wake up,

697
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,240
 and you're not gonna feel like loving that person that day,

698
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,200
 'cause here's what happens in dating.

699
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,960
 Like, in dating, dude, you guys,

700
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,080
 man, you just have no idea, here we go.

701
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
 In dating, you're in this stage right now,

702
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,560
 I remember it, where opposites attract,

703
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,360
 and you're like, oh, man, they're so quiet,

704
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,200
 it's like they're so mysterious over there,

705
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,800
 and everything about 'em, you're like, gosh,

706
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,680
 and then you get in marriage, and you're like,

707
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,880
 is anything going on in there at all?

708
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,280
 You're so quiet, and the thing that attracted you,

709
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,400
 all of a sudden, you want to attack them for.

710
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
 There was a psychologist that said opposites attract,

711
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,880
 and in a marriage, they attack,

712
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
 and so all of a sudden, you go from,

713
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,800
 man, she's just so fun-loving, and like,

714
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,960
 she's just free-spirit, and I'm just kinda buttoned up,

715
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
 and it's just great to have her around,

716
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,360
 and then you get in marriage,

717
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,680
 and it becomes not like she's so fun-loving,

718
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,640
 it's like, do you ever focus on anything?

719
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
 The guy, you're like, I just love that he's athletic,

720
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,020
 and then you get married, and you're like,

721
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,320
 all he cares about is sports, that's it,

722
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,160
 that's all he cares about.

723
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,360
 Whatever the thing that you're like, man,

724
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,480
 this is the thing that I really like about this person,

725
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,800
 all of a sudden, you find yourself going,

726
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
 man, I'm not sure that I like them,

727
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,080
 she's so sweet, turns into,

728
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,380
 she doesn't have an opinion or a backbone at all.

729
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,700
 That's where it begun.

730
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,080
 And in that moment, in those times,

731
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,080
 and in those scenarios, you have to make the decision,

732
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,720
 I am not going to listen to whatever lies

733
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
 I may be tempted to believe, I love this woman,

734
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,560
 I love this man, and I'm choosing to lay down my wife,

735
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,440
 to lay down my life, not my wife,

736
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,920
 (audience laughing)

737
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,440
 though if they let you,

738
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,000
 (audience laughing)

739
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,100
 in marriage, in marriage,

740
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,520
 (laughing)

741
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,600
 in marriage,

742
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,740
 I have lost my place.

743
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,100
 (audience laughing)

744
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,620
 You are choosing, hey, I'm putting the needs

745
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,780
 and the cares of this person in front of me.

746
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:20,400
 The Apostle Paul would say, here's what love does,

747
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,020
 in 1 Corinthians chapter 13,

748
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,900
 a verse that you probably heard before,

749
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,340
 love bears all things.

750
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,020
 (laughing)

751
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,180
 I apologize, man, I'm gonna get an email for that,

752
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,900
 let's just get that out of the way, I apologize, okay?

753
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,300
 Love bears all things, it endures all things,

754
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,900
 it believes all things.

755
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,640
 Hopes all things, love never ends.

756
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,120
 Love in marriage, I hope you never, ever

757
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,020
 wonder this question again, is a command.

758
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,620
 God commands it, and any husband and any wife

759
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,340
 who says, no, I'm not doing that,

760
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,920
 says, I reject the word of God,

761
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,900
 and I am choosing to live in rebellion against it.

762
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,260
 It is a command, it is not optional,

763
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,900
 and it is not feelings-based,

764
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,980
 and as you go into marriage, you need to make sure

765
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,580
 you have a lock on that idea,

766
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,860
 and that truth from God's word.

767
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,300
 You got a lot of expectations, you need to go in expecting,

768
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
 there's gonna be days I do not feel like this,

769
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,300
 and I'm gonna have to say, die to self,

770
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,060
 and I'm choosing to put you and your needs in front of me,

771
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,340
 and I don't want to, and I don't feel like it,

772
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,620
 and I'm choosing to do that.

773
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,740
 It's like this, all of us came into the room,

774
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,900
 and there's different expectations

775
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,940
 that fill kind of your mind and your heart

776
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,260
 as it relates to what your marriage life

777
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,140
 is gonna look like someday.

778
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,980
 Here's what different expectations you need to come out,

779
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,180
 here's an expectation you need to make sure,

780
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,140
 like, what do I mean by that?

781
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,860
 Like, truly, I remember being single,

782
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,060
 there's just different things you're thinking,

783
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,880
 whether it's like, when I'm gonna get married,

784
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,260
 what this person's gonna look like,

785
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,660
 what a wedding day's gonna look like,

786
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,980
 what kind of a life is gonna look like,

787
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,820
 so you're gonna go in there,

788
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,620
 and most of us in the room probably expect,

789
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,780
 maybe there's some of us that don't,

790
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,900
 but you're gonna get married someday,

791
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,820
 so here's your wedding ring, you're gonna get married,

792
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,220
 even the timing, you're like, yeah,

793
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,100
 probably before 30 for sure,

794
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,500
 but not 'til after 25, 'cause, you know,

795
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,540
 I gotta get some things in order,

796
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,780
 and so your expectation would be,

797
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,980
 hey, someday I'm gonna get married,

798
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,860
 and of course, of course, right?

799
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,460
 There's gonna be lots of great sex in marriage,

800
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,420
 that's a great expectation,

801
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,340
 and this is just an expectation

802
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,220
 that in your marriage box, if you will,

803
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,580
 you've got the expectation of,

804
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,660
 man, we're gonna have great sex,

805
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,900
 and maybe your expectation is someday,

806
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,940
 you know, we're gonna travel the world,

807
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,880
 we're gonna go see, what is this, Eiffel Tower, Paris,

808
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,520
 we're gonna see things together,

809
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,340
 and, oh, of course,

810
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,380
 some point we're gonna have little ones,

811
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,980
 and here we are just walking in the woods together,

812
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,220
 we're doing family photos,

813
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,340
 that's an expectation I have,

814
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,100
 and we're all dressing up here the same,

815
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,260
 and of course, we're doing matching pajama pictures

816
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,500
 at Christmas time, and this is your expectation,

817
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,740
 and you've got a million of 'em,

818
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,100
 some said, some unsaid, guys,

819
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,160
 you're probably going like,

820
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,640
 I don't even know exactly which ones I have expectations on,

821
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,900
 where's the sex one again?

822
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,260
 That's pretty much it.

823
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,940
 Whatever they are, but all of us came in the room

824
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,860
 with expectations,

825
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,260
 we got a dog in here for some reason?

826
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,420
 House, we're gonna have this white picket fence together,

827
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,220
 we're gonna wake up and have our quiet times,

828
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,260
 it's just gonna be incredible,

829
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,980
 it's always gonna be great, coffee, quiet time,

830
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,740
 yes, please, namaste in bed,

831
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,780
 then we're gonna grow old together,

832
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,820
 and sit on this park bench,

833
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,120
 somehow I've got another of the pajama things

834
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,040
 popping in here,

835
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,400
 all of those are great.

836
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,340
 I hope that every expectation that you have,

837
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,180
 and every hope and dream,

838
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,660
 and whatever those things that you've thought about,

839
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,700
 and this is gonna be so sweet,

840
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,840
 and I can't wait 'til all of those happen,

841
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,780
 and put 'em in your box,

842
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,260
 put 'em in the marriage expectation box,

843
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,980
 none of that is wrong.

844
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,340
 I wanna make sure you leave with the expectation

845
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,580
 that included in my box needs to be

846
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,740
 the covenant-keeping love,

847
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,060
 that aha, va, that I'm deciding to stay,

848
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,900
 even when it's really hard,

849
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,820
 even when I don't want to,

850
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,800
 I'm deciding that I'm going to love you,

851
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,060
 and sacrifice, and lay down my life for you.

852
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,900
 Biblically, the Bible says,

853
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,720
 "Greater love has no man than this,

854
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,540
 "than he lays down his life."

855
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,540
 And the decision in marriage is a constant

856
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,260
 on putting the needs of my spouse before myself.

857
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,580
 I'm choosing to be God's provision,

858
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,020
 and to be an extension of God's grace to this person,

859
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,980
 and to serve them, and to care of them,

860
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,700
 and I'm not going anywhere, no matter what happens.

861
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,580
 And you need to make sure that in that marriage box,

862
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,700
 you know it's gonna be hard,

863
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,540
 it's got lots of great things,

864
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,180
 and there's gonna be times where I am not going anywhere,

865
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,660
 and you need to make sure the person you marry,

866
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,340
 above everything else, has that in there,

867
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,420
 and that you, above any other expectation,

868
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,360
 have that in your marriage box.

869
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,100
 In conclusion, marriage is a covenant,

870
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,460
 and love inside of marriage is a choice.

871
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:46,180
 Song of Solomon has been God's design and celebration

872
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,340
 of just the incredible gift of romance.

873
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,120
 But as I wrap up, and I'm landing the plane,

874
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,860
 just having done this week after week,

875
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,020
 and seen it for the last 10 years,

876
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,220
 there's like this underlying lie

877
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
 that I think a lot of people believe,

878
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,340
 as it relates to marriage.

879
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,460
 And here's the lie,

880
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:12,400
 that marriage can fix and fill something empty inside of me.

881
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,940
 Like as soon as I get married, then life really begins,

882
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,560
 and then I can really experience satisfaction,

883
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,940
 and that's where life is,

884
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,820
 and until that, I'm just kind of on the waiting room,

885
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,560
 or I'm just waiting for life to begin.

886
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,960
 And it's a lie.

887
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,320
 As long as you look for someone,

888
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,560
 and that some person on this planet

889
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,640
 that can fill and fix some emptiness,

890
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,960
 or some void that you find inside of yourself,

891
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,800
 you are looking for a solution that will never work.

892
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,400
 Let me explain it like this.

893
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,740
 My favorite Apple product ever is the AirPods.

894
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,800
 Thank you.

895
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,440
 And I think this is like the greatest invention

896
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,280
 Apple has ever made.

897
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,840
 Anybody have AirPods in here before?

898
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
 Anybody have AirPods?

899
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,160
 You guys gotta get AirPods, like for real.

900
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,640
 Tonight, you should leave the application from this message.

901
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,760
 Go materialism.

902
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,480
 So AirPods, here's one of the things that I love about 'em.

903
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,560
 Like you can throw one in, I can take calls.

904
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,240
 It sounds like the phone's up in my ear.

905
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,140
 You know, I can double-click it, and it pauses the thing.

906
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,000
 I can have just one in, I can have both in,

907
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,480
 I can have the right in, I can have either.

908
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,820
 I can embed now, if my wife's going to bed,

909
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,620
 I can be like, hey, I'm gonna throw this in,

910
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,800
 watch some Netflix, or do whatever,

911
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,800
 and I can have that in my ear.

912
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,280
 And sometimes, if I do that, I'll wake up the next morning,

913
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,520
 and if you've ever slept with an AirPod in your ear,

914
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,840
 it's like on your forehead,

915
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,200
 or you're looking for it somewhere in the bed,

916
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,560
 and you can't find it.

917
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,240
 And inevitably, it's like run out of battery.

918
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,880
 And here's what's interesting about these AirPods,

919
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
 is there's two of 'em.

920
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,640
 They're a pair, a match, if you will.

921
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,900
 You got one, you got its mate.

922
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,280
 And when this thing is low on battery, you know what's crazy?

923
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,560
 And this thing has full battery,

924
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,340
 I can't get this to fill this thing up.

925
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,120
 It can't, despite the fact that they're really complimentary,

926
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,840
 I mean, they were made to work together,

927
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,880
 when they do work together, it's incredible,

928
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,240
 but when one is lacking something, or one is empty,

929
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,520
 despite the fact that this may have something,

930
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,560
 or have plenty inside of it,

931
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,600
 it cannot fill what is lacking,

932
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,360
 and what is empty in the other one.

933
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,080
 Marriage can fix your singleness,

934
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,400
 and address your singleness.

935
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,280
 It cannot fill your emptiness.

936
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,140
 And there is something inside of every single human heart,

937
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,320
 that from the moment that you were born,

938
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,720
 there has been a vacuum, or a hole inside of your heart,

939
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,560
 and the temptation for most people on the planet

940
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,200
 is to think, hey, you know what?

941
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,320
 I bet this person could fill what is lacking,

942
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,360
 what is empty inside of me.

943
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,480
 I bet if you come alongside, and they could fill,

944
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,220
 and you have bought a lie,

945
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,840
 because that hole was placed there by God,

946
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,520
 so that you would know, and reach out, and find Him,

947
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,360
 that it would lead you, and point you to Him.

948
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,240
 Marriage and love will not satisfy you,

949
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,280
 and if you are empty today,

950
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,720
 you will not experience a fullness,

951
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,920
 or a satisfaction tomorrow.

952
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,400
 You'll have it for about a week, and then it'll be gone.

953
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:10,360
 Solomon, tragically, never,

954
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,660
 or I guess he did learn it, he learned it the hard way.

955
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,120
 What do I mean?

956
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,420
 The lesson that marriage cannot satisfy you.

957
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,100
 Like love and marriage, it will not satisfy you.

958
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,680
 Getting married today, you don't have to wait

959
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,720
 to get over your singleness,

960
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,360
 you don't have to wait 'til you're married someday.

961
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,640
 It's not going to fill some hole in your heart.

962
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,680
 And Solomon, his story from here,

963
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,720
 it really is kind of tragic.

964
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,160
 I don't know if you know much of the story

965
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,800
 of Song of Solomon, it's kind of the irony of the book.

966
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,360
 As he starts off, he's this young king,

967
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,840
 and they have this amazing marriage.

968
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,280
 They write a love song together.

969
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,940
 It's a manual on sex and romance,

970
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,520
 and you would think if anybody in the world,

971
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,580
 they got it, they're the couple to look to,

972
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,260
 and of course, they're growing old,

973
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,520
 sitting on that park bench together somewhere.

974
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,600
 It was not the case.

975
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,880
 Solomon didn't find the love he was looking for

976
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,460
 in this relationship, and eventually it grew cold.

977
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,540
 And one decision after the next after the next,

978
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,980
 Solomon was king.

979
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,540
 And we're told in 1 Kings chapter 11,

980
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,220
 that he decided to look for a filling of void

981
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,420
 and a hole in his heart.

982
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,220
 And one of the ways he did it was after marriage,

983
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,860
 after marriage, after marriage.

984
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,260
 Here's what it says, 1 Kings chapter 11,

985
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,100
 verse two through four.

986
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,380
 "There were nations from which the Lord

987
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,840
 "had told the Israelites,

988
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,980
 "you must not intermarry with them."

989
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,580
 So God had said, hey, there's some people,

990
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,540
 I don't want you to intermarry,

991
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,240
 "because they will turn your hearts after other gods."

992
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,360
 Hey, you marry foreign women or foreign men,

993
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,860
 you're gonna worship foreign gods, so don't do that.

994
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,000
 "Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.

995
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,660
 "He had 700 wives,

996
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,540
 "and 300 concubines,"

997
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,500
 which is just like a live-in girlfriend

998
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,440
 not officially married to.

999
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,540
 "And his wives led him astray.

1000
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,400
 "And as Solomon grew old,

1001
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,820
 "his wives turned his heart after gods,

1002
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,480
 "and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God,

1003
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,540
 "as the heart of David his father had been."

1004
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,860
 Think about that.

1005
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,500
 Like we read past the verse and it's like 700,

1006
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,580
 oh yeah, that's kinda cool, it's in the Bible,

1007
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,540
 I don't get most of the stuff in here.

1008
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,460
 Think about that.

1009
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,540
 700 times he stood before a woman

1010
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,660
 and said, "Man, she's it.

1011
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
 "She's the one."

1012
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,220
 You gotta be thinking at some point he's going,

1013
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,500
 this is gonna be the love that finally fills,

1014
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,980
 I'm like, this is the girl.

1015
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,460
 And we don't know what happened exactly.

1016
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,500
 Maybe Shulamith died.

1017
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,060
 Maybe she died and their love story was over

1018
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,940
 and out of his heartbreak he just spent one day

1019
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,340
 after the next after looking for some sort of love

1020
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,520
 that could fill that hole

1021
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,940
 that he felt was left behind from her.

1022
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,100
 We're not told any of that, we don't know.

1023
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,620
 But 700 times he stood in front of another woman

1024
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,300
 and said, "Man, she's it.

1025
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,500
 "She's gonna be the one."

1026
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,740
 And it didn't satisfy.

1027
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,980
 And he kept chasing and he kept chasing

1028
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
 and he kept looking and he kept looking.

1029
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,660
 The love that you are looking for

1030
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,380
 is not in some other person.

1031
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,940
 And Solomon discovered that after hundreds of times.

1032
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,420
 I mean, he was getting married every day

1033
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,580
 for two years straight.

1034
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,820
 And he came up empty.

1035
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,540
 And it cost him.

1036
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,380
 Because of his decision and his heart getting turned,

1037
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,220
 God said, "I'm ripping the kingdom from your son's hand."

1038
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,580
 And Solomon in his old age,

1039
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,420
 we're told that he writes this book called Ecclesiastes.

1040
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,220
 Ecclesiastes was what he wrote at the end of his life

1041
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,540
 and he writes and he basically goes like,

1042
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,620
 "Man, I've chased everything.

1043
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,200
 "I chased women, I chased the party,

1044
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,560
 "I chased building, I chased success.

1045
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
 "I got more money than you, I got more ladies than you,

1046
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,520
 "I got more cribs than you,

1047
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,220
 "I got more than you will ever have."

1048
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,460
 And I'm just telling you, this is the point of the book.

1049
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,100
 All of it is meaningless.

1050
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,260
 Unless you get beyond the sun.

1051
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,300
 That's how he puts it in the book.

1052
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,540
 Underneath the sun, all of this stuff is meaningless.

1053
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,820
 And he gives the inference like,

1054
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,700
 "Unless you can get beyond the sun,"

1055
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,620
 or what translation?

1056
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,280
 "Outside of this world, you will never find

1057
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,200
 "the love you're looking for,

1058
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,300
 "the satisfaction you are looking for."

1059
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,600
 Friends, some of you came in here tonight

1060
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,740
 and you are so discouraged and so just beat down

1061
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,820
 by the fact that you're not married

1062
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,700
 and you have bought this lie that one day,

1063
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,100
 "If I just got married, I'd be satisfied."

1064
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,660
 And the story of Solomon is that you are looking for a love

1065
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,300
 that you're not gonna find in the arms of another man

1066
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,020
 or the arms of another woman.

1067
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,540
 And he did it 700 times and he came up empty.

1068
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,180
 Because it is a hole that God placed there.

1069
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,740
 And Solomon wrote that.

1070
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,300
 In his old age, he wrote this in Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11,

1071
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,700
 as we finish the plane.

1072
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,560
 "God has made everything beautiful in its time."

1073
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,900
 Listen to this.

1074
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:46,620
 "He has put eternity into man's heart."

1075
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,500
 What does that mean?

1076
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,540
 It means there's a hole in your heart

1077
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:01,860
 that nothing, unless it is eternal, can fill.

1078
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,180
 Because God put it there.

1079
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,940
 And he put it there so that you would have this ache

1080
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,500
 every single day and every time that you go

1081
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,460
 into a relationship and it never satisfies,

1082
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,540
 where you would go, "Man, there's gotta be something else

1083
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,820
 "beyond the sun.

1084
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,260
 "There's gotta be something in this life

1085
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,360
 "or something out there that could fill this ache

1086
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,180
 "in this hole that is there."

1087
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,440
 And God said, "I put that there

1088
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,600
 "so you'll constantly look to me."

1089
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,780
 The love that you have been looking for,

1090
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,820
 the love that you were born for.

1091
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,100
 And man, I hope you get this so bad beyond anything else.

1092
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,340
 And some of you are getting this.

1093
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,280
 What you're discovering, and your singleness right now

1094
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,500
 is not the defining characteristic of your life.

1095
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
 Like you came in here tonight and you're like,

1096
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,340
 "Yeah, I'm single.

1097
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,300
 "I don't know if I'm ever gonna get married."

1098
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,940
 But Jesus, you're enough.

1099
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,540
 You're all I want.

1100
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,460
 You're all I've ever wanted.

1101
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,460
 You're all that I need and everything that I want

1102
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,420
 in this life and will you give me more of yourself

1103
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,180
 and help me to trust you and know you and walk with you?

1104
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,580
 And it's like the more that you begin to know

1105
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,740
 and walk with God, the more you experience that.

1106
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,480
 And I know you're going, "Oh, it's easy for you to say,

1107
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,600
 "you know, because you're married."

1108
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,060
 I can tell you as someone who is married,

1109
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,300
 it doesn't satisfy.

1110
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,260
 If you're sitting in the audience and you're going,

1111
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,420
 "Yeah, I mean, God would be great

1112
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,260
 "and heaven would be awesome,

1113
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,280
 "but you know, I still just wanna get married

1114
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,300
 "and God, please don't come back till I get married."

1115
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,420
 Think about that.

1116
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,140
 That's saying, I mean, heaven's great,

1117
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,660
 but I think marriage would probably be better than heaven.

1118
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,820
 And as someone who has been married for seven years,

1119
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,420
 it is not, it's amazing.

1120
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,700
 It's not the love you were looking for.

1121
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,780
 It won't fill the hole in your heart

1122
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,120
 because it wasn't designed to.

1123
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,520
 And as long as you think it will,

1124
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,380
 you're gonna put expectations on your mate

1125
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,260
 in that relationship.

1126
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,300
 Fill me up.

1127
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,100
 Fill me up.

1128
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,520
 And it can't unless it is connected to a source of life.

1129
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,880
 And in this circumstance with us,

1130
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,500
 the source of life is not some charger,

1131
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,340
 it is God, your creator, who loves you,

1132
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,740
 who proved that love by dying in your place.

1133
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,640
 That is the love you've been looking for your entire life.

1134
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,560
 And it is the love that your entire life,

1135
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,100
 you'll either walk with, accept, and experience,

1136
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,660
 or you will continue to look for it

1137
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,160
 because here's what I promise.

1138
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,340
 You're not gonna find it in marriage.

1139
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:17,580
 But that love is looking for you if you'll accept it.

1140
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,920
 And it's a love that perfectly displayed itself to you

1141
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,120
 2,000 years ago.

1142
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,260
 Where the lover of your soul and the one you were made for

1143
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,020
 became a man and died for you and for me,

1144
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,500
 for anyone who trusts in him.

1145
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,300
 Let me pray.

1146
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,220
 Father, I pray.

1147
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:42,260
 God, I pray for every dating couple in this room

1148
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,340
 and listening right now online

1149
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,600
 and listening at different 17 locations

1150
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,500
 that you would protect them from making a decision

1151
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,000
 and marrying someone who is not your will,

1152
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,440
 who doesn't love you and doesn't know you,

1153
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,020
 who will not be a wife or a husband or a mom

1154
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,940
 or a father someday, who will honor you and walk with you.

1155
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,660
 Would you break them up, God, tonight

1156
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,620
 as they listen and hear my voice at a later time,

1157
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,780
 would you break them up?

1158
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,980
 I pray for any engaged couple, would you protect them

1159
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,180
 and would they pursue purity?

1160
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,620
 I pray, God, would you raise up a generation of people

1161
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,740
 who know you and walk with you and they marry together

1162
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,020
 for the purpose not of fulfilling each other

1163
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,320
 but fulfilling the mission you put us on the planet for,

1164
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,080
 knowing you and making you known.

1165
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,660
 Would you raise up inside of this room

1166
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,900
 hundreds and hundreds of marriages

1167
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,500
 and to those listening in other places,

1168
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,180
 hundreds of marriages who know that the ultimate meaning

1169
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,740
 in life is not from marriage, it comes from you.

1170
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:40,420
 And would you destroy and end relationships

1171
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,040
 and your spirit be heavy on anyone

1172
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,540
 who doesn't need to be in one?

1173
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,220
 I pray for healing, God, for sexual abuse

1174
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,480
 that's taken place, baggage that we carry,

1175
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,880
 that you would just work and heal in our hearts.

1176
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,140
 I pray for pornography addictions that need to end,

1177
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,540
 that you would kill them, you would expose them.

1178
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,980
 I pray that you would make us incredible lovers

1179
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,300
 because we love and know you, make us servants, God.

1180
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,900
 Would we decrease and you increase?

1181
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,040
 In Jesus's name, amen.

1182
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:23,040
