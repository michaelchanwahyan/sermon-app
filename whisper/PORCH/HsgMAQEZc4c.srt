00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 How we doing?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Shout out to Fort Worth and Houston and Tulsa and El Paso and Chicago and Florida and South Africa.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Young adults around the world, changing the world. I love it.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 It's so great to be with you guys. So great to be with you guys.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I want to start this evening by introducing you to someone.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 His name is Vinny and he desires to be a genderless alien.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And so what that means is he has spent $50,000 on over 110 procedures to make him a genderless alien.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 He's had two rhinoplasty's, he's had cheek implants, brow implants, lip filler, lots of surgeries, lots of money spent.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Here he is. There is Vinny. He has plans to spend... Nice.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Yeah, he'll be waiting for you up front.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 He has plans to spend another $160,000 on removing his genitals, his nipples, and his belly button.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 No whistle on that? Okay, alright.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 It sounds crazy, huh? Sounds crazy.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 The source of what he's doing is not crazy. It's not out of the ordinary.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It's not abnormal. Not even strange. Really, really normal.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 See, the source of what Vinny's doing is he's following his heart.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 That's the advice. I watched him on Botched and a couple other interviews that he did.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And that's the advice his friends have given him.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 "Hey, Vinny, you should do whatever you feel like doing. If that's what you feel like, if you feel like a non-sexual alien, then that is what you should become."

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And you and I are guilty of the exact same things that he's doing.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And maybe we can pull it off better than he is. Maybe we don't look so noticeably different as he does.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 But all of us have followed our feelings, our emotions, our gut.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 This thing that we have inside that takes us in and out of jobs and in and out of relationships.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 You say, "I don't want to work. I want to work wherever I feel like working."

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Or, "I don't feel like doing this job anymore, so I'm leaving."

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So it's just to say, "I don't enjoy it," or "I'm not fulfilled by it."

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Or, "I want to date whoever I feel like dating. I want to buy whatever I feel like buying. I want to do whatever I feel like doing."

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And if I'm close to God or not, it's determined by how I feel.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 In fact, some of us don't have any other matrix for making decisions but how we feel.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 That's become really, really normal today.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 You look at a decision and you ask the question, "Well, if I'm going to go right or left, I'm going to base that decision on how I feel."

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And that's really normal in 2017, but the Scripture tells us something really, really different.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And so I want you to think about your most shameful moment.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Maybe it was waking up to a stranger or looking at something that wasn't yours or lying in bed with the room spinning.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Maybe it's all of those things. Maybe it's something bigger.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Maybe it's deep regret that you felt from a decision that you made and you're wondering how you got there.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And I want you to know how you got there, just like Vinny did.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 You got there following your desires.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 You got there doing what you wanted to do.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And you think, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but JP, I'm not like alien boy."

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Maybe not.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 But some of the decisions that you'll make in your life are even less reversible than 110 procedures on your face.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And you can get there the exact same way.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 So we're in this series called "Bad Advice," where we're going to look at advice that the world gives us,

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 advice that your friends and your coworkers and maybe your family would say, "Hey, this is what you should do."

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And we're going to take that advice that's common today in today's culture,

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 and we're going to compare it to what the Scriptures say.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 This old, dusty book that was written by the creator of the heavens and the earth, given to us to follow it.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I've never done what it said and regretted it many times.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I've not done what it said and regretted it every time.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 We're going to see some advice from thousands of years ago that I think you're going to see remarkably applicable to your life today.

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 The advice that Vinny followed from his friends was very simple.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 It's advice you followed.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 It's follow your heart.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Follow your heart.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Bad advice number one, follow your heart.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And so when we follow our feelings, when we make decisions based on our feelings,

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 we alienate ourselves from truth, which can be far more damaging than plastic surgery.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 See, the Scripture says in Jeremiah 17, verse 9, that the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Who can understand it?

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And you say, but wait, JP, wait.

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I've heard that the Holy Spirit gives me a new heart.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 When I trust it in Jesus, I've got a clean heart, a pure heart.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 That's only half the story, Jeremiah 17, verse 9.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 In fact, Romans 6, verse 17 says this, "But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin,

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance."

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I sought to reconcile these two ideas.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I asked an incredible theologian and friend of mine, Todd, and just said, "Hey, can we trust our regenerate heart, our new heart?"

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And he said, "Yes, but until you're with Christ, your degenerate heart or old heart is never fully dead.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And your new heart, your believing heart, your heart with God's Spirit is still corruptible by the things that you engage yourself in this world."

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 This is very important for us to understand, and it's what the Scripture teaches tonight.

73
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And so I want to convince you that if you fill your heart with the wrong things, it impacts what you are attracted to, how you think.

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It causes destructive patterns in your life.

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And in fact, you will waste your life chasing the next fleeting pursuit of your heart.

76
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But if you fill your heart with the things of God, you will find healthy thinking, healthy living.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 You will find life and have it abundantly.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Who doesn't want an abundant, full life?

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So we're going to be in Proverbs chapter 4 this evening.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 The first nine chapters of Proverbs to set this up, it's written by a father speaking to a young child.

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Solomon is most likely recorded these.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 It's ten lectures, and all the lectures have the same basic message.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 It's this, "Value wisdom. Seek to become wise. Listen to the Father's teaching, and it will lead you to life."

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And so we're going to look at lecture 7 here in Proverbs chapter 4.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I'm going to read the whole thing, and we'll draw out some instructions, specifically how we don't follow an unguarded heart,

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 what happens if you do, and how we, before you leave, how we inform our heart.

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So Proverbs 4, starting in verse 20.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 It says, "My son, pay attention."

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 In the Hebrew, this is like a...

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 That's what I do with my kids.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Hey, look at me. Look at Daddy.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 That's what it's saying here.

93
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 "My son, pay attention to what I say. Turn your ear to my words.

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Do not let them out of your sight. Keep them within your heart."

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 See, your heart is a storage container for truth.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 It's a storage container.

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 You can put lies in it. You can put truth in it.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You can put whatever you want, but it's telling us it's where you store things.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 "For they are life to those who find them, and health to ones whole body."

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 That's the promise of this text, is life and health.

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And then it says this, this is a very familiar text.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 "Ladies, above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it."

103
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 This is not just a text to women about dating.

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Okay, that's not.

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Men, I want you to listen to this.

106
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 You're going to learn a lot this evening, too.

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 "Keep your mouth free from perversity. Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.

109
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Give careful thought to the paths of your feet, and be steadfast in all your ways.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Do not turn to the right or the left. Keep your foot far from evil."

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 We're going to unpack this text.

112
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So the scripture, it's saying right here, it doesn't say follow your heart, it says to guard it.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 My first point is this, don't follow an unguarded heart.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Don't follow an unguarded heart.

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Verse 23, verse half, "Above all else, guard your heart."

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 What does it mean?

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It means this, "Be careful what you let in."

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Do we think about this enough, what we're letting in our heart?

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 This word for guard, it's how you would guard a castle in this time.

120
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Somebody armed would stand up front, and they would be ready to kill with force any enemy that is willing to come in.

121
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 They would take them with force, saying, "This is how you guard your heart.

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 You protect it. You decide what goes on."

123
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 You protect it. You decide what goes in and what comes out with an armed soldier.

124
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And it's not just this command, like I said, for ladies who are dating.

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 It's very relevant. It says to keep your heart.

126
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 That word keep, your text might say keep, it's like preserve it, like keep it from going bad, like did the milk keep?

127
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And it's telling us something really key.

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Your heart can go bad.

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Your heart can spoil.

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Your heart can turn on you.

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 It can become this untrustworthy thing.

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And he says, "Above all else."

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Maybe yours says, "With all vigilance or with all diligence."

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 He's saying more than anything.

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Why would he say God?

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 God, the creator, the one you believe in, if you're here and you're a follower of Christ, you've trusted in this God,

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 you've got your life in his hands, and he's telling you something really key.

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 More than you guard anything, guard your heart.

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 More than you guard your truck with an alarm.

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 More than you guard your apartment with an alarm.

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 More than you would put your money in an FDIC-insured bank with pillars and a vault.

142
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 More than you'd guard any other single thing that you possess.

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Spend more time, energy, and resources into guarding your heart.

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 The heart is the most protected vital organ, but we're not talking about that thing that pumps blood inside of you.

145
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 We're talking about your emotional quotient.

146
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 We're talking about the inner core of a person, your thoughts, your feelings, your desires, your values, your will,

147
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 and choices that make a person who he or she is.

148
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 That's what we're talking about.

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Your heart.

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And it's fragile and valuable and powerful.

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 You protect things that are fragile and valuable and powerful.

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Why?

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Think about it for a minute.

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Recently I got some terrible news.

155
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 A dear friend of ours, they were pregnant.

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 We celebrated that, and they lost their baby in the womb.

157
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So sad.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I was grieving with them.

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 My day was going great.

160
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Everything was going great.

161
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I was working on this message, actually.

162
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 All things were, you know, birds chirping, sun shining, sky's blue, temperature's perfect.

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 All is right in the world.

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And this news comes into my heart by way of my ears, through my brain, into my emotional quotient,

165
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 and turns my world upside down in a moment.

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And all of a sudden the world fades to gray scale.

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Food, I ate at my favorite place, ate my favorite burger on this day, and just tasted blah.

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 God felt far.

169
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Not that he was far, he felt far.

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 You ever done that?

171
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Maybe for you it wasn't the loss of a child.

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Maybe it was a breakup.

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 You ever done this?

174
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Woke up not feeling like you wanted to get out of bed.

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Like everything's wrong.

176
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Maybe some of you are right there right now, but others of you, you can remember where you were.

177
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 You're not there right now.

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 You've healed.

179
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Times change things, but in that moment it felt hopeless.

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Why?

181
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Because your heart, something crept in your heart and turned it.

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And it turned your life.

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Do you see how powerful this is?

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Feelings, they're so powerful.

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 You guys ever seen Pixar's Inside Out?

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I'm sorry, it's going to be a tough illustration.

187
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I'm interested in Pixar.

188
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 They're so good at what they do, and I've learned in reading about them how they make these blockbusters.

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 They ask a simple question, and it's this question, "What if blank had feelings?"

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 You tracking with me?

191
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 They ask, "Hey, what if something had feelings?"

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Some of you are confused.

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Let me give you an example.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 In 1995, they asked, "What if toys had feelings?"

195
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 What's that?

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Okay, in '98, they asked, "What if bugs had feelings?"

197
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Okay, okay.

198
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And then they asked in 2001, "What if monsters had feelings?"

199
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Okay, now we're playing.

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And then they said, "What if fish had feelings?"

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Yeah, and then they said, "What if cars had feelings?"

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And then they said, "What if rats had feelings?"

203
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And then they said, "What if robots had feelings?"

204
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And then they asked, "What if Scotland had feelings?"

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Okay, that was a tough one.

206
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And then do you know what they asked in 2015?

207
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 "What if feelings had feelings?"

208
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Yeah, Inside Out.

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Eager, like, "Pixar!"

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 "What if feelings had feelings?"

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And you see this, the plot is this little girl, Riley,

212
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 and she has these five emotions that are personified inside of her,

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 and they're joy and sadness, fear, disgust, and anger.

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And then what happens as the plot moves forward is sadness and joy get lost,

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 leaving only disgust, fear, and anger,

216
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 kind of personifying, basically, adolescence.

217
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And you see this girl and her life and where her feelings carry her.

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I mean, is there anything greater than feeling pure joy,

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 and anything worse than sitting in deep sorrow?

220
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 I tell you that.

221
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I'm trying to make the point that this text wants you to understand

222
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 is how you feel is powerful.

223
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 In fact, it's so powerful, it takes you places.

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 It takes you places.

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 It carries you somewhere.

226
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 That's what he's saying.

227
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 We guard our heart because everything in our life flows from it.

228
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Second point, an unguarded heart will lead you astray.

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 An unguarded heart will lead you astray.

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 This is what he's saying in the second part of this verse in 23.

231
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Everything you do flows from it.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I have my girls tell me this verse every single day before I drop them off at school.

233
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Proverbs 4:23, every day.

234
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Why?

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Because if your heart is not doing well, then you're not doing well.

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 If your heart's not okay, then you're not okay.

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And what goes in your heart determines what comes out of your words

238
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and your actions and your life.

239
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Matthew 15 says it like this,

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 "But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart,

241
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 "and these defile them.

242
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 "For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality,

243
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 "theft, false testimony, and slander,

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 "and these are what defile a person."

245
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 A little over a year ago,

246
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 my girl's grandparents, Monica's parents,

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 got them iPod Touches for Christmas.

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 iPod Touch, they call them their phones

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 because they're like an iPhone, but they just don't make calls.

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 They're like an iPad Mini.

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And so they have these things, they call their phones.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And I watched as everything about them changed,

253
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 this little bitty device.

254
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They would wake up in the morning,

255
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 and they used to come into our room, first thing.

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 They would go into the living room, they'd grab their phone off the charger,

257
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 and they'd begin to play these games.

258
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I watched how it affected their mood.

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I watched how they would fight over them and argue over them.

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 I watched how if their phone ran out of battery,

261
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 then all of a sudden they were grumpy.

262
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And I watched how they started, like, the way they talked changed,

263
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 and they would say weird things like, "Daddy, I gotta go check on my dragons."

264
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It was some weird game or something.

265
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And I'm like, "Why do you gotta check on your dragons?"

266
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And they're like, "Oh, because, Daddy, they're making babies."

267
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 I'm like, "What kind of dragons are these?

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 "What is your mother letting you do?"

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And I'm watching this, and I'm like, "This is crazy."

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And I went to talk to them. I sat them both down.

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And I said, "Girls, I think you're addicted to your phones."

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And they said, "Daddy, aren't you addicted to your phone?"

273
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And so I kicked them out.

274
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Aren't these little LCD screens like IVs into our heart?

275
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Are they not feeding our heart?

276
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Whether it's TV or computer or a phone,

277
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 just pumping information into our heart?

278
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And see, what we see determines what we think,

279
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 which determines how we feel, which determines what we do.

280
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 What we see determines what we think,

281
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 which determines how we feel, which determines what we do.

282
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 In fact, what goes into our heart determines what flows out of our life.

283
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And I see it every single day, week in and week out.

284
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I'll stand up here, and somebody will come up,

285
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 and it'll be some sweet young lady.

286
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 "JP, I need help." "Why do you need help?"

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "How can I help you? How can I pray for you? What can I do for you?"

288
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 "JP, man, you just, man, I only date losers."

289
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 "I don't know what's wrong with me."

290
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 "It seems I'm only attracted to losers, bad guys."

291
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 "What's wrong with me? Help me. Got a magic verse or something."

292
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Let me ask you a few questions.

293
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Will you answer these questions honestly?

294
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Sure, sure, I'll answer them honestly.

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 They didn't even ask about purity or something.

296
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 All right, what's your favorite TV shows, and what's your favorite songs?

297
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 "Oh, JP, no, man, I'm asking dating advice."

298
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 "Dating advice? Oh, no, no, we're going to get to that in just a second.

299
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Just humor me for a moment.

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 What's your favorite shows? What's your favorite songs?"

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 "Oh, man, I don't know, dude. I don't know, man.

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Two Broke Girls, you've seen that? It's pretty funny."

303
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 "13 Reasons Why," I've been binging on Netflix.

304
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 "The Bachelorette," new season.

305
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Favorite songs, I don't know, man.

306
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I don't know, you know.

307
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Ed Sheeran, "Shape of You."

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 "I'm in love with your body."

309
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 You know that one? It's Lil' Drake, Lil' Jason Derulo.

310
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I don't know, man. Calvin Harris, Nicki Minaj.

311
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Lil' Weezy, I don't know.

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 What? What? Dating advice.

313
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Oh, man, I solved the mystery.

314
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I know your problem. I know what's wrong with you.

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 You've gone to a university that has slowly educated you how to date losers.

316
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 You basically have fed your heart slow information

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 that over time has taught you to be a professional loser dater.

318
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 That's what you've become.

319
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 It was a slow, meticulous plot by the enemy

320
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 to get you to a place where you would either never get married,

321
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 be horribly married, resent life, resent the opposite sex,

322
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 and have no idea what your problem is,

323
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 all the while singing these familiar tunes that you love

324
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 while they carry you to a place further from where you want to be.

325
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Doesn't it sound like something your mother would tell you?

326
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I mean, does that not sound like something your Sunday school teacher--

327
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I know what I sound like right now.

328
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 #dadlife, I get it, okay?

329
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 But I'm just telling you God's on to something.

330
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 My daughter comes in, she was singing--what is the song?

331
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Oh, man, what was it?

332
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It was like, "Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sipping,

333
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 "yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missing.

334
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 "Hey, hey, that looks like a toupee.

335
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 "I make what you make in 10 years in two days."

336
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I'm like--

337
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 You don't make anything.

338
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 What are you saying right now?

339
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 She's like, "I don't know.

340
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 "The girls at school were singing it."

341
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 It's funny, right?

342
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 It's funny.

343
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 You don't know either.

344
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 You don't know.

345
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 You don't know what he's saying.

346
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Something about a model chick and Lamborghini, top missing, toupee.

347
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 What's that got to do with anything?

348
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 You don't know.

349
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 You have no idea.

350
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 He's feeding this thing.

351
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 He's just feeding it.

352
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Don't sing stuff you don't know.

353
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 You hear me?

354
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It's taking you somewhere.

355
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Why do I look in the rear view mirror and all I see is broken relationships?

356
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 It's what you trained for.

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Am I wrong?

358
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Is the wisest man who's ever walked the planet Earth wrong?

359
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Is the creator of the heavens and the Earth wrong?

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Or maybe you're wrong.

361
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Something to consider.

362
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 If you're not careful with your heart, you're going to be somewhere.

363
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 You're going to end up somewhere you don't want to be.

364
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 A marriage you don't want to be in, an addiction that you can't shake,

365
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 a harmful relationship, despair.

366
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 All the while, the world is telling you to trust your heart, to follow your heart,

367
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 to listen to your heart.

368
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I go to a bunch of stories about this, a lot of personal stories,

369
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 a lot of folks I've talked to, but one I'll put in front of you is

370
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Director Woody Allen, who left his wife, Mia Farrow, for her daughter,

371
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 his stepdaughter, had an affair with his stepdaughter.

372
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And he was interviewed by Time Magazine, and they said,

373
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 "How could you do this?"

374
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And he had this infamous line, "The heart wants what it wants."

375
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 "The heart wants what it wants."

376
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Doesn't that sound beautiful?

377
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Doesn't that just sound to completely justify having an extramarital affair

378
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 with your daughter?

379
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 "The heart wants what it wants."

380
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Interesting, the way that he was caught is his wife, Mia Farrow,

381
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 found nude pictures of her daughter in his possession.

382
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And what I'm here to tell you is the heart doesn't want what it wants.

383
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 The heart wants what it's fed.

384
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 The heart doesn't want what it wants.

385
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It wants what it's fed, what it's taught, what it's told,

386
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 what it's instructed, what it's shown over time.

387
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The heart wants what it's fed.

388
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 You feed your heart.

389
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 It's like a bloodhound on a search, seeking the next thing to devour.

390
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It wants more of whatever you gave it.

391
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 It's the lie of one last time.

392
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I'm going to look at porn one last time.

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 You fed something, an appetite that grew from that one last time.

394
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 That was the lie you believed, and it's killing you.

395
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 It's killing you, our heart.

396
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 It works like Netflix.

397
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Remember that line on Netflix, the "because you watched" line?

398
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You can't get away with looking at something you shouldn't on Netflix

399
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 because your roommates will be like, "Oh, I see, because you watched that,

400
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 here's all that," right?

401
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 You know, the laughter of familiarity is like, "Hey, here's the deal.

402
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 It's like because you saw that, you should see this and this and this and this.

403
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Because you watched that one, watch this one, watch this."

404
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Your heart works that way.

405
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 It's like, "Oh, you want to look at that? Let me give you more.

406
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Let me give you more. Look, it's over there. Look, it's over there.

407
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 It's over there. It's over there."

408
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 It's like a bloodhound, right?

409
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And it feeds and it changes the way that we think.

410
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 My wife and I will watch Fixer Upper.

411
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 You guys ever see Fixer Upper?

412
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Like we're watching Fixer Upper.

413
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I'm like, "Man, that's amazing, all the shiplap, and that's awesome."

414
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Listen, babe, listen, I think that we should sell our perfectly good house

415
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 and buy a condemned house so that we can fix it up.

416
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 It's a great idea.

417
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 We'll watch Shark Tank, you know?

418
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And then all of a sudden I'm walking around, I'm like,

419
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 "Dude, I could totally--I got this idea for this invention, so hold your phone.

420
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I just need to talk to Mark Cuban. It's going to be amazing, you know?"

421
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 You watch The Bachelor, and you're like,

422
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 "I want to go on a date with 28 guys or girls or whatever.

423
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 That seems like a good idea."

424
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And you're like, "No, I don't, no, I don't."

425
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 But you're jealous of someone who did.

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 How crazy is that?

427
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 You envy and covet someone who did.

428
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Why? Because you fed your heart.

429
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 That's why.

430
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's not complicated.

431
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Social media, man, that's a big one.

432
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I had to delete Instagram from my phone because you guys,

433
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 you all like live on a vacation.

434
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Holy cow, like some of you live in Hawaii or something.

435
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Like everywhere I look, I mean, just today I look at Instagram,

436
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 and David Marvin is in Mexico with his wife,

437
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 and my day was going perfectly fine, and all of a sudden I'm like,

438
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "Why am I not in Mexico?"

439
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 You know?

440
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 I'm here doing David's job.

441
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Like, "What's up with that?

442
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 I need to get on a beach somewhere."

443
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And it's just, heart, man.

444
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 You're feeding it.

445
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 It takes you places.

446
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 So don't follow your heart.

447
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Inform your heart.

448
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 That's worth writing down, tweeting, sending out, posting,

449
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 spray painting under a bridge.

450
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 No, don't do that.

451
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Don't follow your heart.

452
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Inform your heart.

453
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 My third point is don't follow your heart until you inform your heart.

454
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 See, when my girls were addicted to their phones, as their dad,

455
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 I didn't know what to do, which is stupid,

456
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 because I can just say, "Mine.

457
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Stop that."

458
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I can close that off.

459
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And there's a war over the real estate of our hearts.

460
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And so the wisest man ever to live is going to give us three things to consider,

461
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 verses 24 through 27, and we'll end with this.

462
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 He says, "First of all, I want you to keep your mouth free of perversity.

463
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.

464
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 This is how you guard your heart.

465
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Watch what you say."

466
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 One of the ways that you can guard your heart is you watch what you say.

467
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Don't entertain perverse talk, Ephesians 4:29,

468
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 "Let no one hold some talk come out of your mouth,

469
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 but only what is helpful for building others up,

470
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 so that it may benefit those who listen."

471
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Stop gossiping. Stop slandering. Stop cursing.

472
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Stop talking, "Oh, man, wow, look at her.

473
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Wow, what I do with that."

474
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Stop it.

475
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 You're not in junior high locker room.

476
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Be careful what you say.

477
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 It's affecting your heart and your life.

478
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Even sarcasm, like sarcasm can poison your heart

479
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 if you give yourself to it.

480
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And you're like, "Man, dude, Sunday school talk."

481
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Run your little experiment.

482
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Like, leave here and see if I'm right.

483
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Test it. Test all things.

484
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 See what happens when you say those words,

485
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 when you sing those lyrics,

486
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 even though you don't know what they mean,

487
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 what it does to your heart.

488
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Let me show you what it does.

489
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 If this is your heart, it does this.

490
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 It just starts making it a little bit cloudy.

491
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 A little bit cloudy.

492
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 You're like, "Man, it doesn't even look cloudy right there.

493
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I don't even see any cloudy."

494
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 But just a little bit, it just throws a tinge on this thing,

495
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 this thing that you want to follow

496
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 just gets a little darker.

497
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Verse 25, "Let your eyes look straight ahead.

498
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Fix your gaze directly before you."

499
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 This is a big one.

500
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 "Be careful what you look at,

501
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 because what you look at, you're feeding your heart."

502
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And far too often, as I've said many times,

503
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 far too often we're entertained by the things Christ died for.

504
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Let me go close to home on this one.

505
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 A couple weeks ago, a friend of mine called me,

506
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 and I love good movies.

507
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Man, if you see a good movie, holler at your boy.

508
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 I love good movies.

509
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And he's like, "Hey, you've got to see this movie."

510
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And so I watch it.

511
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I ask him, I always ask, "Hey, is there any nudity?"

512
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 He's like, "No, no nudity."

513
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 So I watch it, but it just kind of glorified the club scene,

514
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 the party scene, the past life, the old me.

515
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And then in one scene, there's one scene for just a moment,

516
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 dude's in a club, and it's not even a strip club,

517
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 but there's these two girls wearing hardly anything,

518
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 dancing on a table, and I see it, and it doesn't take long,

519
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 and I'd love to tell you, he's like, "Man, I'm a pastor at the porch

520
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 "and a lover of Jesus, and so I cut it off

521
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 "and ran the other direction."

522
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 But I didn't.

523
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I didn't.

524
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 I continued to just spoon-feed my heart.

525
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And the next day, you know what happened?

526
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 I woke up, and I noticed every curvy girl in my path,

527
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 like girls I'm not married to, and others than my wife, Monica.

528
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And my head's on a swill, like, "Oh, wow, what's wrong with me?

529
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 "Oh, I remember I fed my heart for about 22 seconds,

530
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 "a scene in a movie that wasn't even what the world would call pornographic,

531
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 "and it messed me up."

532
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And so when you talk about really messing you up,

533
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 when you indulge pornography, see, some of you,

534
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 you're going into your room or your bathroom with your cell phone

535
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 or your computer or laptop, and you are indulging

536
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 in an extramarital affair with someone you've never met,

537
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 a two-dimensional object, and it is messing you up

538
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 more than you ever could realize.

539
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And I know from experience--I'm a porn addict in recovery.

540
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 I ruined my marriage long before I ever even met my wife.

541
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 We spent the last 12 years healing from my choices

542
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 before we got married, before I met her.

543
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And that's what you're doing, and it will turn your heart.

544
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And maybe pornography--maybe you're here, and pornography's not your issue.

545
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Maybe it's just romantic comedies.

546
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 You're sitting there, you watch it, and you wake up the next day

547
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 because you're single.

548
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 How did this happen? When am I going to find someone?

549
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 What's wrong with me? And you don't know why.

550
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Oh, you watch that movie.

551
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 You're feeding your heart discontentment,

552
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 and you don't realize it, but it just turns a little bit,

553
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 if this is your heart, right?

554
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 You just--a little romantic comedy, right?

555
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 A little pornography just gets a little cloudier,

556
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 a little cloudier, a little less trustworthy.

557
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Before I watch a movie, a free resource,

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 you can get it in the App Store, plugged in,

559
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 is a great resource for you to download.

560
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 It will tell you if there's nudity or not.

561
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 It will tell you the sexual content of the movie,

562
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 language, that sort of thing.

563
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Verse 26, "Give careful thought to the paths for your feet,

564
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 "and be steadfast in all your ways.

565
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 "Do not turn to the right or to the left.

566
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 "Keep your foot from evil."

567
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 He said, "Hey, be careful where you go and who you're with."

568
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Okay? We say all the time here,

569
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 you may need to change your playmates in your playground.

570
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 That may be what you need to do.

571
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 If you're asking right now,

572
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 "I wonder if I need to change my playmates in my playground,"

573
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 I can pretty much guarantee you you do.

574
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And so let me walk you through what that looks like,

575
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 because people are like, "JP, are you saying

576
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 "that I should just get rid of all my friends?"

577
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Yes, and they say, "Well, how do I do that?"

578
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And I say, "You delete all their numbers.

579
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 "You send them a text, maybe, courtesy text.

580
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 "We can't hang out anymore.

581
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 "You know, that's how you do it."

582
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And like, that sounds rude. It sounds like survival.

583
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Like some of you are like, "Man, I'm so tired of getting drunk."

584
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Well, cool. Hang out with sober people.

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Okay? That will help a lot.

586
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And you're like, "Dude, you want me to get rid of all my friends?

587
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 "That sounds so lonely."

588
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Look around you.

589
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Like, I don't know where you're at listening to this,

590
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 but my hunch is you're probably surrounded by some Christians.

591
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And you could stick out your hand and say,

592
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 "Hey, nice to meet you.

593
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 "Can you help me?"

594
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 (laughter)

595
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Here in Dallas, we have Open Community Group.

596
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 You're going to walk in these rooms here in a minute.

597
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 It's going to be amazing.

598
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And you're going to be friends.

599
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Okay? We can help you.

600
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 We see people do it all the time. It changes their life.

601
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I know it's hard, but it's not complicated.

602
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 It may feel difficult, but it's not complicated.

603
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 And so it says, "Keep your foot far from evil."

604
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 This is an easy one.

605
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 If something seems evil, stay far from it.

606
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Don't think about it. Don't entertain it.

607
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Get away from it.

608
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And so you're like, "Well, what's evil?"

609
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 See, something good can be evil when it becomes ultimate.

610
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Something that's actually good can become something evil

611
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 when it becomes ultimate to you.

612
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 And so just be careful of what your idols are.

613
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 But I think a lot of times I talk to people,

614
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 and they just don't have a good understanding of what's evil and what's not.

615
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Like this other conversation that I have up here a lot is

616
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 guys will say, "Man, hey, my story is real similar to yours."

617
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 And they'll kind of look away, and I'm like, "I know what that means.

618
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 You're struggling with porn, huh?"

619
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 And they'll say, "Yeah, man, I'm struggling with pornography."

620
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 "How do you access porn?"

621
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 "Oh, bro, my cell phone, iPhone."

622
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 "Okay, all right. Where's your phone?"

623
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 "Here in my pocket."

624
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 "Oh, I got you. I thought you said you were struggling with porn.

625
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 You're carrying it around with you everywhere you go. That's different.

626
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Can we agree that's different?

627
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 See, you made it kind of sound like you were fighting it,

628
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 like you were waging war with it.

629
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 You're not waging war with it.

630
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 You're carrying around a portal to all kinds of nude images

631
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 that you want at any time in your pocket."

632
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 "What do you want me to do, dude?

633
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Do you want me to get rid of my phone?"

634
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 "Yes."

635
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 "You want me to be the only dude on the planet without a phone?"

636
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 "Yes."

637
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 "Man, that sounds legalistic."

638
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 No, turn to Matthew 5 where Jesus says, "Gouge out your eye,

639
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 and we can talk about legalistic."

640
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Where he says, "Cut off your hand,

641
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 and we can talk about legalism."

642
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 I'm just saying, "Get rid of your iPhone. You can get a flip phone."

643
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 You know?

644
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 "Dude, you want me to be the only uncool brother with a flip phone?"

645
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 "Yes, I do."

646
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 "You can have a clean heart. It'll be awesome.

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Flip phone, clean heart, all is well in the world."

648
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 You've got to ask yourself, "What are the things that you're looking at?"

649
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Because it's poison to this thing.

650
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 It's poison to your heart.

651
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 You look at something, and before you realize it, right,

652
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 it just messes it up.

653
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 You just give it a little dose, a little dose over time.

654
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 It turns on you, bro.

655
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And how are you going to follow that?

656
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 How are you going to trust that?

657
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Where is that going to take you?

658
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 And it just gets that way because of what you consume

659
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 and because of what you do faster than you realize.

660
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 When you feed your heart more of what it asks for,

661
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 often you feed it less of what it needs.

662
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And so what I'm telling you is that if you have a work obsession

663
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 or you're struggling with purity or sobriety or insecurities,

664
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 would you just please consider what you're feeding your heart?

665
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 You might be able to identify the problem.

666
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 In summary, don't follow an unguarded heart.

667
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 An unguarded heart will lead you astray.

668
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 And don't follow your heart until you inform your heart.

669
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 It's interesting.

670
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 As I was researching, our friend Vinny,

671
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 he's actually a model.

672
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 He does kind of some obscure shoots.

673
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 If somebody's looking for someone who looks like an alien,

674
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 then that's his occupation.

675
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 And he did this one that was entitled "My Heart is Poison."

676
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 So here's a picture of it.

677
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 That's him behind the Photoshop or whatever that is.

678
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 But the image is called "My Heart is Poison."

679
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 And as I saw that and preparing for this, I thought,

680
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 "You know, he got it right."

681
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Like imagine if his friend said,

682
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 "Vinny, I know you want to do this, but your heart is poisoned.

683
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 "And you need a clean heart.

684
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 "You need to clean your heart before you can trust it,

685
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 "before you follow it."

686
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 And so how do you clean your heart, right?

687
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 There's nothing new under the sun.

688
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 You're not going to grow closer to God

689
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 without doing the things that you know you need to do.

690
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 There's no shortcuts.

691
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 There's no way that you're just not going to wake up tomorrow

692
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 and end when the sun sets so much closer to God

693
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 without prayer and without studying the scriptures,

694
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 without joining a community of believers

695
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 and without diving into a church and serving.

696
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 And so you can imagine, right?

697
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 It's like, I don't know what to do.

698
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 You can start with finding a church

699
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 and getting connected there, right?

700
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 And it will start to clean your heart a little bit, right?

701
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 Just a little bit, it will start to clean your heart.

702
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 That was the wrong one, sorry.

703
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Just a little bit, a little bit,

704
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 it will start to clean your heart.

705
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Not much at all.

706
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 But then you start to study the scriptures,

707
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 start to read the Bible,

708
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 start to understand God's word,

709
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 and a little more, right?

710
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 It's just you're instructing your heart,

711
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 you're showing it where to go,

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 and a little more, it may get just a tiny bit lighter.

713
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 And then as you grow in your relationship with him

714
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 and you incorporate the spiritual disciplines,

715
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 you surround yourself with believers,

716
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 folks who are holding you accountable,

717
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 and you change what you're doing

718
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 and the way that you're spending your time.

719
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 And then before you realize it,

720
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 God's Holy Spirit is purifying that

721
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 which the world sought to ruin.

722
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 And you have a clean heart.

723
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 And you think for a moment, you think,

724
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 but doesn't Jesus clean my heart?

725
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 See, some of you, your problem tonight

726
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 is not that you're not reading the Bible,

727
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 not that you're not praying,

728
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 and not that you're not a member of a church,

729
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 and not that you're not in community.

730
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 And it's not that you love Nicki Minaj,

731
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 and it's not that you're watching 13 Reasons Why,

732
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 and it's not that you cuss and gossip

733
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 and the things you say.

734
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Your problem is you don't have a relationship

735
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 with the creator of the heavens and the earth.

736
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 You have not trusted in his son, Jesus Christ,

737
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 his provision for you on the cross,

738
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 that he died for your abortion,

739
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 that he died for your porn problem,

740
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 that he died for the fact that you worship food

741
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 or you worship yourself

742
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 or you think about yourself too much,

743
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 that he died for your impurity,

744
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 that he died for your sex,

745
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 the things that you've worshiped.

746
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Christ died for them.

747
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And you've heard that,

748
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 and you have been to church before,

749
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 you've read the scripture,

750
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 but you haven't trusted in it.

751
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 And you're going through this life

752
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 with a broken, messed up, degenerate heart.

753
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 And what I want you to know is right now,

754
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 God desires to give you a new one,

755
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 one that can work well,

756
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 one that can consume the scripture,

757
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 one that seeks relationships with other believers,

758
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 one that desires to talk to God.

759
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 If you're struggling with those things,

760
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 you may consider, do I have a new heart?

761
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 And you may go to God and you say,

762
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 God, I have sinned against you

763
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 in the things that I've worshipped,

764
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 in my relationships,

765
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 in the way that I've dated

766
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 or the way that I've wanted to date,

767
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 in the things that I've done,

768
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 in the privacy of my bedroom.

769
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 I've sinned against you

770
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 in what I've drank, snorted, smoked, consumed.

771
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 I've ran from you.

772
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 I've flipped you off and ran the opposite direction.

773
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 I've sinned against you in my self-righteousness,

774
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 in my legalism,

775
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 in my thinking that I'm good enough.

776
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 And God says, Son, Daughter, look at me.

777
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 I love you.

778
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 I know you've done those things.

779
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ.

780
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 He says he delights in forgiving us.

781
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 He says, Paul's letter to the Corinthians,

782
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 I'm no longer counting your sins against you.

783
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Wow.

784
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Would you just trust in my provision of my Son, Jesus?

785
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 I love you. I hate your sin.

786
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Someone has to die, so I did it.

787
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 Don't you get it? I did it for you.

788
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Would you trust in that?

789
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 It'll give you a clean heart.

790
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 You can start anew tonight.

791
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 A new heart.

792
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 A new spirit.

793
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 It'll put inside of you,

794
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 take out your heart of stone

795
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 and give you a heart of flesh.

796
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 It's great news.

797
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Can we just pray for a minute?

798
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 I'm gonna lead you in prayer as we wrap up.

799
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 It's gonna take some focus on your part.

800
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 There's an enemy, he hates you.

801
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 He's gonna try to distract you

802
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 with a lot of thoughts right now,

803
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 and I just want you to stay focused

804
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 and close your eyes.

805
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 I want you to ask God to reveal to you

806
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 idols hidden in your heart.

807
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 The things you're tempted to love

808
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 more than him right now.

809
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 If your mind's already drifted,

810
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 God feels far, you've never done this before,

811
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 you might start by asking him

812
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 to help you trust in the provision

813
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 of his son Jesus Christ

814
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 as a payment for your sins.

815
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Stay focused.

816
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 You're asking God to reveal idols in your heart.

817
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 Search deep, what are they?

818
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Idols.

819
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 Things that you're tempted to love more than him.

820
00:46:49,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 A relationship, material things, a job, money, you.

821
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Ask God to reveal unhealthy habits

822
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 at the campuses.

823
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 You too, ask God to reveal unhealthy habits

824
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 that could be shows that you can't miss,

825
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 Utivo, music.

826
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 It may be things you read or look at

827
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 that lure your heart away from him.

828
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 God, would you please reveal to us

829
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 unhealthy habits, things we watch, listen to,

830
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 things we read, things we look at,

831
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 things we do.

832
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Would you ask God to give you the courage

833
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 to take the steps necessary

834
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 to rid your life of evil?

835
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 As you run an audit,

836
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 you've embraced some things that are simply worldly.

837
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 It may be weird, it may be different.

838
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 You're called to be an alien, a stranger in a foreign land.

839
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 God, would you help us to take the courage

840
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 to take the steps necessary to rid our lives of evil?

841
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 Stay focused if your mind has drifted.

842
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 Fight for it.

843
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 There's an enemy who hates you.

844
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Would you ask God to help you replace those things

845
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 with healthy habits of reading his word,

846
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 praying regularly, talking to him,

847
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 joining a church,

848
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 surrounding yourself with what we call community,

849
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 other believers.

850
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 It's a makeover.

851
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 Make no mistake about it, it is a new life.

852
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 It may be radical.

853
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 That may be what you need to do right now,

854
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 something crazy.

855
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 Ask him for help.

856
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 You wake up tomorrow, start your day in his word.

857
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 End this day by talking to him,

858
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 joining a church, community.

859
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Father in heaven, would you please reveal to us

860
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 the idols hidden in our heart,

861
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 the things that we are tempted to love more than you?

862
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 And God, would you please help us to see

863
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 the unhealthy habits that we have,

864
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 the shows that we watch,

865
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 the music that we listen to,

866
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 the literature that lures our heart away from you, God?

867
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 And would you give us the courage, please,

868
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 to help us to take the steps necessary

869
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 to rid our lives of all things evil?

870
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 The things that we love more than you, God,

871
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 would you remove them?

872
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Terrifying prayer.

873
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 Would you remove them?

874
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 And God, would you help us to replace those things

875
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 with healthy activities,

876
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 the pursuit of you, the love for you,

877
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 of reading your word, knowing your word,

878
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 understanding it, studying it,

879
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 praying, talking to you, God,

880
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 joining a church, being under the authority

881
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 of leaders in a church

882
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 and joining a community of believers.

883
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 Would you take our hearts, Lord?

884
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 Would you speak what is true, Lord?

885
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.
