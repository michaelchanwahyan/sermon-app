1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:25,440
 - Alright, welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,040
 friends of Fort Worth, Houston.

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,180
 Get excited.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,580
 Paso Phoenix, Nashville,

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,240
 Menhill, North Carolina,

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,480
 Southampton, Philadelphia,

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,760
 wherever you are joining us from,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,260
 Fayetteville, and friends here tonight.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,680
 Who's familiar with the term love language?

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,400
 Okay, alright.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,320
 By show of hands, who in this room would say

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,320
 they are an acts of service love language person?

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,640
 Okay, a few.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,040
 What about quality time?

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,760
 There you go.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,520
 Touch?

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,480
 (audience cheering)

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,760
 What about all my gifts, people?

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,980
 Words of affirmation?

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,420
 Okay.

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,600
 If you're not familiar with any of those,

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,280
 basically some guy came out with a book,

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,000
 made a killing convincing the world

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,680
 that everyone has one of these five love languages.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,600
 I don't know if that's biblical,

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
 but it's somewhat helpful.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,080
 And let me tell you about my love language.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,420
 So me and my wife have different love languages.

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,720
 The theory of the book is everyone has

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,680
 at least one love language.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,060
 Sometimes you have a couple of them,

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,320
 but typically people have a predominant one,

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,120
 maybe two predominant ones.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,660
 My love languages would be acts of service

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,960
 and physical touch.

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,640
 Acts of service, physical touch.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,280
 Serve me, touch me.

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
 Serve me again.

40
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,520
 That's all I want, man.

41
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,660
 My wife's love language would be quality time

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,360
 and words of affirmation.

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,040
 So quality time, she doesn't care

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,280
 if I'm out mowing the lawn.

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,960
 She doesn't care if I clean up the house,

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
 do any service.

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,600
 She's great to sit and filth just you and I,

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,640
 just sitting together.

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,480
 This is great.

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,320
 Not quantity time, quality time, the two of us.

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,960
 Or cards, notes, words of affirmation.

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,880
 This is the stuff that makes you feel loved.

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,280
 And I tell all that because there was a time not recently,

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,480
 or that was recent, where it was Mother's Day

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,500
 this past year.

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,320
 I had a plan, got some gifts together,

57
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,280
 decided that I was gonna get my wife this necklace

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,120
 with our kids' names on it.

59
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
 And then I got her a massage.

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,960
 I know, husband of the year.

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,480
 I had gotten her this card,

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
 and I just had the day planned out.

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
 We were gonna go to this brunch and breakfast,

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,160
 and we woke up that morning,

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,420
 and I gave her the kind of gifts that I had given.

66
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,060
 The card, I had had my son, who's three and a half,

67
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,000
 write and fill out.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
 It was kind of like, oh, this will be sweet,

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
 and I'll have him write the card.

70
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,680
 He can't write words, so he just writes with a crown,

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
 like some colors inside of there.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,520
 And I thought that was brilliant and genius,

73
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,280
 and husband of the year, no big deal.

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,720
 And I give her the whole gift package, give it to her,

75
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,320
 and she's like, this is great.

76
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,800
 And the breakfast kind of goes on,

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
 and we're at breakfast having brunch,

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,240
 and then we get home from that breakfast,

79
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,600
 and we're getting ready to put kids down for naps.

80
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,820
 And I look at her, and she's over by the kitchen sink,

81
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,920
 and she's emotional.

82
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,080
 I can tell that she's like, oh, man,

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,800
 she's upset about something right now.

84
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,360
 And I don't know if it's like, oh, man,

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,480
 look, I've just touched you so deeply

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,720
 with my thoughtfulness.

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,240
 And she's like, she says,

88
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,440
 "I feel like you don't know me at all.

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,760
 "You didn't write me a card?"

90
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,480
 And I'm like, and this moment I go,

91
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,880
 well, I had him write in the card.

92
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,200
 That was the sweetest thing ever.

93
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
 And she was like, I know, but that's great,

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
 but you didn't get a card from you to me?

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,180
 And it was a realization that my attempted expressing love

96
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,400
 was now received in the way

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,160
 that I thought it was going to be received.

98
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,520
 Because our definitions of love and love languages

99
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,160
 and what love looks like are different.

100
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
 I've learned from that.

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,820
 And now every single time, no matter what,

102
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,440
 if it's a Wednesday, here's a card

103
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,480
 that I've written for you.

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,800
 And it's not entirely true.

105
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
 It's not at all true, actually,

106
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
 so don't give me credit for that.

107
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,940
 But point being, I will not make that mistake again.

108
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,480
 And I start there because in our marriage,

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,400
 we have different definitions of what love looks like,

110
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,920
 what love is.

111
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,400
 Like I said, for me, it's acts of service

112
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,280
 and physical touch.

113
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,160
 For her, it's gonna be quality time

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
 or hearing things written out and words described to her.

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
 And our definitions are different.

116
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,040
 What does that have to do

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,520
 with what we're talking about tonight?

118
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,160
 Well, we're continuing the series, Instagram theology.

119
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,100
 What's Instagram theology?

120
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,940
 We are looking at some of the more popular

121
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,080
 cultural mantras that people throw out there

122
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,080
 and people say on Instagram or just kind of in life

123
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,520
 that there's a lot of culture behind it,

124
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,200
 but they're half truths at best.

125
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,920
 And tonight, just like my wife and I

126
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,300
 had different definitions of what love looks like

127
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,960
 and what love is, there's an Instagram mantra

128
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,520
 called love is love.

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
 Whereas culture, we basically say like,

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
 hey, look, we may agree to disagree

131
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,400
 and have different definitions of what love looks like,

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,480
 of what love is, of when love is appropriate,

133
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,680
 but let's just agree, like love is a great thing,

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,240
 and so let's kind of keep it at that.

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
 Like our culture has embraced

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,700
 that there are different definitions of love,

137
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,520
 but as long as it's love, that is what matters most.

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,180
 People will use the phrase love is love,

139
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,080
 which is what we're gonna talk about

140
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,260
 for the next 30 minutes or so,

141
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,420
 to encourage different relationships

142
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,540
 that you may have heard of.

143
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,200
 People will, underneath the banner of love,

144
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,360
 it basically, if you haven't heard that term,

145
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
 it basically is kind of like, you know, love is blind,

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,000
 it knows no religion, it knows no sex or gender.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,360
 It is what most important is that there is love there.

148
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,920
 Don't be confined by anything else.

149
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,240
 It's the most powerful force in the universe.

150
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,160
 And so we may disagree on what love is supposed to look like,

151
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,240
 but as long as love is there, that is a beautiful thing.

152
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,140
 And there's something true about that,

153
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,720
 but there's also something really wrong about that.

154
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,520
 And as we've said throughout this series,

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,040
 any time that, you know, culture begins to step

156
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
 in the direction of things that God said,

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,700
 this is something you don't define, I define,

158
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,660
 it comes with tremendous consequences

159
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,120
 when we abandon God's definitions.

160
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
 In other words, when you begin to talk about, like,

161
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
 different definitions of this is what love looks like,

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,260
 or this is love, the Bible says that God, who is love,

163
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,480
 defines it, and he gives a definition

164
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,720
 of what love is to look like.

165
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,400
 So we're gonna look for the next handful of minutes

166
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
 of what is wrong with some of the more popular ideas

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
 as it relates to love is love.

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,120
 People will marry someone of a different faith

169
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,480
 underneath the idea, or in the name of, hey, love is love.

170
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,600
 People will push for marrying someone of the same sex

171
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,040
 underneath the idea that, you know, love is love,

172
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,640
 and, you know, love, how could love ever be a bad thing?

173
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,080
 So we're gonna talk about how could love be a destructive

174
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,400
 and bad thing.

175
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,780
 The truth about love is love,

176
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,100
 or one of the things that's true,

177
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,540
 is love is incredibly powerful.

178
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,140
 Love is incredibly powerful, and you can fall in love

179
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,020
 with someone that God would say is not who he calls you

180
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,180
 to marry.

181
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,020
 You can fall in love with someone regardless of their age,

182
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,620
 regardless of their gender, regardless of their religion,

183
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,260
 that love is an incredibly powerful thing.

184
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,920
 I went to a John Mayer concert last week.

185
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,860
 John Mayer would not be selling out American Airlines Center

186
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,120
 if love did not exist, or particularly if women

187
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,520
 did not exist, because I'm sitting there literally

188
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,900
 in the room, and I know I'm gonna get pushback

189
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,540
 from the guys who are like, I love John.

190
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,240
 If women didn't exist, John would not be selling out

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,080
 American Airlines Center.

192
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,480
 He would be working at Guitar Center.

193
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,700
 He's clearly a very talented guy, but there's not guys

194
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,480
 who are like, yeah, I'm gonna pay $200 to sit there

195
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,920
 and play Gravity, please, I love that one.

196
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,360
 And love is a powerful thing.

197
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,840
 It leads people to make decisions, spend money,

198
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,800
 spend their time, their attention, their focus.

199
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
 I mean, it moves us.

200
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,560
 Love is incredibly powerful, but love in a direction

201
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,480
 that God says is not the direction of what love truly

202
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,960
 is supposed to look like can be an incredibly powerful thing

203
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,020
 that is also incredibly dangerous.

204
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,220
 So we're gonna look for the next handful of minutes

205
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,060
 at three ideas.

206
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,560
 What is wrong with love is love?

207
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
 And I'm gonna answer that.

208
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,120
 Why God, who's there, would have anything to say,

209
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,120
 or may not always be crazy about all forms of, quote, love,

210
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,400
 and then what does it look like to have love in your life

211
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,680
 that looks like the love of God or God's love?

212
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
 What does that look like?

213
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,440
 So the first one, what could possibly be wrong

214
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,280
 with love is love?

215
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,440
 Here's the first idea.

216
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,620
 When love is love, love becomes a God.

217
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,440
 Like when love is love, and using that phrase,

218
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,260
 whenever it's like, hey, you know what, love is love,

219
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,480
 as a justification that, hey, you can't really explain it,

220
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,760
 and you know I was caught up in the moment,

221
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
 and it's a sweeping force, and you can't control

222
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,320
 who you're in love with, and we just fell into love together

223
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,640
 and it's used for a Christian, and I'm talking

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,520
 just to Christians primarily in this message.

225
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,440
 When it becomes something that a Christian uses

226
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,880
 to justify living or relationships

227
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,840
 that contradict God's word, you are no longer underneath

228
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,840
 the control of the Holy Spirit, control of yourself.

229
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,600
 You're basically saying like, hey, I couldn't help it.

230
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,720
 I was swept up in love, and love is no longer some,

231
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,100
 you know, thing that is just a part

232
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,320
 of a romantic relationship.

233
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,720
 Love becomes your God.

234
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,480
 Love becomes the thing that controls you.

235
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,920
 You're helpless, you're at its will, you're at its mercy.

236
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
 And anytime that a Christian justifies relationships

237
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
 that contradict God's word, whether it would be

238
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,760
 with someone of an opposite faith,

239
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,260
 or someone, not an opposite faith, of a different faith,

240
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,860
 or someone of the same sex, it communicates that,

241
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,140
 hey, love is God.

242
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,680
 At the end of the day, I'm not responsible

243
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,220
 for who I fall in love with, and love would lead me

244
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,040
 to do this, and that, the tragic thing,

245
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,320
 is that it begins to make love become God.

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,160
 What do I mean?

247
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,360
 Because God is love, and we'll talk about that in a second,

248
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,720
 but I mean, by love becoming your God,

249
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,860
 it's like, it presents the idea as though,

250
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,520
 man, I had to, or I have to,

251
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,120
 because the heart wants what it wants.

252
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,100
 And I was moved by the love God, if you will.

253
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,320
 And when that happens, it can be

254
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,580
 an incredibly dangerous thing.

255
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,040
 It's happening all over our culture right now,

256
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,240
 where people under the banner of love is love

257
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,680
 are buying that lie, and it's making love a God.

258
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,280
 What do I mean?

259
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,560
 I don't know if you guys remember Woody Allen.

260
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,880
 Woody Allen is a very famous movie director.

261
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,400
 Woody Allen had, you know, Midnight in Paris

262
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,880
 has been tons of films, very successful movie director.

263
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,640
 He married someone named Mia Farrow back in the 1980s,

264
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,040
 and Mia was just another kind of celebrity person

265
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,560
 on the scene, and they had a family together.

266
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,200
 Here's the family of them together.

267
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,280
 If you know Woody Allen, that's Mia in the middle.

268
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,120
 Here's some of their kids.

269
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,840
 I think this is like their second or third marriage,

270
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,400
 but that baby boy is actually the two of them.

271
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
 And this is her adopted daughter,

272
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,440
 and her kids over here, and they married.

273
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,800
 Five years after they had their little baby boy,

274
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,960
 he began a relationship, Woody Allen,

275
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,600
 with the girl that's on the right there.

276
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,880
 And he began to have a sexual relationship,

277
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,760
 and today he's married to the woman

278
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,460
 who was formerly his stepdaughter.

279
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,600
 And you know what he said whenever he was interviewed,

280
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,840
 'cause people, as you would imagine,

281
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,640
 like, "Oh, awkward, that's a little creepy."

282
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,880
 He did an interview with Time Magazine,

283
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,340
 and at the end of the interview, he basically was like,

284
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,560
 "Look, it's not that big of a deal."

285
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,580
 And here was the famous line, you probably heard it,

286
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,440
 'cause it's been picked up by others.

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,940
 "The heart wants what it wants.

288
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,460
 "There's no logic to those things.

289
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,760
 "You meet someone, and you fall in love, and that's that."

290
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,140
 He's basically saying, "Hey, love is love,

291
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,100
 "and in his scenario, love is his God.

292
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,080
 "I can't be responsible for who I fall in love with."

293
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,820
 Other scenarios that are even more extreme,

294
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,360
 because that one, there may be some part of you

295
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,700
 that's like, "Oh, you know, it wasn't his biological,

296
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,880
 "is that that big of a deal?"

297
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,980
 But we would all have a line where we would say,

298
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,820
 "Hey, love is love, it's not okay

299
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,840
 "if love leads you to do this."

300
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,160
 Underneath that definition, I think most of us

301
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,360
 would have some line where we draw,

302
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,080
 where we're like, "No, love is not love there,

303
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,360
 "that's creepy," or illegal.

304
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,620
 An example that I mean by that is,

305
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,800
 you guys heard of NAMBLA?

306
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,020
 There's an association called NAMBLA,

307
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,180
 which stands for National Association of Man-Boy Love.

308
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,240
 It's a group that basically says they were born

309
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,580
 with urges to love children,

310
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,580
 and they push for and try to legislate

311
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,500
 to get Congress to remove the requirements,

312
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,680
 you have to be of a certain age in order to have love.

313
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,460
 In other words, if it's consensual with a young child,

314
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,720
 if there's boys out there that want to engage in that,

315
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,900
 then we should be able to do that.

316
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,840
 And my point in bringing that up

317
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,040
 is not because I think that's a tremendously common thing

318
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,900
 in the room, but it's at least a point where we'd all go,

319
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,200
 "Hey, love is love in that scenario is not okay.

320
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
 "I don't care who's consenting,

321
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,240
 "that's over the line, that's not okay.

322
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,160
 "If you make love your God

323
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,720
 "and that's where your God leaves, not okay."

324
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,300
 But as a society, this increasingly

325
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,780
 is something that we see, and it's become almost comical.

326
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,520
 I don't know if you saw this dude in Argentina

327
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,760
 who recently decided he was gonna marry a tree

328
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,000
 underneath the banner of love is love.

329
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,160
 That happened.

330
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,700
 I'm not even sure what to even address at that point.

331
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,600
 A woman recently, I think it was a couple weeks ago,

332
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,300
 who decided in the UK to marry her dog

333
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,600
 after four broken engagements.

334
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,680
 This is her, they actually went through with it.

335
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,940
 And all of those, I mean, they're just like,

336
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,640
 "Dude, that's nuts, that's so extreme.

337
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,800
 "The line is so far out there, but this is a result."

338
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
 Or is a line of thinking that is consistent

339
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,100
 with the idea that, "Man, hey, love is love.

340
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,540
 "I'm not responsible, and love's gonna lead me where it may."

341
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,240
 And it reflects the idea that love is God.

342
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,900
 Now, here's where it becomes relevant to the room.

343
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,100
 All of us do this at some level,

344
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,560
 or many of us still do this.

345
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,060
 Like, you don't put the line at dog or at tree

346
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,220
 as being kind of the line that, you know,

347
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,300
 you can't go farther than that.

348
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,520
 But any time that we put the line where God doesn't put it,

349
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,220
 we're putting it, and we're saying, "Man, love is love,

350
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,340
 "and because we love each other, it's okay."

351
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,240
 If you're dating someone who's not a believer in Jesus,

352
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,100
 they're of a different faith,

353
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,460
 you are moving the line just like somebody saying,

354
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,280
 "You know what, it's okay as long as I move the line

355
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,020
 "over to a dog," because it doesn't align with God's word.

356
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,020
 If you're doing it and you're like,

357
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,420
 "Man, he just calls himself a Christian,"

358
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,280
 and you're dating someone, and under the name

359
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,780
 of love is love, and we love each other,

360
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,260
 and I'm working with him, and maybe he's gonna

361
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,060
 get it together, you're doing the same thing.

362
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,700
 You're moving the line where God doesn't say

363
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,660
 you should move it.

364
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,240
 If you're dating someone and you're introducing sex

365
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,900
 into the relationship, or you're living together,

366
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,660
 and you're like, "It's okay, we're married in God's eyes.

367
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,500
 "You know, love is love," you're doing the same thing

368
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,900
 where you're taking your filter and using love

369
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,240
 and blaming on love the actions that you have.

370
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,140
 You're basically going, "Love is my God.

371
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,060
 "I have to do this," even if God says not to.

372
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,580
 Jesus said the line is not where you put it,

373
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,900
 where they put it, but he clearly articulates

374
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,180
 here's the type of love that God loves to see

375
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,420
 and the context for human love to take place

376
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,340
 in a romantic way.

377
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,700
 He says this in Matthew chapter 19.

378
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,780
 When God was on the planet, he stood up

379
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,980
 and he was asked about marriage,

380
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,540
 and here's what he said marriage is.

381
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,040
 Matthew 19, verse five and six.

382
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,460
 For this reason, a man will leave his father and his mother

383
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,900
 and be united to his wife, and the two

384
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,180
 will become one flesh.

385
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,780
 So they are no longer two, but one.

386
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,620
 Therefore, what God has joined together,

387
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,620
 let no one separate.

388
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,520
 Jesus' definition of the context for which love

389
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,340
 should take place, the type of love that God loves,

390
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,380
 is between one man and one woman

391
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,100
 in the context of marriage for life.

392
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,160
 The apostle Paul would go on to add

393
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,780
 that it would be one man, one woman

394
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,760
 who are both believers following Jesus.

395
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,760
 The direction of their life is following Jesus.

396
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,120
 One man, one woman for life.

397
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,820
 That's really what God says is to be the love

398
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,920
 that marks his people.

399
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,540
 Why would God not love all forms of love?

400
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,460
 Like what's the big deal to have love

401
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,180
 outside of a relationship between one man

402
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,580
 and one woman in marriage for life?

403
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,440
 Like what is the big deal?

404
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,340
 How could anyone be opposed to like these beautiful

405
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,220
 same-sex couples who are together,

406
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,020
 or couples even if they're of different faiths,

407
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,160
 they've learned to work it out

408
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,980
 and it's kind of a beautiful thing together.

409
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,980
 How could God be opposed to that?

410
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
 It's so beautiful.

411
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,020
 The reason is is because God loves you

412
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,320
 more than he loves love.

413
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,100
 The reason is that God loves you more than he loves

414
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,760
 any earthly definition of love.

415
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,180
 And he loves you so much that anything

416
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,200
 that's gonna hurt you, or anything that's gonna hurt me,

417
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,100
 or anything that hurts people,

418
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
 by definition he cannot love.

419
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,060
 And so as it relates to relationships

420
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,060
 that contradict God's design

421
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,740
 and how he created marriage and love to take place,

422
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,980
 of course he's not going to.

423
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,240
 Because he knows that hey, if you reject God's design,

424
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,740
 it comes with consequences inside of your life.

425
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,140
 The two most common ways,

426
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,780
 or two most common types really of love

427
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,100
 that are relevant and applicable to this room,

428
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,380
 that God doesn't love because he loves you,

429
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,020
 is relationships, dating relationships,

430
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,500
 and married relationships between a believing Christian

431
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,180
 and a non-believer.

432
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,980
 A believing Christian and someone who's Hindu,

433
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,780
 a believing Christian and someone who's Muslim,

434
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,820
 a believing Christian and someone who's Jewish,

435
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,020
 or not, or atheist.

436
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,540
 Between a believing Christian and someone who is not

437
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,100
 is a relationship that the Bible teaches

438
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,340
 you are to get out now if you're in.

439
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,060
 In 2 Corinthians chapter six, verse 14,

440
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,180
 the apostle Paul writes exactly about this.

441
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,500
 And speaking to marriage here,

442
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,860
 do not be yoked together, which is an agricultural term

443
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,760
 for basically oxen would be yoked together,

444
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,620
 they'd put two by one another and they'd throw a yoke on,

445
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,820
 and you are unequally yoked if the oxen moved

446
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,860
 in different directions or not in the same direction.

447
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,340
 And Paul says hey, just like that,

448
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,500
 when it comes to your life,

449
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,100
 you should be connected and partnered in marriage

450
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,880
 with people who are moving in the same direction.

451
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,380
 With unbelievers, don't do it.

452
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,340
 For what does righteousness and wickedness have in common?

453
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,740
 Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?

454
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,120
 The Bible teaches that you are to be in relationship,

455
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,500
 not with someone who claims to be a Christian

456
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,600
 or even uses that title, but someone who's following Jesus.

457
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,980
 Why would it be a bad idea?

458
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,220
 Like why is God not cool with that?

459
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,140
 Like maybe you as their friend or you're dating them,

460
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,700
 you could be a part of bringing them to God,

461
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,460
 why would he not be on board with that?

462
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,380
 A couple reasons.

463
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,700
 Because it hurts you.

464
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,100
 It hurts your faith.

465
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,700
 If you marry someone who's not of your same

466
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,380
 religious background or doesn't have your faith in Christ,

467
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,700
 here's what you're guaranteeing yourself.

468
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,980
 One of two options.

469
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,720
 You will either cap your relationship with Christ

470
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,820
 or cap your relationship with that person.

471
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,800
 You're either gonna cap your relationship,

472
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,080
 but in other words, like if you marry someone

473
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,960
 and they're not a Christian,

474
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,800
 you're either gonna be like,

475
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,360
 hey, you know, we don't have to go to church.

476
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,520
 It's not that big of a deal to me.

477
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,800
 It's not really that important.

478
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,960
 I care about you and so let's do whatever you wanna do.

479
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,800
 And you're gonna cap your relationship with Jesus,

480
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,320
 the person you say is most important in my life,

481
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,520
 which is what a follower of Christ does.

482
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
 Or you're gonna cap your relationship with that person

483
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,600
 'cause you're gonna go all in

484
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,000
 and you're still trying to follow Jesus

485
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,140
 and they won't necessarily always be on board with that.

486
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,380
 And so you're spending your time different,

487
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,460
 your values are different.

488
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,860
 You're either gonna cap your intimacy

489
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,780
 with your spouse or with Jesus,

490
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,500
 which inevitably is gonna hurt you

491
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,340
 and hurt your faith and your marriage.

492
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,700
 Second ways that it hurts you

493
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,180
 is marrying someone who is of a different faith.

494
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,580
 And if you're not here, all of us may have siblings

495
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,740
 or friends and people in our lives

496
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,060
 that are entering into relationships

497
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,100
 with someone who's not a follower of Christ.

498
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,740
 45% of marriages in the last 10 years

499
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,160
 were between people of two faiths in America,

500
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,480
 two different faiths, 45%, almost one and two.

501
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,840
 In doing so, studies show you triple your

502
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,380
 chances of getting a divorce.

503
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,520
 In other words, whatever it is right now,

504
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,920
 and it's already pretty high,

505
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,680
 you are tripling the likelihood

506
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
 that you're gonna get a divorce.

507
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,300
 Upwards of 75% of non-same faith relationships,

508
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,020
 marriages, end in divorce.

509
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,500
 You're almost guaranteeing that the children

510
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,540
 that you raise are gonna walk away from the church.

511
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,980
 When there's one believing spouse

512
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,780
 or one practicing faithful person,

513
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,420
 studies have shown that there is a 2% chance,

514
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,340
 a 2% chance that your children are gonna walk up

515
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,780
 and be practicing believers in that faith of the mother

516
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,460
 if she's a practicing believer and the father's not.

517
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,520
 2% chance, you are statistically guaranteeing

518
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,360
 98% chance your children will not,

519
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,960
 if they grow up in that home, have a faith in Jesus.

520
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,920
 And finally, you're hurting the person you're dating.

521
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,620
 You're showing them a weakened expression of Christianity,

522
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,540
 like hey, it's important,

523
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,640
 but it's not as important with you as you.

524
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,360
 And you're showing them some weakened version

525
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,800
 that's like yeah, I mean, it's not that big of a deal.

526
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,940
 I can kind of live however I want,

527
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,760
 and you should try it out sometime.

528
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,280
 Let me be emphatically clear.

529
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,320
 If you are dating someone who is not a Christian,

530
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,420
 and if you date a non-believer,

531
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,260
 you are in direct rebellion to God.

532
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,540
 And if you say, but I love him, clearly,

533
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,700
 and you love him more than you love God,

534
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,460
 because God's word has made it clear.

535
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,340
 I don't care how you met, how much chemistry you have,

536
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,060
 how much electricity, when you touch each other,

537
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,400
 and you like all the same jokes,

538
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,340
 and we love watching movies.

539
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,580
 If they don't share your faith,

540
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,860
 you need to hit the ejection button now.

541
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,960
 And the God who's there is not angry,

542
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,480
 and he's not trying to just move you

543
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,400
 out of having relationships.

544
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,140
 He's trying to move you away from the direction

545
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,840
 of pain and hurt and a future that's in store.

546
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,200
 The second type of relationship that I think

547
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,920
 often we wonder, like how could God be against that,

548
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,020
 is the same-sex relationships.

549
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,040
 I mean, when we go in life, and we bump into friends,

550
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,600
 and all of us have friends, and we know people

551
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,520
 who are siblings or family members or roommates,

552
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,240
 and we come to church on Tuesday, and they're like,

553
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,620
 hey, God is not for same-sex relationships,

554
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,880
 it's only heterosexual, and then you go,

555
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
 and you're around these people, and they're like,

556
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
 man, I just, from as long as I can remember,

557
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,580
 I've only been attracted to women, and I'm a woman,

558
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,600
 or I've only been attracted to men, and I'm a man.

559
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,480
 How could God want something different for them?

560
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,880
 Why would God want something different for them?

561
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,440
 And what I'm about to share, I wanna share just

562
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,160
 to paint a little bit of a picture to align why

563
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,160
 the heart of God, which is always for people

564
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,880
 and always loves people, why would he not love a love?

565
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,200
 And the answer would be because it is hurtful

566
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,200
 to that person, and ultimately unloving in the long term,

567
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,960
 and I know it doesn't always feel that way.

568
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,520
 And so what do I mean by that?

569
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,400
 The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 6, 1 Timothy 1,

570
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,640
 Romans chapter one, and in other places,

571
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,860
 that same-sex relationships are not God's design,

572
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,480
 and the reason he's not for them is because it is

573
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
 a rejection of God's design.

574
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
 He designed one man, one woman, to come together

575
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,160
 in a specific way, and in the context of marriage.

576
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,900
 And any time that you and I reject the creator's design,

577
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,240
 there's consequences that follow.

578
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,740
 Anytime that I don't follow the instructions

579
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,480
 of the creator, there's a great chance the consequences

580
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,660
 are gonna come as a byproduct of that.

581
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,320
 I mean, we see this in life all the time.

582
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,180
 I mean, I, because I'm an acts of service person,

583
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,540
 will do the laundry in our house, I'll go up to my closet,

584
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,340
 share with my wife, get the dirty clothes all together,

585
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,860
 the clothes that are on the floor, stuff 'em

586
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,060
 in the laundry hamper, bring 'em downstairs,

587
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,420
 throw 'em in the washing machine, husband of the year again,

588
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
 doing all the laundry.

589
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,020
 The number of times this next thing has happened

590
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
 is astounding to me.

591
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,380
 We need to get this fixed.

592
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,700
 My wife will go into the laundry room,

593
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,040
 she'll begin to pull some of the clothes out

594
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,140
 that I've washed, and she'll go,

595
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,460
 "Did you wash this dress?

596
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,980
 "It's cashmere, are you serious?"

597
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,200
 And I'm like, "Why was it on the floor then, lady?

598
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,860
 "Give me a break."

599
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,220
 Hopefully I don't say that, but point being,

600
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,600
 I failed, she's like, "Didn't you read the instructions?

601
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,420
 "Whoever reads the instructions on clothes?"

602
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,380
 I'm not going to like read each one,

603
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,180
 okay, this one's good, okay, this one's good.

604
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,000
 Oh, put this one over here, okay.

605
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,540
 Who reads the instructions?

606
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,200
 I don't, wise people, she said.

607
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,620
 (laughing)

608
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,500
 People who would save so much money

609
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,700
 on ruining their wife's dresses,

610
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,060
 and it's like, we're just going to have to put this

611
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,380
 on a doll or something, 'cause it doesn't fit.

612
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,360
 But in failing to read the instructions,

613
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,780
 or to follow the instructions of the designer,

614
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,480
 it creates consequences.

615
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,360
 And in the same way, that's really the picture

616
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,040
 the Bible paints, is really, God created the world,

617
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,800
 he created you, he created life to be found in a certain way

618
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,200
 and when we reject the creator's design,

619
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,160
 there's consequences that come with it.

620
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,080
 And if the Bible is true, and if God is who he says he is,

621
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,280
 and if he created a design as it relates to sexuality

622
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,380
 and relationships in a specific way,

623
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,140
 anytime we reject his design there,

624
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,420
 it comes with consequences.

625
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,020
 What do I mean by consequences?

626
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,900
 Living in a same-sex relationship and lifestyle

627
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,920
 has impacts mental health-wise,

628
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,240
 in terms of life expectancy, and in terms of disease.

629
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,820
 The homosexual lifestyle has been associated

630
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,780
 with a 50% more likelihood of suffering

631
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,360
 from depression and substance abuse.

632
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,580
 200% more likely to commit suicide,

633
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,060
 according to a medical journal of BMC Psychiatry,

634
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,980
 the first was from a recent study in the UK

635
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,320
 from health24.com.

636
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,860
 A lot of people say 200% more times to commit suicide,

637
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,100
 that's just 'cause society is not accepting and is too mean.

638
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,220
 That would make sense,

639
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,660
 except for in the most tolerant,

640
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,180
 embracing societies and countries,

641
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,660
 the statistic is even higher.

642
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,540
 In European nations, where countries

643
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,920
 have hardly any religious practice present,

644
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,580
 and homosexual marriage is both encouraged and celebrated,

645
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,740
 there is a significant increase in suicide.

646
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,860
 Sweden, for one example,

647
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,440
 Sweden legalized same-sex relationships in 1944.

648
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,780
 The United States did in 2015.

649
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,700
 They made speaking against sexual orientation

650
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,220
 a crime as hate speech in 2003.

651
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,560
 It was recognized by the International Lesbian Gay Association

652
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,300
 to be the most gay-friendly country in Europe or the world.

653
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,820
 There, it's not a 200% increase in risk of suicide,

654
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,040
 it is a 300% increased risk of suicide.

655
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,460
 The decrease in life expectancy,

656
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,820
 the Eastern Psychological Association found

657
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,040
 that on average, regardless of the country,

658
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,800
 or regardless of the European and Western countries,

659
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,560
 the decrease in life expectancy is 20 plus years,

660
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,420
 both in gay relationships and lesbian relationships.

661
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,560
 The increased likelihood of disease,

662
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,440
 the United States Center for Disease Control in 2013

663
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,720
 found that while only 3% of the population

664
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,320
 identifies as homosexual,

665
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,440
 it's responsible for 50% of the cases of syphilis,

666
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
 60% of gonorrhea, 75% of all HIV cases

667
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,260
 in the past five years in America.

668
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,380
 Why is disease so rampant?

669
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,720
 Monogamy is an extreme minority.

670
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,960
 Studies have shown, and there was a study done

671
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,400
 in the Journal of Sex Research

672
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,800
 by a gay male couple, David and Andrew Madison,

673
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 they did a study with 2,500 couples,

674
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,720
 and they studied for years these relationships.

675
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,840
 They found that not a single one of them in their study

676
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,220
 was able to maintain a monogamous relationship.

677
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,360
 On the average number of partners,

678
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,880
 they found the modal range for partners

679
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,860
 throughout their lifetime was between 100 and 500.

680
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,080
 And those relationships, it was not,

681
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,120
 in other words, 100 to 500 people they were sleeping with.

682
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,420
 That is not about love, that is about sex.

683
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,920
 And the God who's there,

684
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,640
 and I know a lot of these things,

685
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,160
 again, it's deeply personal, like we know people.

686
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,960
 And when you stand back and you go,

687
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,880
 like, look, hey, love is love, and who am I to say,

688
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,960
 and it's not really my place, and do whatever you want.

689
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,360
 And in fact, you need to embrace how I live

690
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,640
 and encourage it and celebrate it and champion it

691
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,800
 and be like, oh, I'm all on board about it.

692
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,040
 And as Christians, as we're gonna get to in a second,

693
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,200
 our first priority is not someone's sexuality, it's Jesus.

694
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,100
 But at the same time, we can't encourage and applaud

695
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,980
 something that contradicts God's word

696
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,280
 and leads to tremendous consequences in this life.

697
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,120
 I mean, think about it this way.

698
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
 If I told you, or if a friend came to you and said,

699
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,200
 hey, I'm gonna move to a city, and in that city,

700
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,840
 I'm making this decision, I'm gonna move here.

701
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,440
 And you knew that if they moved to that city,

702
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,320
 they had a higher likelihood of being depressed,

703
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,400
 significantly more likely to have suicidal,

704
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,200
 or be suicidal, more likely to have anxiety, to use drugs,

705
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,920
 a higher likelihood to end up with disease,

706
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,840
 and virtually, statistically guarantee

707
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,040
 you're gonna take 20 years off of your life.

708
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,400
 Would it be loving to sit there and go,

709
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,080
 man, who am I to say, you should go do that?

710
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,920
 That's awesome.

711
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,920
 And this is where it's hard sometimes being a Christian,

712
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,880
 'cause you're like, man, I wanna make sure you know Jesus.

713
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,960
 That's what Jesus wants, first and foremost.

714
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,600
 But I can't.

715
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,680
 If you're asking me to just sit back and celebrate it,

716
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,640
 that puts me in a really hard spot.

717
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,000
 That puts me being a friend, knowing that you're gonna move

718
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,120
 into a lifestyle that has significant consequences.

719
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,540
 Rejects God's word, takes 20 years off of your life,

720
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
 and I'm supposed to sit there because I feel bad

721
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,900
 telling you that's not great, and be like,

722
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,660
 yeah, man, love is love, this is awesome, love that.

723
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,340
 And it's tragic.

724
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:24,340
 God's not angry, he loves people,

725
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,700
 regardless of orientation.

726
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,000
 The Bible doesn't even talk about orientation.

727
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,180
 Let me articulate this, too.

728
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,040
 There's a sharp difference between homosexual attraction

729
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,480
 and homosexual action.

730
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,120
 Homosexual attraction is, some studies say one in five,

731
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,760
 it's all over the room.

732
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,680
 But there's a difference, the Bible says,

733
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,360
 between being tempted towards thoughts of the same sex

734
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,440
 and engaging in homosexual behavior,

735
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,360
 and further, engaging in that behavior and say,

736
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,400
 everyone better support me doing this,

737
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
 and if not, they're a bigot.

738
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,180
 As a Christian, you go, man, I love people,

739
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,620
 and I don't wanna see them make decisions

740
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,220
 that are gonna hurt them.

741
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,780
 And so if I have to just speak truth,

742
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,140
 and when I can, I wanna do it humbly,

743
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,260
 and just say, I don't know that this,

744
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,660
 if you're claiming to be a Christian,

745
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,820
 I do know this is not what God has for you.

746
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:25,140
 But God loves people, and so anything that hurts people

747
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,180
 is a love that he doesn't love.

748
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,180
 Finally, how do we as the church love like God loves?

749
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,560
 And I'm gonna land here.

750
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,940
 If love is love, it's wrong, because it makes like,

751
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,680
 whatever I feel I have to do, love is your God.

752
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,920
 Why would God not love every type of love?

753
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,060
 Because any love that hurts people, God can't love.

754
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,620
 'Cause the Bible says in 1 John chapter four,

755
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,220
 that by nature, he is love.

756
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,760
 And so how, I've written in four Cs,

757
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,300
 how do we as Christians love like God loves?

758
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,380
 How do we love like God loves?

759
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,540
 First, is that when it comes to society, humanity,

760
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,400
 we communicate Christ first.

761
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,780
 The biggest list on God's agenda for everyone out there,

762
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,700
 whether they're messed up heterosexually,

763
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,500
 homosexually, polysexually,

764
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,780
 whatever their brokenness sexually is,

765
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,380
 and we all are broken sexually,

766
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,260
 the biggest agenda for every person on the planet,

767
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,020
 regardless of what they look like, where they live,

768
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,020
 how oriented they are sexually, is them knowing Jesus.

769
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,940
 And as a church, we do not focus on behavior,

770
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,100
 and you should stop this right here,

771
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,020
 and let me just tell you, you need to quit that right now,

772
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,980
 to non-Christians.

773
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,180
 We have no business telling non-Christians

774
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,380
 to change their behavior.

775
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,020
 It gives them the impression that God,

776
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,900
 if he's gonna accept them,

777
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,340
 they have to change how they behave.

778
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,000
 We point them to Jesus.

779
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,220
 Christians who point to culture

780
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
 and people who are not believers in Christ

781
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,860
 and say, "Stop acting that way."

782
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,420
 It's like, dude, stay in your lane, bro.

783
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,780
 Stay in your lane.

784
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,680
 We talk to Christians.

785
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,100
 We share the gospel with non-believers.

786
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,180
 We share God's word with believers.

787
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,340
 We call one another to living by God's word.

788
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,540
 But when it comes to what we share,

789
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,340
 we don't focus on behavior with society.

790
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,420
 It's confusing.

791
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,940
 And it's not what the Bible says we are to focus on.

792
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,840
 We share the message of Christ.

793
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,300
 And then the Holy Spirit brings behavioral change.

794
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,560
 But you didn't change before you became a Christian.

795
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,020
 You believe.

796
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,900
 And we focus on people believing or trusting in Jesus,

797
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
 not behaving.

798
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,660
 It's like this.

799
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,040
 In my house, we have rules.

800
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,880
 I have a three-year-old son.

801
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,720
 I think we have a picture of him.

802
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,780
 This is Kru.

803
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,780
 And my son is, there he is.

804
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,900
 He's three and a half.

805
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,300
 He would make sure, like, I'm not three, three and a half.

806
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,620
 And we have different rules.

807
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,980
 What are some of the rules in the house?

808
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,220
 If you're gonna live here, son,

809
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,180
 you gotta follow these rules.

810
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,100
 Here's some of the rules.

811
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,720
 When someone gives you something, you say thank you.

812
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,740
 When you ask for something, you say please.

813
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
 You are courteous.

814
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,660
 You don't hit your sister.

815
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,580
 That's a big one.

816
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,740
 You make sure that you don't spit out your food.

817
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,580
 You listen.

818
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,420
 You don't yell.

819
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,660
 You're kind to people.

820
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,060
 These are some of the rules in our house.

821
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,640
 Some behaviors that as a part of this family,

822
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
 you are to have.

823
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,380
 A couple weeks ago, or I guess 10 days ago,

824
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,220
 we went to Atlanta.

825
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,560
 We were at a family deal in Atlanta,

826
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,180
 and we went to the aquarium in Atlanta.

827
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,260
 I don't know if you've been to the aquarium in Atlanta.

828
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,620
 It's a big deal, apparently.

829
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,180
 Number one aquarium in America, in case you're interested.

830
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
 Anyways, we're in town.

831
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,480
 You do what you do in Atlanta.

832
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,580
 You go to the aquarium.

833
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,420
 Go to the aquarium.

834
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,380
 We get there, got our kids there, my wife, two kids.

835
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,900
 And it is like a nut house.

836
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,220
 It was the most packed environment

837
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,160
 we'd ever been in with children to date.

838
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,540
 I mean, it was just like shoulder to shoulder.

839
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,220
 People love these fish in Atlanta.

840
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,060
 And so we're going in,

841
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,740
 we're seeing all the different things.

842
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,660
 And at one point, there's people everywhere.

843
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,220
 My son darts off.

844
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,140
 And we lost him.

845
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,180
 It's not funny.

846
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,020
 I don't know why I'm laughing.

847
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,860
 (audience laughing)

848
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,020
 It was like, honestly, it was panic mode.

849
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,940
 And it's like, oh my gosh, where did he go?

850
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,780
 I can't see him.

851
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,020
 I'm like, he's three years old.

852
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,980
 He can't move that fast.

853
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,060
 Where could he possibly be gone?

854
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,900
 Where'd you see him go?

855
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,340
 What kind of mother are you?

856
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,300
 Are you serious?

857
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,140
 Where did he go?

858
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,100
 And we're looking everywhere and I can't find him.

859
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,460
 I'm retracing steps and I'm going back

860
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,500
 to like where he could have been.

861
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,260
 And I look over and I'm just like panicked.

862
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,100
 It felt like an hour.

863
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,900
 It was probably like 25 seconds, but it felt like forever.

864
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,780
 And we're looking everywhere for our son.

865
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,060
 And then I look over in the distance

866
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,540
 and he's holding the hand of an aquarium worker

867
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,740
 who's bent over and he's just like bawling his eyes out

868
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,340
 'cause he's like, he can't find his parents

869
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,760
 and she's trying to help him find his parents.

870
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,480
 And I go over and I grab him.

871
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,220
 You know what didn't go through my head

872
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,500
 while we were separated from him?

873
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,740
 While I was like, man, this person that I love,

874
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
 I can't find him.

875
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,380
 I didn't begin to go, you know what, wherever he is,

876
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,980
 I just hope that he's behaving himself.

877
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
 I hope that he's saying please and thank you.

878
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,500
 Better not be hitting anybody.

879
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,740
 Better be very thankful when people give stuff.

880
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,020
 He better keep things in line and represent the family.

881
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,620
 No, I thought, where's my son?

882
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,880
 I care about my son.

883
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,300
 I'm separated from someone I love.

884
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,900
 I'm not going through like, oh, these behavioral things

885
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,740
 he better be doing.

886
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,100
 I'm going through, man, there's someone that I love

887
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,260
 that I'm disconnected with,

888
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,060
 that I wanna be restored back to.

889
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,420
 I can't find him.

890
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,860
 I'm separated from him.

891
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,260
 That's what the Bible says.

892
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,820
 God is a heavenly father.

893
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,540
 And when his children are separated from him,

894
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,360
 the concern of your heavenly father,

895
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,980
 as crazy as it would be for me as a dad to be like,

896
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,380
 yeah, this is great, but son, I wanna hear exactly

897
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,260
 what you were doing while you were separated

898
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,100
 and how you were behaving.

899
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,140
 That's nuts.

900
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,900
 But that's what so many people,

901
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,620
 because the church has not stayed in its lane,

902
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,020
 think about when they think about God.

903
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,740
 They're separated from the heavenly father.

904
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,500
 And they think the heavenly father who's there is like,

905
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,460
 you know what?

906
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,260
 I don't know where they are, but I'm separated.

907
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,020
 They better stop doing that and stop doing that

908
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,340
 and stop doing that.

909
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,380
 It's nuts.

910
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,540
 And the God in Luke chapter 15 that is there

911
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,000
 is presented as a father.

912
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,340
 That when his children or when people

913
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,660
 who are running from him,

914
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,380
 when they look in his direction,

915
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,940
 you know what it says?

916
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,540
 He's filled with compassion towards them

917
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,620
 and a heart that when they move towards God,

918
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,260
 God runs after them.

919
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,540
 Every person, regardless of their sexual orientation

920
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,080
 and the life that they're living,

921
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,580
 God's greatest concern is being restored back

922
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,860
 to their father, not them behaving

923
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,540
 while they're separated from him.

924
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,780
 So the first thing is we call people Christ.

925
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,700
 The second C is we're committed to loving people,

926
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,740
 not changing people.

927
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,700
 Loving people, not changing people.

928
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,580
 People are not projects to complete.

929
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,860
 They are people to love.

930
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,440
 The church does not offer conversion therapy.

931
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,440
 The spirit of God is firmly responsible for change.

932
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,820
 In other words, it's not my job,

933
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,060
 it's not your job to try to change anybody.

934
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,060
 Our job is to love people, to present the gospel to people

935
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,260
 and to trust the spirit of God to bring about change

936
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,780
 in people's life.

937
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,620
 It is firmly the spirit of God that restores

938
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,220
 and works through people's sexuality,

939
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,820
 but it is not projects or it's not my job anymore

940
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,340
 that it is your job to work through and to bring change.

941
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,460
 Only the spirit of God can do that.

942
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,900
 It would be a disservice if I said,

943
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,820
 man, if somebody comes to Jesus,

944
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,380
 the spirit of God will always change

945
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,480
 their sexual orientation because sometimes he doesn't.

946
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,180
 And he allows people to showcase,

947
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,600
 you know what, I trusted in Jesus.

948
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,120
 It's been years.

949
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,540
 And I thought he would change some of my desires

950
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,260
 for the same sex, but he hasn't, but he's enough.

951
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,540
 And if nobody goes with me, I'm gonna follow him.

952
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,740
 And even my sexuality, I'll surrender to him.

953
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,580
 And as much as it would be a disservice for me

954
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,700
 to promise that he would change,

955
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,320
 it would also be a disservice for me to say

956
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,480
 that he never does because 1 Corinthians 6 says,

957
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,660
 such were some of you who practiced

958
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,680
 and lived homosexual lifestyles,

959
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,360
 but you were cleansed, you were washed, you were made new.

960
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,920
 And sometimes God does come in.

961
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,340
 The story's all over here where God

962
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,260
 and the spirit of God brings change in people's life,

963
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,100
 but the role of the church is to love people.

964
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,460
 We should be better lovers of the LGBTQ community

965
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,540
 than any other group.

966
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,760
 The acceptance, love, affirmation, all of those things,

967
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,280
 we have access to the source of them, which is God.

968
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,860
 And any community that loves better,

969
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,880
 shame on us as a church.

970
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
 And so loving people and caring about them

971
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,280
 and their story, where they're at.

972
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,920
 Finally, celebrating faithfulness to God's way.

973
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,300
 Or one more, celebrating faithfulness to God's way.

974
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,860
 What does it look like to have God-like love?

975
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,700
 God is a God who we're told, when people are faithful

976
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,980
 and they follow him and they go all in

977
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,980
 and they surrender their life and they're walking with him,

978
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,140
 there's gonna come a day where he goes,

979
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,900
 man, well done, good and faithful servant.

980
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,340
 Matthew chapter 25, verse 23 says,

981
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,900
 so to those of you in the room

982
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,220
 who are handling your singleness God's way,

983
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,900
 in other words, you're deciding that,

984
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,540
 hey, you know, I could go get married tomorrow.

985
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,000
 I could get on 17 dating apps.

986
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,720
 I could lower the bar right down here

987
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,600
 and I could get married and I could do it.

988
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,360
 And I could cross boundaries sexually

989
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,160
 'cause that's what most guys out there

990
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,440
 and most girls out there are gonna be willing to do

991
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,400
 and I could do all of that.

992
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,240
 But I'm choosing to say, Jesus, you're enough.

993
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,760
 And if I'm single forever, you're enough.

994
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,900
 And I really hope that's not the case,

995
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,540
 but I believe you're enough.

996
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,080
 And so help me to trust and help me to know

997
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,320
 and help me to walk in that.

998
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,120
 I am so, so, so proud of you.

999
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,880
 You inspire me, you strengthen my faith.

1000
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,140
 You're the people in the room who have same sex attraction

1001
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
 and you find yourself going,

1002
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,820
 is God ever gonna allow me to have someone

1003
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,380
 in the type of relationship that I hear other people having,

1004
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,660
 that other people wanna look forward to

1005
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,140
 or even can look forward to.

1006
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,320
 And when I think about it, I'm filled with despair

1007
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,780
 and honestly, grief that I may never have that in this life.

1008
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,200
 But Jesus, you're enough.

1009
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,100
 Though none go with me, I'm gonna follow you

1010
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,580
 and I'm walking after and I'm not gonna listen to the lies

1011
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,060
 of the community around me that told me,

1012
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,220
 man, you were born this way.

1013
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,180
 God doesn't care.

1014
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,380
 God, you have saved me.

1015
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,500
 You're good, you're for me, and I believe you.

1016
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,460
 You are enough.

1017
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,300
 Help me to believe that you are enough.

1018
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,260
 You inspire me, you strengthen my faith.

1019
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,400
 You make me wanna follow Jesus more.

1020
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,460
 I'm so, so proud of you.

1021
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,220
 I couldn't say that enough.

1022
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,100
 And you can golf clap or not, I don't care,

1023
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,740
 but I need you to hear me.

1024
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,620
 I'm so proud of you.

1025
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,900
 You've strengthened this church.

1026
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,980
 You've strengthened the church of God.

1027
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,140
 May God multiply your kind.

1028
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,780
 'Cause you live in a world that tells you the lie

1029
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,220
 every single day.

1030
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,500
 You should do whatever you want

1031
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,980
 who cares if some book of the Bible says you shouldn't.

1032
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,420
 And you look those people in the face

1033
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,940
 and you say, Jesus is enough.

1034
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,020
 He's my King, I will follow him.

1035
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,660
 I'm not gonna follow the ways of this world.

1036
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,860
 And I'm so proud of you.

1037
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,340
 And you make me wanna follow Christ.

1038
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,220
 'Cause here's the honest thing.

1039
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,620
 You can't coast.

1040
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,020
 There's a lot of people in the room.

1041
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,740
 You're not engaged in homosexual sin,

1042
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,180
 but you're looking at pornography every day

1043
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,140
 and it's just as offensive to God.

1044
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,740
 It's just as offensive.

1045
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,940
 Candidly, the most prevalent sin here

1046
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,300
 is not homosexual sin, it's heterosexual sin.

1047
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,060
 And it is just as offensive to God.

1048
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,940
 You're crossing boundaries physically

1049
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,140
 and it is just as offensive to God.

1050
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,820
 And if you do it under the name of love is love

1051
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,620
 or just 'cause you are in love,

1052
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,660
 it is an offense to God who loves you,

1053
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,300
 who doesn't want you to feel the shame and guilt

1054
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,420
 that you feel right now even as a man.

1055
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,260
 He doesn't want you to feel the shame and guilt

1056
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,460
 that you feel right now even as I'm talking.

1057
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,500
 He wants you to have just relationships

1058
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,740
 that flourish in line with his will

1059
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,020
 and in line with his way.

1060
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:53,340
 But to those of you who are walking faithfully, well done,

1061
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,580
 I'm so encouraged.

1062
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,260
 You humble and convict and strengthen me

1063
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,860
 and make me wanna go all in more with God.

1064
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,620
 Finally, the final C is to confess sin.

1065
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,260
 To love people if you are not healing

1066
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,940
 and healing from the own sexual sin

1067
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,600
 or your own sexual sin inside of your past.

1068
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,940
 That you would be in relationships with other people

1069
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,860
 where you can confess current struggles.

1070
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,700
 'Cause let's be honest, dude,

1071
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,700
 there's not a guy in this room where for the most of us,

1072
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,100
 like people being shocked about,

1073
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,340
 "I can't believe you looked at pornography."

1074
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,860
 Are you kidding me?

1075
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,200
 In a second, you're gonna have access

1076
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,060
 to naked women everywhere?

1077
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,380
 It's never surprising to me.

1078
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,820
 It's like that old, what was the commercial

1079
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,660
 where it's like, "That was easy, that was easy."

1080
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,860
 Staples, that's how sexual sin is.

1081
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,300
 It's like, "Oh man, yeah, you know,

1082
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,900
 "she's my girlfriend and she wants, you know,

1083
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,240
 "to take her clothes off of me.

1084
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,700
 "That was easy, okay."

1085
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,580
 It's not surprising when sin happens.

1086
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,900
 And if you don't have people in your life

1087
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,740
 that you can confess like,

1088
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,940
 "Hey, I'm being tempted to look at pornography right now.

1089
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,080
 "I pulled up pictures on Instagram

1090
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,980
 "and honestly, I was just looking

1091
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,220
 "for a girl in a bikini pic."

1092
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,900
 Or, "Hey, me and my boyfriend, we're crossing boundaries

1093
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,420
 "and I haven't told anybody."

1094
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,480
 Your faith, there's a roaring lion

1095
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,780
 who looks to kill and destroy, named Satan.

1096
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,460
 He wants to kill your relationship.

1097
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,340
 He wants to kill your relationship with Christ.

1098
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,780
 He wants you to stay alone and in shame.

1099
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,460
 Faith lives in the light and it dies in the dark.

1100
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,740
 Sin lives in the dark and it dies in the light.

1101
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,940
 And if you don't have people,

1102
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,900
 that's why we harp on community.

1103
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,620
 You've gotta have people you can confess,

1104
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,100
 past sexual sin, sexual relationships,

1105
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,500
 current sexual sin of any form,

1106
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,540
 heterosexual, homosexual, whatever it is.

1107
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,820
 Some of you, you need to get rid of your smartphone tonight.

1108
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,780
 You need to add Covenant Eyes to your computer,

1109
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,500
 to your iPad, to your phone, whatever it is.

1110
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,940
 I couldn't encourage, if pornography's a part of your story

1111
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,740
 like mine, adding the software of Covenant Eyes

1112
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,540
 or something called XXX Church, which is another software.

1113
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,100
 I know a lot of you are like, "What are you talking about?"

1114
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,700
 That is in your story right now.

1115
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
 Covenant Eyes.

1116
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,300
 It's a software to add on there

1117
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,900
 that allows for accountability,

1118
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,700
 for you to not make decisions that pull your faith

1119
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,300
 in a direction you don't want it to go to.

1120
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,140
 We all get thirsty, but it is not okay when I'm thirsty

1121
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,580
 to go drink from the toilet.

1122
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,220
 But I gotta be honest.

1123
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,980
 I wanna go drink from the toilet a lot.

1124
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,020
 And I need people that I could say,

1125
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:29,020
 "Man, I am having thoughts about a past sexual relationship

1126
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,260
 "or about someone that I saw at work

1127
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,020
 "or about somebody who posted something on Instagram."

1128
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,500
 And I need you guys to pray for me, to know,

1129
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,460
 and to follow up and ask me,

1130
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,060
 do you have those types of relationships?

1131
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,740
 And I don't know what it is, and I know this may even have

1132
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,700
 like a guy bent to it.

1133
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,140
 I know there's a lot of girls

1134
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,820
 that struggle with the same thing.

1135
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,500
 Whatever your struggle is, do you have people in your life

1136
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,700
 that you can be open and honest with?

1137
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,380
 Maybe tonight the best thing you could do

1138
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,540
 is to just open up with someone in your community group

1139
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,220
 to share, to share that thing you thought

1140
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,380
 you were gonna take to the grave

1141
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,820
 that you've never told anyone.

1142
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,460
 And you'll release its power because sin

1143
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,540
 and the power of it dies in the light,

1144
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,780
 but it lives in the dark.

1145
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:16,220
 Finally, what does the love of God or God love look like?

1146
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,740
 And I'll close here.

1147
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:25,860
 I know that as common as sin of sexual path,

1148
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,260
 sexual past, or sexual present is,

1149
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:34,260
 and living in a way that God says in his word

1150
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,980
 is not how he wants for you, what he wants for you,

1151
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,940
 equally as common is the lie that man,

1152
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,340
 because of my past, I'm damaged goods.

1153
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,380
 Because of the things that I've done,

1154
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,940
 because of the relationships that I've been a part of,

1155
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,420
 because of all the decisions that I've made,

1156
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,420
 like I'm damaged goods, and if there's a godly guy

1157
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,460
 or a godly girl out there,

1158
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,900
 like everything you're talking about, preacher,

1159
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,060
 that's all cool, but that's not gonna work out here

1160
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,900
 in the real world.

1161
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,260
 Like we live in planet Earth,

1162
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,020
 and so it's really cool when we're in here in church

1163
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,780
 and you kind of talk about stuff and I'm encouraged,

1164
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,180
 but when I go back to my normal life,

1165
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,220
 there's just not godly guys out there,

1166
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,180
 there's not godly girls out there,

1167
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,940
 and there's not people that are gonna be interested

1168
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,820
 in someone with my past, with my struggles,

1169
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,900
 with my problems.

1170
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:18,100
 And to you, I wanna say, how will a godly guy look at you?

1171
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,580
 That's part of your story?

1172
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,620
 That's a part of where you are right now?

1173
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,220
 How is a godly guy gonna look at you?

1174
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,500
 Like Jesus did.

1175
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,580
 Which brings the question,

1176
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,380
 how did Jesus look at people

1177
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,860
 in the midst of their sexual brokenness?

1178
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,300
 In the midst of just having a sexual past,

1179
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,700
 in the midst of making decisions

1180
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,620
 that were not God's will as it relates sexually?

1181
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,340
 We're actually told a story of his interaction with a woman

1182
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,020
 who was caught flat out in the midst

1183
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,740
 of her sexual brokenness.

1184
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,780
 And a godly guy will not look at you

1185
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,100
 like anything other than how Jesus looks at you.

1186
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,660
 A godly guy will look at you like Jesus looked.

1187
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,180
 And we're told that Jesus has this woman

1188
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,860
 thrown in front of him who's caught in adultery,

1189
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,780
 in sexual sin, she's thrown out

1190
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,460
 while Jesus is out teaching the crowds,

1191
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,020
 and this group of religious leaders brings this woman in,

1192
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,820
 it's in John chapter eight,

1193
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,660
 and they bring this woman

1194
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,140
 and they throw him down in front of him,

1195
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,820
 and they begin to form a circle around him,

1196
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,340
 and they say, "Jesus, this woman was caught

1197
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,380
 "having sex with another man's wife,

1198
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,180
 "or another man's husband."

1199
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,500
 And the law says that anyone who commits adultery like this

1200
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,860
 is deserving of the death penalty, to be stoned.

1201
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,820
 What do you say?

1202
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,140
 I mean, this woman is guilty by all accounts.

1203
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,420
 This woman does not deserve for the son of God

1204
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,660
 to do anything other than say,

1205
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,460
 "Man, that's what the law cries for."

1206
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,740
 What does God,

1207
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:50,700
 God, creator of the heavens, moons, stars,

1208
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,000
 all that is, every cell in your body,

1209
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,540
 every person who's ever lived,

1210
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,500
 formed you in your mother's womb,

1211
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,940
 holds everything together.

1212
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,300
 He walked on the planet for 33 years,

1213
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,660
 and we're told there's a moment,

1214
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,740
 he's standing before a woman who's committed adultery.

1215
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,380
 She just got through sleeping with somebody

1216
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,260
 who is not her husband.

1217
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,500
 She's married, and this dude wasn't her husband.

1218
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,780
 She's dragged in front of him,

1219
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,060
 and Jesus, he looks at the woman,

1220
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,420
 looks at the crowd that just said,

1221
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,820
 "She deserves to die, Jesus.

1222
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,980
 "What are you gonna do?"

1223
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,340
 And we're told he bends down on the ground,

1224
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,040
 he begins writing with his finger.

1225
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,380
 And we're told, we're not told what he writes,

1226
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,460
 and he just sits there for a second,

1227
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,180
 and then he stands up and he says,

1228
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,580
 "Let the person who is without sin cast the first stone."

1229
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,140
 And then he sits back down,

1230
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,220
 and he just writes on the ground again with his finger.

1231
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,180
 And we're told that the crowd,

1232
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,660
 from the oldest to the youngest, just walked away.

1233
00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:01,340
 And then it's just the Son of God and the adulteress.

1234
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,300
 And he's bent over, and he looks at her,

1235
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,500
 and he looks in the eye.

1236
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,760
 Says, "Where is everyone who accused you?"

1237
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
 "They've all left."

1238
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,280
 She said, "They've all left."

1239
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,540
 And then he says, "Neither do I condemn you.

1240
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:27,480
 "Go and sin no more."

1241
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,400
 John chapter eight, verse 11.

1242
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,700
 "Go now and leave your life of sin."

1243
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,680
 Jesus says, "I don't condone."

1244
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,500
 That's what he's saying.

1245
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,000
 Hey, I don't condone what you were just doing.

1246
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,280
 Let's just be abundantly clear.

1247
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,760
 I don't condemn you.

1248
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,880
 And I'm inviting you and calling you to a life

1249
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,500
 that is so much better and so much greater

1250
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,340
 than what you are.

1251
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,280
 Your sexual sin right now doesn't define you.

1252
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,400
 It doesn't make me not want to have a relationship with you.

1253
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,360
 And it doesn't disqualify you from being someone

1254
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,520
 that God wants to use every part of your story,

1255
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,140
 every part of your past, every part of your present,

1256
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,480
 to be someone that God writes an amazing story,

1257
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,040
 either of redemption, an amazing story of protection,

1258
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,200
 an amazing story of you showcasing to the world,

1259
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,200
 Jesus is enough, no matter what my love life looks like.

1260
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,600
 And no sexual sin and no sexual past keeps the son of God

1261
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,920
 from this woman or keeps him from you,

1262
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,320
 or keeps him from sexually broken people like me.

1263
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,480
 But he doesn't condone and say, "Carry on."

1264
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,180
 But neither does he condemn.

1265
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:34,320
 You need to know a godly man, a godly woman,

1266
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,800
 will see you like Jesus sees you.

1267
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,000
 You are not damaged goods.

1268
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,400
 He is not done with you yet.

1269
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,740
 (congregation laughing)

1270
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,080
 But the choice is yours.

1271
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,980
 So now embrace love is love with the God who is love,

1272
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,280
 and embrace his love for you.

1273
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,320
 Let me pray.

1274
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,220
 Father, I pray for anyone in this room

1275
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,000
 who's believing the lie.

1276
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,360
 Their sexuality is fixed and firm and must be obeyed.

1277
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,780
 And they must follow wherever love leads.

1278
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,740
 They would follow the God who is love,

1279
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:17,240
 who calls them to life,

1280
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,960
 who loved them so much that he gave his life for them.

1281
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,860
 You would dispense the lies.

1282
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,520
 All of us are tempted to believe.

1283
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,920
 You would dispense the lies about our sexual past,

1284
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,880
 and you would be bigger and greater

1285
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,680
 and have victory over those things

1286
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,340
 in our hearts and in our minds.

1287
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,320
 Would we love you more,

1288
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,680
 and would the relationships that we have

1289
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,080
 as it relates to love be filled and defined

1290
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,060
 by the love of God?

1291
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,440
 Would we pursue purity?

1292
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,600
 Would we find healing?

1293
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:55,760
 And would we look more like our savior, Jesus?

1294
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,600
 Amen.
