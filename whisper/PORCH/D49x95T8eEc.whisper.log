[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:24.840]   - How we doing?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.980]   If you could go anywhere or do anything,
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.760]   where would you go and what would you do?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.080]   I just want you to think on that for a second.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.280]   If you could go anywhere in the world,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.440]   anywhere on the planet,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.200]   some of you super righteous people are like,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.440]   heaven, no, not, anywhere on the planet,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.680]   and you could do anything, what would you do?
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.600]   This is the question I ask guys
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.520]   when I begin to meet with them.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.120]   So like discipleship on day one, I kind of go,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.880]   as I've done this, I kind of do the same thing.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.640]   And so day one, I always ask them,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.440]   hey, if you could go anywhere and you could do anything,
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.800]   what would you do?
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.440]   And then the second question I ask them
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.980]   is the same question I'm about to ask you.
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.880]   If you've thought about that, if you have an answer,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.880]   what is preventing you from doing that now?
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.960]   Why haven't you done that?
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.120]   Right, you got your life in front of you.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.240]   Most of you are single.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.160]   Why haven't you gone?
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.120]   And the reason I ask that question
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.200]   is because in two questions, as I get to know guys,
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.600]   it shows me their desires and it shows me their fears.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.280]   Some of them, not exhaustively, but some of their desires,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.360]   I get to know them a little bit,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.400]   and it shows me some of their fears,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.320]   the things that would hold them back.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.200]   And as we were talking about this in sermon prep recently,
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.520]   my friend Garrett, who leads us out in Fort Worth,
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.840]   he said, you know, I just did it, I just went on that trip.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.680]   And I was like, you did?
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.520]   I was like, well, tell me about it.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.980]   And he goes, well, you know, I got a GoPro
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.800]   right before we went and I got some footage.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   Do you wanna see it?
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.160]   And I said, sure, yeah, yeah, sure.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.920]   I'll watch your little amateur GoPro video, that's fine.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.200]   And as I watched it, I was like, oh, man.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   Where was my invite, dog?
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.920]   Like, you don't wanna call a brother?
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.840]   And so anyway, I'll just show you what he showed me.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.800]   Just watch this few minutes of his trip.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.000]   This is where he did, this is where he went.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.080]   I was like, man, are you serious?
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.420]   I mean, you didn't go to Sao Padre.
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.860]   I mean, you went on a trip, right?
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.660]   So 11 days, seven flights, five countries, right?
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.460]   Bali, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.940]   And I'm like, bro, where was my invitation?
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.080]   I feel like I missed out on the adventure.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.320]   And tonight we're talking about missing out
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.260]   on the adventure.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.060]   Some of you think, man, if I become a Christian,
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.820]   I gotta forfeit my fun.
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.260]   I'm not gonna have fun anymore.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.700]   I mean, I used to think that.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.660]   I used to look at those really serious Christians.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.420]   They didn't make, honestly, a lot of Christians,
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.860]   didn't make Christianity look all that much fun.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.680]   I was like, I don't wanna do that.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.820]   And some of you, you got one foot in the world,
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.300]   one foot in the church, and you're missing out on both.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.920]   You haven't fully embraced both.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.340]   You got these sins that you're carrying with you,
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.720]   and I don't mean like we're all sinners.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.300]   I mean like things that are coming
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.200]   between you and Christ, real idols.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.940]   Others of you are like, man, I've been in a church,
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.880]   my entire life, and I know what religion is.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.340]   It's a bunch of rules, and I follow them,
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.580]   and I'm really good at keeping them.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.820]   And you don't know Jesus.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.840]   And you're missing out on the adventure
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.540]   that I see in this book that Christ calls us to.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.860]   And I don't want you to.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.060]   In fact, I'm real passionate about you jumping
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.460]   on the adventure with us.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.940]   I'm telling you, Jesus has invited us on an adventure.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.260]   So as we move through this series, missing out,
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.620]   we've talked about this idea of FOMO, right?
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.140]   This thing that our generation has created,
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.340]   the fear of missing out.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.020]   Tonight we're talking about missing out on the adventure.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.660]   And I've been very, very vocal.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.520]   If you've hung out with us for a while,
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.340]   that sin robs you of creativity.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.380]   As I look back on my life, I realize
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.620]   that I was doing the same things,
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.060]   taking the same shots of Patron,
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.820]   going to the same bars, the same clubs,
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.980]   sleeping with the same girl, doing the same drugs,
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.640]   and thinking that was life.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.260]   What a joke.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.100]   What, like a dog to his vomit.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.740]   What a joke, I was deceived.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.460]   And you know what, I thought Christians were deceived.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.940]   And I was deceived.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.740]   And I don't want you to be deceived.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.660]   And so what does it look like if we went all in with Jesus?
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.020]   'Cause I'm telling you, man, if you're stuck
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.980]   in that routine of doing the same things,
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.080]   expecting different results, you're missing out
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.260]   on the adventure Christ is calling you to.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.240]   In fact, idols in our lives cause us
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.060]   to miss out on real worship.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.020]   And lukewarm, Americanized Christianity
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.920]   causes us to miss out on the adventure
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.540]   that Jesus has called us to.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.980]   And I don't want that either.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.980]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.300]   Before we go any further in the message,
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.820]   I just want you to reflect on something.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.420]   What if you believed God was real?
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.460]   There's a God, a creator God, the heavens and the earth,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.900]   he controls everything, he loves you.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.980]   What if you just, at a heart level,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.300]   what would your life look like if you completely grasped
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.060]   that what if you believed God is real, the Bible is true,
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.140]   Jesus is the way, and there's a heaven and there's a hell
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.560]   and everybody goes somewhere?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.620]   What if you believed that with all your heart,
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.220]   like you were, you like woke up and you're like,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.240]   I know for a fact, God is real, the Bible is true,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.580]   Jesus is the way, and there's heaven and hell,
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.700]   and we're all gonna spend eternity somewhere.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.400]   What would your life look like?
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.680]   If you believed that with all your heart,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.920]   what would you do, how would you live, where would you go?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.740]   And what's holding you back right now from going all in?
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.700]   So tonight we're gonna look at possibly
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.440]   the most relevant passage in the scripture
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.200]   to Dallas and Fort Worth.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   It's a real life account of Jesus interacting with someone.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.120]   It's not a parable, it's not a fictional story
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.280]   told for a purpose, this is a real account of Jesus
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.160]   interacting with someone that I would say,
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.960]   arguably, we all want to be.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.520]   And it's interesting to me that we wanna be most,
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.080]   the person from the scripture that we wanna be the most
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.880]   is the person who did not follow Christ.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.280]   And you're like, no, JB, I don't wanna be someone
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.440]   who didn't follow Christ, I wanna be someone
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.880]   who did follow Christ, but I would say the way
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.360]   that we live our lives, most of us tonight in this room,
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.160]   the way that we live our lives says that who we wanna be
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.160]   most like is the one who is young, who is wealthy,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.720]   and who is powerful, known in the scriptures
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.000]   as the rich young ruler.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.960]   And so that's where we'll be in Mark 10.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.320]   And specifically, we're gonna talk about this adventure,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.480]   what is not needed, what is needed to go on the adventure,
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   and what you gain from the adventure in Mark chapter 10.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   This story, in fact, shows up in all the synoptic gospels.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.280]   Synoptic just means the firsthand account.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.200]   These people, Matthew, Mark, and Luke,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.040]   they all wrote the gospels based on what they saw.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.320]   Then John, not part of the synoptic gospels,
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.960]   but a part of the gospels, wrote his account much later,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.280]   or later, I'll say.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.840]   And so Matthew, Mark, Luke, they're just writing down
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.560]   what they see, the synoptic gospels.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.800]   And so all three of them have this story in their account.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.560]   And so we have lots of details from this story.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.120]   We know this guy pretty well.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.480]   We know that he was a ruler, that he was powerful,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.120]   we know that he was young, he was a young adult,
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.320]   he beat here at the porch.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.480]   We know that he had lots of money.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.880]   All of these accounts tell us,
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.320]   we gather these details from these three accounts.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.400]   In Mark chapter 10, he says this.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.680]   Now, I love what the ESV says.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.080]   It says, "Jesus was on a journey."
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.840]   Jesus was on an adventure.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.640]   He sets out on an adventure.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.800]   Here in the NIV, it says this.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.840]   "As Jesus started on his way,
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.520]   "a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him,"
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.880]   and says, "Good teacher."
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.160]   In Greek, it's perfect rabbi.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.360]   He asked, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.440]   He asked the question you wanna know the answer to.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.240]   What do I gotta do to get into heaven?
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.920]   And he asks sincerely, he falls on,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.080]   Christ, good rabbi,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.440]   what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.240]   What must I do?
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.280]   He's looking to be affirmed.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.840]   Jesus says, "Why do you call me good?"
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.240]   Jesus answered, "No one is good except God alone."
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.240]   Some of the cults would use this passage to say,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.960]   see there, Jesus rejected this idea that he was God,
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.800]   but he didn't.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.600]   We can see through the bigger breadth of the scriptures.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.200]   Jesus is challenging this man's idea.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.920]   It is very clear in the scriptures that Jesus is God.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.120]   He received worship.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.360]   He says, "I and the Father are one.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.080]   "You, whoever has seen me, has seen the Father."
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.040]   But here, he's challenging this man's idea of good
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.160]   'cause this man says that humans,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.800]   believing Jesus is human, can be perfectly good.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.320]   And so he says, "Hey, you're good.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.640]   "What must I do to be good
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.000]   "and enter into the kingdom of heaven?"
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.960]   And Jesus says, "Why do you call me good?
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.800]   "No one's good except God alone.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.720]   "You know the commandments.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.740]   "You shall not murder.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.940]   "You shall not commit adultery.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.000]   "You shall not steal.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.620]   "You shall not give false testimony.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.260]   "You shall not defraud.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.760]   "Honor your father and mother."
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.960]   And so Jesus gives the second table of the 10 commandments,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.780]   which are that section of the 10 commandments
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.400]   which are most easily measured.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.800]   You can measure your performance in these commands from God.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.960]   And the guy cuts him off.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.540]   Says, "Teacher, rabbi," he declared,
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.840]   "all these things I've kept since I was a boy."
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.680]   He's looking to be a father.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.540]   "Hey, I got good news.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.900]   "I've done those things.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.540]   "I've done those things."
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.720]   Ladies, as a side note,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.400]   if there's a guy here, he's got a Bible,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.360]   and he goes to church, and he's memorized some scriptures,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.880]   it doesn't mean he knows Jesus.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.360]   Hey, guys, as a side note,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.280]   there's a lady here.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.120]   She's got a Bible.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.680]   She goes to church, even serves there in the nursery,
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.840]   memorized some passage.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.960]   It does not mean she knows Jesus.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.480]   This guy, this guy was a great rule follower.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.560]   He was killing it.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.620]   The Pharisees would have said,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.000]   "Man, this guy, he needs to go start a church."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.200]   Jesus says, "He doesn't know me."
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.560]   And so my first point this evening
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.460]   is performance is not your passport.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.680]   Your performance is not your passport to this adventure.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.520]   This guy wants the adventure of eternal life,
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.280]   and he's hoping he's good enough for it,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.120]   and he comes up, and he says,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.140]   "Hey, you're good.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.060]   "I wanna be good.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.680]   "Who's good enough to get into heaven?"
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.080]   But the scriptures say this really key fact,
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.960]   and you've gotta hear this.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.080]   In fact, write this part down.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.980]   No one's good enough to get into heaven.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.600]   No one is good enough to get into heaven.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.440]   Now, some of you are just like,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   "What, that's harrowing.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.120]   "What are you talking about?"
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.200]   Ephesians 2, eight, nine says
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.620]   no one gets into heaven by what they do.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.480]   In fact, in Isaiah, God says,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.480]   "Your good works are like filthy rags to me."
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.960]   That's Isaiah 64, six.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.720]   No one is good enough to get into heaven.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.840]   The scripture said there is no one good, not even one.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.600]   And this man says, "What must I do?"
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.320]   And then he says, "I've done these things."
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   He's looking to himself, and this is why this is important.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.160]   Every single week, almost without fail,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.040]   I come up here and I meet with many of you.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.640]   I love my Dallas and Fort Worth young adults.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.660]   And I ask you, how certain are you that you go to heaven?
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.200]   And you give me an answer, and then I say,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.840]   if God says, "Why should I let you in?
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.720]   "What would you say?"
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.600]   And every single week, without fail,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.560]   someone answers that question.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.320]   If God says, "Why should I let you into heaven?
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.560]   "What would you say?"
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.860]   And they say, "Well, because I."
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:15.160]   "Well, because I try hard.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.480]   "And because I've done good things.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.320]   "Because I go to church.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   "Because my parents are Christians.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.640]   "Because I, because my."
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.880]   No one gets into heaven because I, because my.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.900]   The only people who'll get into heaven,
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.900]   because Jesus died for my sins.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.040]   Not 90% of my sins.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.920]   Not 99% of my sins.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.400]   100% of my sins, past, present, and future,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.000]   he died for, and I trusted in that.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.640]   His death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.120]   And so because of what God has done, I will go.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.500]   If I point to my resume, I've missed it.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.760]   If I point to God's resume, I've got it.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.800]   I'm not missing out.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.320]   And so you might be here, and you might be like,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.280]   "Oh, that's cool.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.000]   "This guy's clearly trying to follow the rules."
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.820]   You may be here and be like,
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.740]   "Well, I'm not trying to follow the rules.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.000]   "In fact, I'm living an adventure, JP.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.840]   "In fact, I got some money.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.740]   "I got a six-figure job, right?
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.000]   "And that trip Garrett and Phil
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.820]   "and Austin and Brian went on, easy, man.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.640]   "I'll book it next week, no big deal.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   "Get on Travelzoo, make it happen."
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.540]   You're gonna be like, "Man, I got resources.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.740]   "You're telling me I need to go on an adventure?
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.780]   "I'll make a habit, go on an adventure.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:27.760]   "What, Bali, Indonesia?
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.500]   "Where, let's go, man, Fiji, Bora Bora, let's go."
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.200]   And you're still missing out on the adventure.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.280]   It's not that the adventure's not the trip.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.640]   That's not the adventure.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.060]   The adventure's not the trip itself.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.740]   In fact, you know that Garrett and those guys,
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.320]   when they were in the airport,
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.460]   they bumped into some guys
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.060]   that were on the almost exact same trip as them.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.240]   And so they were talking, they had a great time catching up.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.400]   And it was clear that these guys
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   didn't have the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.720]   In fact, they were like, "Man, when we go to Bangkok,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.320]   "with a little bit of money, you can get anything."
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.000]   And as Garrett told me that,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.760]   I responded in the same way that they did in that airport,
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.600]   as they shared Christ with these young men.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.440]   Grieved.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.480]   'Cause we know, man, that's not a passport.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   That's a prison.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.200]   That's you being slave to something.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   There's real consequences to that,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.280]   that I don't want for you, that God doesn't want for you.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.920]   That may be temporary enjoyment for a moment,
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.240]   followed by a lifetime of covering up that temporary,
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.340]   trying to forget that temporary enjoyment.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.680]   Right?
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.480]   So you won't get to heaven by keeping the rules.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.340]   And you won't experience heaven here on earth
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.280]   by breaking them.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.280]   It's just a temporary satisfaction
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.680]   that ends in a not satisfaction at all.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.360]   It actually leads to slavery.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.540]   Your performance is not your passport.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.240]   What you do is not your passport.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.640]   We were planning a summer vacation a few years ago,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.080]   just before Weston was born,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.220]   and so we had Presley and Finley.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.840]   And they had never really traveled,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.760]   they had never been on an airplane.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.360]   And so we were thinking about where we would go,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.400]   and we found this deal to this all-inclusive resort
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.720]   that we had been to before on our honeymoon.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.780]   And this was kind of a sister company,
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.760]   and it had all of these things that you can do for kids,
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.960]   and splash pads, and everything.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.680]   And so we're really excited, it was in Mexico,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.960]   all-inclusive resort in Mexico,
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.800]   really excited to take the girls there.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.440]   And so about six months out, we booked a travel.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.760]   And I'm telling Presley and Finley
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.040]   kind of every night about this trip, man.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   And you're just like,
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.780]   they don't have a category for Mexico.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.460]   In fact, Mexico to them was like heaven.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.320]   It's just like this place, you can't imagine,
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.560]   it's so incredible.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.520]   I would tell them, and they're like,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.360]   daddy, and so they would ask me,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.640]   and they'd be like, daddy, tell us about Mexico.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.760]   And I'm like, all right.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.580]   Well, what do you wanna know?
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.040]   And they'd be like, daddy, is there a swimming pool there?
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.320]   And I'm like, oh, girls, come on,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.680]   is there a swimming pool there?
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.000]   Listen, you're going to see the largest swimming pool
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.040]   in the entire world, the biggest swimming pool
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.640]   that you could possibly imagine
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.920]   is going to be there in Mexico.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.060]   Where is it gonna be, like we drive there?
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.560]   No, it's gonna be right outside your room.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.680]   Our room, what do you mean?
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.480]   Like, we're gonna have a balcony, oh,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.360]   and you can sit, hang over the swimming pool,
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.400]   and there's the swimming pool.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.160]   And you know what's just past the swimming pool?
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.080]   Is the ocean, do y'all know what the ocean is?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.560]   And they're like, no, tell us about it.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.640]   And I'm like, you know, they're like, daddy,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.880]   is there fish in the ocean?
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.500]   I'm like, is there fish in the ocean?
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.160]   Girls, listen, you know what we're gonna do?
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.240]   Do you know what we're gonna do?
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.320]   I said, first of all, right in front of the ocean
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.160]   is the biggest sandbox you could ever imagine.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.120]   And we're gonna build sandcastles.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.040]   Sandcastles so big we could sleep in 'em.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.720]   And then, you know what we're gonna do?
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.880]   Now, I'm blowing their mind with this.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.480]   We're gonna swim with dolphins.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.280]   And they're like, what do you mean?
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.960]   And I'm like, well, there's dolphins,
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.800]   and we're gonna swim with 'em.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.240]   And you're like, we get to touch 'em?
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.080]   No, we get to touch 'em.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.680]   You're gonna hold on to their fin
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.360]   as they pull you through the water,
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.200]   and they're like, (imitates explosion)
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   What?
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.600]   Like, we're on an elevator, right,
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.120]   and Presley's just grinning ear to ear,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.440]   and this guy's like, oh, you,
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.880]   this strange man's like, oh, you're really happy, huh?
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.480]   She's like, I'm going to Mexico.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.640]   And so the day comes.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.200]   The day comes, we wake up early that morning.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.640]   Early that morning, we're packed.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.120]   The four of us are packed, you know?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.440]   And so we wake up early before the sun comes up,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.080]   and we drive to DFW Airport,
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.040]   and we park at Remote North Parking,
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.760]   and I get all of our bags.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.240]   You know, Monica and I are carrying their bags.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.040]   We get all their bags, and we go and wait for the shuttle,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.640]   and the shuttle comes, and they get on the shuttle.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.760]   And this is all very adventurous for them.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.920]   This is all very fun.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.760]   We get on the shuttle.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.720]   It takes us to the terminal.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.560]   We get off the terminal.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.240]   We take the long escalator up with all of our bags,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.960]   you know, to the desk, and we're checking in,
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.720]   and Monica checks in and gets her ticket.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.000]   Presley checks in and gets her ticket,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.080]   and I get up there, and she goes, oh, I'm sorry, sir.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.800]   We can't take your passport.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.240]   I'm like, (laughing)
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.720]   let's, you know, what, yeah, no, what do you mean?
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.880]   She's like, I'm sorry, sir,
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.200]   but, you know, your passport has clearly been washed
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.160]   or something, it's wrinkled.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.200]   I was like, we can't accept it.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, I promise you can.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.560]   You can, look, what, do you need an ID?
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.400]   What, do you need a credit card?
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.480]   Here's $100, you can take it, you know.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.960]   What are you talking about?
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   And she's like, no, sir, they won't let you in the country.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.880]   And so you can't go.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.280]   Well, what are you, no, no, I need to talk to your manager.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.160]   I mean, there's gonna be dolphins there
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.060]   and big sandbox and swimming pool.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.320]   Like, we gotta go to Mexico.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.560]   You don't understand, I've been, six months,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.400]   I've been telling 'em.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.040]   I'm like, hey, you gotta tell 'em.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.660]   I can't tell 'em, you tell 'em.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.200]   I can't break this news to 'em.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.800]   What do you mean I can't go?
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.160]   She's like, sir, I'm sorry, you can't go.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.160]   And nothing I could say would change that.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.800]   I didn't have what I needed for the adventure.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.220]   And that's what I don't want for you.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.520]   That's what's gotta change.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.240]   That's what I'm begging the Spirit of God
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.580]   to change in the next few minutes.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.880]   So we hang out together for just a few more minutes
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.760]   but the Spirit of God will come into your heart
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.480]   and give you what you need for the adventure
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.100]   and you would realize it's not your performance.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.940]   But what he's done, 2015 years ago,
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.860]   God becoming a man, living a perfect life
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.760]   and dying a perfect death on your behalf
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.880]   so that you could live the adventure with him starting now.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.320]   And so this guy says, all these things I've done,
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.720]   what's Jesus gonna say?
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.640]   What's he gonna say to me?
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.160]   Oh man, look at this guy, Mr. Self-righteous,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.320]   he's done all these things.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.800]   Oh, you've done, oh man, you've done all these things, huh?
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.720]   Does Jesus punk him?
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.080]   He's like, oh, who do you think you,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.760]   oh, you think you're good, huh?
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.000]   Oh, you think you're so good.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.400]   No, listen, sometimes I hear Jesus like that.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.760]   In fact, in the past when I've read this passage,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.520]   in Mark's account though, verse 21 is really key.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.720]   Jesus looked at him and judged him.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.160]   Nope, it's not what it says.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.060]   Jesus looked at him and loved him.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.420]   He had compassion on this guy.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.120]   And he says, man, I want him to get it.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.560]   So he goes after his idols.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.100]   He says, one thing you lack,
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.560]   go and sell everything you have and give it to the poor
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.220]   and you will have treasure in heaven, then come follow me.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.700]   And I read that, I'm like, oh, hold on.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.020]   It's like Jesus doesn't even know the answer.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.080]   That's not the right answer.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:37.920]   What's he doing there?
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.620]   And he's answering very strategically
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.460]   'cause he sees this guy's heart
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.940]   and he goes after his idols.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.640]   He says, hey, not to punk him, but to show him his heart,
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.660]   to show him his idols because he loves him,
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.220]   the scripture says.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.720]   He says, I wanna show you the idols that you have
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.780]   that prevent you from knowing me
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.100]   and having a relationship with me.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.220]   And so let me ask you a question.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.220]   What are your idols?
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.460]   What are the idols in your life that come before Christ?
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.980]   Is it money, is it a relationship, is it a job?
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.880]   Is it performance?
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.020]   Is it anxiety?
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.660]   Is it stuff, is it status?
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.420]   What are your idols before Jesus?
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   He tells him, go sell everything you have
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.700]   and give it to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.780]   And it says, at this, the man's face fell,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.760]   literally, he just becomes sad, like,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.420]   he knew he couldn't do that.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.720]   And he went away sad because it says he had great wealth.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:41.420]   And so Jesus is inviting him on the adventure of a lifetime
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   and all he needs to start that adventure is, ready, need.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.120]   That's what I think this passage is about.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.500]   All you need is need, my second point this evening.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   All you need for this adventure, for this trip, is need.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.700]   You have to have need.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.900]   You have to realize your need for God, that you need him.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.540]   To have a savior, you need to know
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.860]   that you need to be saved,
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.820]   that you're in a position where, man, I can't save myself.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.820]   There's something outside of me that has to save me.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.340]   That thing is Jesus.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.620]   See, Jesus comes to him, he says,
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.340]   hey, there's just one thing you lack.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.060]   He says, there's one thing you lack.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.260]   Go, sell, give, come, follow.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.180]   Five verbs.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.100]   One thing you lack, go, sell, give, come, follow.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.740]   Well, wait a minute, Jesus, that's five things.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.700]   What's the one thing he lacks?
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.540]   Need.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:36.420]   See, the stuff that you have, your money,
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.900]   your material possessions,
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.820]   those things are preventing you
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.020]   from having the thing that you need most, which is need.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.260]   You have surrounded your life with comfort,
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.100]   and therefore, that comfort has prevented you
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.740]   from being in a place where you need need.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.220]   I had a conversation recently with someone,
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.180]   they were just like, I don't enjoy God.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.260]   I was like, well, that's because
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.700]   you don't think you need him.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.900]   If you believe that he's the solution to your need,
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.460]   if he's the only thing that's gonna meet that need,
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.060]   you'll begin to enjoy him.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.900]   See, this man's wealth was a deterrent
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.540]   to what he needed most.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.780]   Because while his wealth brought comfort,
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.180]   what he needed was need.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.940]   And Jesus is testing his need and attacking his idols,
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.100]   or testing his need by attacking his idols.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.300]   Let me explain to you what I'm saying,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.900]   just in case I'm losing you, okay?
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.460]   In all three accounts of the Gospels,
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.620]   Matthew, Mark, and Luke, where this story falls,
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.260]   it's right after another story.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.980]   It's right after a story where Jesus says,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.180]   let me tell you who gets into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.380]   He answers this guy's question right before the story
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.500]   in all three Gospels.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.180]   You know who gets into the kingdom of heaven?
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.380]   He says, anyone who comes to me like a child.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.220]   Why is that in there?
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.500]   It's like God is shouting something at us.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.140]   Why does he want us to hear that?
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.500]   It's kind of an obscure verse, right?
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.660]   Mark 10, verse 15.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.300]   Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.780]   the kingdom of God like a little child
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.020]   will never enter it.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.780]   Do you guys know anything about kids?
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.460]   I've had three.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.300]   I mean, not personally,
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.420]   but I participated in someone having three.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:17.780]   And we have a little son now, he's two and a half years old.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.420]   And he is, let me just describe him to you.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.180]   He is need surrounded by noise.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.060]   That's who he is.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:28.940]   Like he contributes to Team Pecluta, zero.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.740]   He's never mowed the lawn.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.700]   He's never cleaned the house.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.860]   I mean, the other day,
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.660]   I thought he was gonna make himself breakfast
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.220]   and he poured the Cheerios all over the living room.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.180]   I mean, that's what he does.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.900]   He's need surrounded by noise.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.660]   He's never paid for anything.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.340]   He's never been like, daddy, I just wanna repay you
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.940]   for the way that you take care of me.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.940]   And so dinner's on me tonight.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.500]   I got it.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.540]   He doesn't have a job.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.700]   He doesn't financially contribute.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.500]   He is need surrounded by noise.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.180]   And Jesus says to you, you wanna know who gets me?
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.700]   People who come to me with dependence.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.540]   People who need.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.140]   See, some of you, what's gonna keep you
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.840]   out of the kingdom of heaven, which is no trite thing.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.460]   I'm just very emotional as I was writing this message
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.460]   thinking about that.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.660]   It's the fact you don't need God.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.500]   You got you.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.620]   You got stuff.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.100]   I mean, you got a good job.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.460]   You're gifted.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.780]   Pretty.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.140]   You don't need God.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:36.980]   What do you need God for?
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.820]   You got Dallas.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.640]   You got Fort Worth.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.820]   Why do you need God?
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.460]   And that's what's gonna keep you out.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.860]   I mean, this guy was in church every Sunday, man.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.260]   That's who this guy is.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.660]   But he didn't have need.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:59.860]   Jesus said, I want you to come to me like one of these.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:04.700]   This joker in Mark 10, Luke 18, Matthew 19,
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.740]   he doesn't even have a name.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.500]   He's just an example of what not to do.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.020]   And Jesus comes to him with a real invitation,
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.220]   a very rare invitation, okay,
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.620]   that we don't see a lot in the scripture, right?
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.860]   We see it with the disciples, the apostles.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.020]   Jesus comes to Matthew, says,
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.660]   hey, leave your tax collector booth and follow me.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.660]   He says to some other guys,
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.820]   hey, throw down your nets and follow me.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.460]   And then he comes to this rich young ruler.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.260]   He says, hey, I want you to sell everything you have,
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.180]   give it to the poor, then come and follow me.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.900]   This guy could have been the 13th disciple, right?
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.660]   I mean, these are guys we name our kids after.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.860]   These are arguably some of the most famous people
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.940]   in the history of history.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.860]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.300]   These are people whose books,
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.780]   their writings we teach from, we gather around
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.580]   and say, hey, will you just teach me what Matthew wrote?
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.060]   Let me name my friend Matthew.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.140]   Now here's, I don't know, Bob,
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.820]   and we don't even know his name, right?
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.140]   'Cause all we know is his resume.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.660]   We know he's rich, we know he's young,
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.380]   we know he's powerful, that's all we know.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.880]   And we know he's the guy that didn't follow Jesus.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.140]   Do you think he missed out on an adventure?
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.980]   Yeah, I think he missed out on an adventure.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.820]   Why?
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.140]   Because it says he had great wealth.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.820]   I love what Randy Alcorn said here this weekend
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.860]   as he visited, he said,
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.580]   things have mass and mass has gravity.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.800]   Don't let things be the center of gravity for you.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.020]   Said in another way, he says,
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.820]   don't let things that you can't let go of hold you back.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.440]   Don't let anything in your life that you can't let go of
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.280]   hold you back.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.100]   Is that a relationship?
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.460]   I don't know what that is for you,
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.980]   but is there any debate right now in your mind
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.540]   that we are the rich young rulers?
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.460]   Like, are you there, you're like,
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.300]   well, hey, I don't have any,
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.500]   I'm lost on this 'cause I'm not rich.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.060]   Let me tell you something, you are unbelievably rich
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.020]   just because of where you are.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.140]   Minimum wage in America, if you make minimum wage,
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.820]   you are in the top 10% richest people on the planet.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.420]   The average wage is around $2 a day.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.900]   In Indonesia, it's 39 cents an hour.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.740]   Okay?
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.100]   If you make $50,000, you are deep within the top 1%
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.940]   of the wealthiest people on the planet.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.780]   If you're wondering where I get this,
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.060]   it comes from globalrichlist.com.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.820]   I had a friend who went to Russia for 10 years.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.180]   He came back and we said, we asked him as a staff,
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.740]   as we kind of interviewed him and asked him questions,
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.340]   we said, hey, what was different?
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.440]   What changed about Dallas-Fort Worth?
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.460]   And he said, you want me to, you know,
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.460]   I have an answer to that.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.800]   It's kind of a strange one.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.640]   We said, what?
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.260]   He said, storage buildings.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.580]   They're everywhere.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.340]   He's like, you guys have built huge buildings
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.740]   to store your stuff because you have so much stuff,
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.900]   you can't even keep it on your own property.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.600]   You had to get another property to keep your stuff on.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.100]   You know the greatest health problem in America?
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.180]   Like you go somewhere else and it's like,
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.580]   well, clean water, right?
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.540]   Food to eat.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.220]   In America, it's obesity.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.880]   Like we're the first country in the history of the world,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.380]   right, that our primary health problem is obesity.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.740]   Like you look at any time in the past and it's like,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.820]   what's their primary health problem?
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.020]   They're starving to death.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.660]   Us, we've got so much food, we don't know where to keep it.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.780]   We keep it on us.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.860]   Just think about it for a moment.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.780]   It'll blow your mind too.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.620]   I mean, it's great.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.300]   This is us, right?
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.700]   Because of where you live,
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.660]   you are among the wealthiest people on the planet.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.660]   You're like, dude, I don't even have a job.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.540]   You know what, I didn't have a job once.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.780]   I was laid off.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.220]   You know what I did?
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.820]   Because I woke up in America,
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.060]   I got up early that morning and I began to knock on doors
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.020]   and I said, you know what, I'm gonna make $100 today.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.620]   And the first door I knocked on, I said,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.540]   hey, can I rake your leaves?
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.380]   They said, sure.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.420]   I said, what will you pay me?
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.380]   80 bucks.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.580]   Awesome, you got it.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:58.220]   Because of where I live, that opportunity is afforded to me.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.060]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.900]   Here's why.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.600]   Because opportunities like that combat need.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.560]   It's really, really hard to be needy when you have a lot.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.300]   Like, do you realize that our brothers and sisters
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.140]   of the faith, 21 brothers and sisters of the faith
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.680]   lost their head a few days ago.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.780]   They were beheaded like Paul.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.820]   Like John the Baptist, their heads were cut off.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.500]   And you know, if ISIS was here,
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.360]   my greatest fear would not be
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.620]   that they would take our heads off.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.020]   It would be that they would have no reason to.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:38.340]   Amen, hey, I got a Christian over here.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.660]   You sure, you sure that's a Christian?
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.540]   No, he's not a Christian.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.140]   I saw him on Lord Greenwood, that's not a Christian.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.340]   No, leave their head on.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.380]   No, I saw him with that girl the other day.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.740]   I think he's clean, man.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.580]   Let him go.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.700]   He's one of us.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.900]   I got a Christian over here.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.740]   No, she's not, no, she's not.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.940]   I've been watching her, she's not a Christian.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.860]   She had no Christ.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.400]   Let her go, keep her head on.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.240]   Man, are you serious?
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.780]   The world we live in.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.220]   I wanna be clear, I just wanna say it one more time
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.660]   in case you think I'm coming with workspace stuff.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.620]   All you need is need.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.380]   You gotta need him.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.960]   You gotta need him.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:30.900]   Money, money may not be your idol,
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.180]   but it funds them.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.140]   You wanna know what your idol is?
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.600]   You look at your time and your money.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.660]   Look at your calendar and your checkbook.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:46.300]   Okay, let me just ask you a question.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.980]   Let's just say you could break into this story
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.820]   right here, man.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.100]   Let's say you could talk to this rich young ruler.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.180]   Like Jesus is like, hey, go and sell everything you have.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.420]   Give it to the poor and then come follow me.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.060]   And he's like, he leaves sad.
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.100]   You could step in right there.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.940]   You could talk to him.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:02.760]   What do you say?
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.600]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.420]   Hey, buddy, listen, listen, listen.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.540]   You don't understand, man.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.900]   That is Jesus.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.940]   That is God in the flesh.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.360]   All that stuff you don't wanna sell,
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.100]   it's actually his stuff.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.260]   No, he owns everything.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.620]   The cattle on a thousand hills are his.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.220]   You want to follow him.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.380]   You're talking about eternal life.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.740]   Eternal life is found in him alone.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.580]   You wanna go with him.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.540]   Listen, listen, trust me, trust me.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.380]   Now, there's this book.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.220]   It's in the Bible.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.420]   It's 66 books.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.260]   But I've read it.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.100]   And here's the deal.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.460]   You wanna go.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.700]   No, we don't even know your name.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.740]   We wanna know your name.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.380]   Go with him.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.220]   Go with him.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.260]   What would you tell this guy?
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.420]   No, go all in.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.220]   No, it all doesn't,
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.100]   all that stuff you think that matters, it doesn't matter.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.180]   Go all in with him.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.020]   Hey, tell yourself that.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.840]   Remember that question I asked you on the front end?
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.980]   What's keeping you from going all in?
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.260]   You tell your heart, you speak to your heart right now,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.940]   whatever you would tell this guy.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.420]   No, no, no, no, listen, that relationship,
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.700]   no, no, no, it doesn't matter.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.740]   Pornography, get rid of the computer.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.620]   Anything that's holding you back and go all in.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.220]   Go all in.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:09.940]   And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.900]   how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.780]   It's not about money.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.740]   It's about idols.
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.260]   The disciples were amazed at his words,
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.380]   but Jesus said again, children,
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.980]   how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.620]   It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.540]   than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.820]   He's saying, hey, the kingdom of heaven is impossible
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.920]   for anyone who doesn't think they need it.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.260]   Some of you may have heard that the camel
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.020]   and eye of the needle is a gate to Jerusalem.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.840]   That's stupid.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.860]   There's no historical evidence to support that.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.180]   Dismiss it.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.540]   It's a camel and a needle.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.460]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.340]   He's saying, hey, it's impossible.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.080]   The disciples were even more amazed and said to each other,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.380]   who then can be saved?
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.660]   Jesus looked at them and said,
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.700]   listen, with man this is impossible,
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:58.660]   but not with God.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.580]   All things are possible with God.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.260]   And then Peter spoke up and said, hey, Jesus, listen,
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.500]   we left everything to follow you.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.340]   Do we get in?
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.160]   Like, we're getting in, right?
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.140]   'Cause we left it all.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.620]   And Jesus says, you haven't left anything.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.160]   Oh, you think you've been missing out, huh?
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.740]   Truly I tell you, Jesus replied,
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.660]   no one who has left home or brothers or sisters
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.300]   or mother or father or children or field for me
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.300]   and the gospel will fail to receive 100 times as much
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.140]   in this present age.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.620]   Homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children,
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.500]   and fields along with persecutions.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.240]   And in the age to come, eternal life.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.180]   But many who are first will be last,
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.140]   and the last will be first.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.600]   And so what does it cost you?
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.220]   Everything, what do you gain?
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.940]   So much more.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.100]   My third point is all you gain is everything.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.040]   On this adventure, all that you gain,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.160]   all you have to gain is everything.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.140]   Let me try to make that practical, let me quantify it.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.100]   If you think Christ's followers are missing out,
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.140]   you've missed the point.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.820]   God is not seeking to take an adventure from you,
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.220]   he's seeking to give you one.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.340]   Jesus says, I've come so that they might have life
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.180]   and have it to the full.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.780]   Now, if you don't understand that,
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.820]   you probably grew up in some dead church
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.260]   where you're like, hey, those guys who follow Jesus,
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.120]   I don't wanna be anything like 'em.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.140]   But we'll all kinda put on this dog and pony show
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.860]   and pretend like we know the one true God,
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.580]   and we'll pretend like he gives us joy,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.480]   but really we're all miserable inside.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.260]   All right?
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.460]   And that's not Christianity,
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.180]   and that's not what I'm talking about.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.580]   Jesus is calling you to an adventure,
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.860]   and the adventure starts now.
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.720]   And what does it start with?
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.560]   Listen closely.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.700]   It starts with belief.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.980]   Your actions will follow your belief.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.500]   If you believe in God,
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.560]   then you know you are not missing out.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.980]   And what you believed here,
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.540]   not what you did here,
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.840]   will determine your eternity.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.020]   Do you really believe that Jesus is the Son of God,
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.500]   and that God defeated death through him,
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.180]   that God has forgiven our sins through him?
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.900]   Because heaven and hell are both real outcomes
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.500]   of your belief here on earth.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.700]   You have real eternal outcomes.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.700]   You will really be somewhere someday,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.780]   forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:15.460]   Your belief here will determine your adventure here
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.160]   and your reward there.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.000]   Did you hear that?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.620]   Your belief here will determine your adventure here
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.700]   and your reward there.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.340]   Jesus says 100 times as much.
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.820]   C.S. Lewis said it like this.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.060]   The only thing you will own in heaven
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.960]   will be things you gave away here.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.020]   Wow.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.020]   The only things you'll possess in heaven
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.620]   are the things that you had given away
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.020]   while you were on earth.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.060]   Guys, listen, man.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.860]   Imagine how much fun, and I said fun,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.420]   this guy could have had.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.540]   Jesus, they're talking, hey, here's what I want you to do.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.780]   I want you to go and sell everything you have
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.780]   and give it to the poor and then follow me.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.700]   We believe that.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.580]   We hear that and we're like, dude,
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.980]   why couldn't he have just been like Peter
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.580]   and throw down your nets?
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.900]   Or one of the other apostles, rather,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.540]   just, hey, throw down your nets and follow me, right?
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.180]   I mean, he's gotta sell everything.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.740]   Like, he's gotta go on eBay and Craigslist.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.580]   Okay, here's the deal.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.120]   It's all up for sale, state sale, you know.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.420]   How much fun would this have been?
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.820]   This is like my dream day.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.940]   Craigslist, eBay, like, okay, here's the deal.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.340]   I'm gonna liquidate all of this stuff.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.420]   I'm gonna take this money.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.260]   Oh, you want some?
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.100]   Here you go.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:19.920]   Oh, you want some?
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.760]   Okay, here you go.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.580]   Let me make your day, too.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.740]   Oh, you can't afford that car payment?
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.580]   I just bought your car.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.420]   It's your car now.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.240]   There you go.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.080]   Oh, you're behind on your house?
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:26.980]   No, it's your house.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.220]   I just purchased it from the bank.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.180]   Take it.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.180]   How much fun would that,
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.860]   have you guys ever been generous like that?
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.260]   Like, that is a lot of fun.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.900]   It is really, really fun.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.020]   And like, 'cause it's all Jesus's.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.660]   So he's like, "Hey, Jesus, I sold everything.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.500]   "I gave it to the poor."
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.540]   It's really fun.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.380]   Okay, now where are we going?
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.220]   Let's go, man.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.040]   Let's rock.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.880]   Where are we going, Bali?
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.700]   What?
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.540]   Where are we going?
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.380]   Where are we going, Jerusalem?
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.200]   Okay.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.040]   Across?
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.880]   Oh, man, that doesn't sound fun.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.700]   So what's next, if you read on?
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.180]   Jesus isn't asking you anything that he didn't do.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.780]   He not give everything?
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.360]   He gave everything.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.660]   Gave it all.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.740]   For you, because he loves you.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.220]   The greatest act of the law of the world is ever known.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.020]   And instead, this guy returned to keeping the rules
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.020]   and counting his money.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:14.980]   He was a slave.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.260]   He wasn't free, he was a slave.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.300]   He was a slave like some of us are slaves.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.820]   See, what you can't give away, you don't own.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.660]   It owns you.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.740]   You're its slave.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:30.040]   What you cannot give away, you do not own.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.820]   It owns you.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.620]   But whatever you give up for Christ, you will gain more.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.620]   I'm not saying that if you give a dollar, you get 100.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.300]   You might gain a correct understanding of money
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.580]   and no longer need the dollar.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.560]   You might get 100.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.260]   I don't know how God's going to do that,
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.920]   but I see here that whatever you give, you gain more.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.040]   Not in a prosperity gospel kind of way,
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.280]   but you will be blessed.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.260]   I know people who have been blessed.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.500]   And this adventure that we're talking about,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.740]   I love what Jim Elliot says.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.820]   He says, "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.420]   "for that which he cannot lose."
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.060]   He is no fool who gives that which he cannot keep
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.140]   for that which he cannot lose.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.500]   And this adventure that we're talking about,
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.340]   it starts right now.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.900]   It's not heaven.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.000]   Heaven's the after party.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.440]   The adventure, it starts right here in Dallas,
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.340]   right there in Fort Worth.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.300]   Heaven's the after party, man.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.100]   That's where we get to go and celebrate
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.500]   the adventure that we had down here.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.700]   Do you guys know what today is?
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.140]   Fat Tuesday, if you didn't know.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.880]   And do you guys know what Fat Tuesday is?
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.180]   A lot of us, it's just like, well,
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.380]   it's just a day to get drunk and--
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.220]   - Get Mardi Gras.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.420]   - Get these Mardi Gras.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.500]   It is Mardi Gras.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   But do we know even what that is?
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.340]   Check this out.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.260]   Why is it called Fat Tuesday?
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.460]   Let me tell you.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.380]   Fat Tuesday, it has religious implications, actually.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.420]   Fat Tuesday is the day before Ash Wednesday.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.020]   Ash Wednesday is the day that starts Lent.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.500]   Lent is fasting.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.860]   So what do we do on Fat Tuesday?
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.740]   We gorge ourselves on good food
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.900]   so that then we can fast through Lent.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.180]   That's where this comes from.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.620]   And it's turned into debauchery, right?
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.900]   We turn it into Lower Greenville, Uptown.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.260]   We're like, hey, we go and we get wasted.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:16.120]   And we have girls trade their dignity for 50-cent beads.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.900]   That's what we do on Fat Tuesday.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.540]   But it's interesting.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.740]   This is the origination of this is that we would go,
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.820]   and because we're gonna have to give something up for God,
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.700]   we go and we are gluttons.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:36.220]   And I think some of you view Christianity this way.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:40.180]   Hey, I'm gonna get right with Jesus one day,
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.740]   but right now I'm gonna have all the fun that I can
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.480]   before I go there, and you're missing out on real fun.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.140]   And before you start to think, oh yeah, sure, Pastor Boyd,
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.980]   'cause maybe you're a guest, you don't know.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.680]   You don't know, man.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.020]   Like whatever you think fun is, I've done it on steroids.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.780]   All right, cocaine, yeah, you got it.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   Ecstasy, you got it.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.580]   The bar scene, you got it.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.560]   Club scene was the ruler of it.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.620]   The rich young ruler.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.600]   Girls, oh yeah.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.200]   The cars, you got it.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.460]   The bikes, yes, sir.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.900]   Penthouse condo, yes, sir, check.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.060]   And so whatever you think, no, this is where life is.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.460]   I'm telling you from experience.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.260]   As someone who has found the one true God,
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.460]   he found me actually, changed my life.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.740]   You're missing out.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.340]   I'm sad for you.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:34.700]   In fact, this weekend, we just moved,
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.140]   and so we have a bunch of boxes in our garage,
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.420]   and I was looking for something.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.900]   I was actually looking for a motorcycle helmet
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.780]   and a shipwreck coin, but that's an illustration
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.880]   for another day, and what I found was a box of pictures,
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.620]   photographs, and so I opened the box,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.960]   and I began to go through them,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.140]   and a lot of Monica and I, when we were dating,
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.220]   it was Valentine's Day, so I was like,
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.540]   you know, this will be fun, we'll go,
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.020]   and we'll look at these pictures for Valentine's Day,
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.180]   but there was a stack of pictures, and I pulled it out,
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.020]   and you know what it was?
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.340]   It was Mardi Gras in New Orleans.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.080]   See, I went big.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.260]   And I was looking through them, and I was deeply grieved.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.820]   I saw the look on my face, the glary stare,
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.860]   the drunkenness.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.700]   I mean, as I went through it, I mean, it was pornography,
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.620]   is what it was, pornography that I participated in.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.540]   And it was the party, and there I am,
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.780]   holding a hurricane in one hand,
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.660]   arm around a girl in another hand,
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.300]   you know, kind of a smile in the camera,
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.740]   and what's crazy, man, I remember that trip.
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.100]   I mean, I remember some of that trip,
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.900]   and I remember going up to the trip.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.380]   I remember how excited we were for that trip.
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.820]   I remember after that trip, the stories we told.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.700]   Remember, dude, you threw up, you threw up
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.260]   all over your pants, and then you wore them the next day,
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.140]   and it was like, that was fun?
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.580]   When you wore up the pants with throw up on 'em?
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.740]   Like, really?
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.900]   That's the story, that's what we walked away from.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.740]   Like, that's our trophy.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.620]   Remember the pants and the throw up, it was so gross, ha ha.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.180]   Man, it sounds gross.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.820]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.340]   Do you see what the enemy does, how he tricks you?
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.660]   Sin robs you of creativity, you're doing the same thing.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.340]   It's like, this is life.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.020]   50 cent beads for my dignity, life.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:30.820]   And God says, no, man, can I give you life?
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:36.860]   Trusted Christ, and became a Christian,
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.220]   and within two years was in the jungles of Africa,
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.860]   teaching the government, conflict reconciliation,
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.660]   and shortly thereafter was on a boat
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.380]   traveling through the Amazon jungle
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.740]   for days to get off in the villages and play soccer,
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.140]   and give hope to orphans.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.180]   You talk about laughing 'til you cry.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.820]   Shortly thereafter, when the earthquake hit Haiti,
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.460]   we went, met with organizations,
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.220]   and talked about how we can change a nation.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.900]   All of a sudden, I felt like I was being used by God.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.900]   I felt alive, had lots of fun, and came back to Dallas.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:21.860]   Last year, we were able to give financially, generously,
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.460]   more than I've made in years past.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.860]   And I don't say that to brag.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.720]   And I don't say that because we have a lot of money,
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.700]   we don't, except for we're in America, and we all do.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.780]   But we don't have a lot of money.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.060]   I say that because our view of money changed,
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.740]   and I realize it's all God's.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.740]   If I would run an account on the times
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.300]   that I've laughed the hardest,
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.260]   it wasn't on the back, it's not on the back of tailgates
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:52.140]   with Bud Lights in my hand, and I've laughed there.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.460]   But the times I've laughed the hardest
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.180]   have been around fire pits with other brothers and sisters,
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.460]   reflecting on the goodness of God.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.260]   In fact, top 10 times would be celebrating life
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.600]   with other followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.300]   I've done things, I've got lots of regrets,
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:13.060]   but I found life in Jesus and in following him.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.900]   And I tell you that because I know some of you
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.300]   are halfway in, which means you're not in at all.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.780]   And he's calling you, he's looking you in the eyes right now
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.260]   and he has a real personal invitation to you,
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.380]   and you say, hey, I want you to come and follow me.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.280]   And I'm telling you, both experientially
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.560]   and from the scriptures, from a God who loves you,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:36.280]   that there's life there, life is found in Jesus alone.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.920]   In summary, your personal effort is not your passport.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.900]   All you need is need, and all you gain is everything.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.160]   Garrett sent me this email.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.560]   It was 'cause we were dialoguing about his trip.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.740]   And it was real interesting what he said.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.900]   He said, you know the best parts,
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.460]   and this will sound cliche, but he says,
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.260]   the best parts weren't the surfing,
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:08.860]   weren't the skydiving or the BMXing through the jungle.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.700]   Like, the best parts were sharing the gospel with people.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.600]   Just going through and talking about Jesus.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.540]   And I said, well, what do you mean?
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.900]   And so he shot me this email and he said,
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.500]   just imagine this, when we were in Bali,
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.180]   we really wanted to surf Bali,
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.180]   because the surfing there is extraordinary.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.620]   And so we were gonna go and we had a driver,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.020]   we had hired a driver there,
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.340]   and he had already taken two guys right before us.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.540]   And so he came back to pick up Brian and I,
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.180]   this is Garrett saying this.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.460]   And so I'm leaning forward, I'm listening.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.020]   And he says, JP, imagine this, we're driving down the road,
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.780]   the sun is shining, got my flip flops on
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.620]   and my swimming trunks and my tank top,
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.700]   and there's jungle on both sides.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.100]   And we're driving along a white sandy beach,
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.540]   there's crystal blue water where we're about to surf.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.940]   And our driver, we began to talk to him
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.420]   and we began to share the gospel to him.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.780]   And he stops, he cuts us off and he says,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.060]   oh man, the two guys before you
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.580]   have already told me about your God.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.460]   But then we continued the conversation for 20 minutes.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.380]   We talked about how Jesus is the only way,
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.540]   that there is no other way.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.140]   We talked about how the Bible is different
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.660]   from other religious books.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.260]   We talked about how much God loved him,
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.340]   that he gave his only son in Jesus Christ,
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.340]   that 2015 years ago, in an event that every atheist
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.980]   on the face of the planet acknowledges
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.220]   by the date they put on their checks,
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.180]   God became a man in the form of Jesus Christ.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.660]   And then in the midst of that,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.620]   in the 20 minutes of us talking Jesus with him,
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.380]   he took a phone call and Garrett said,
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.820]   he was riding shotgun, I turned back to Brian
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.340]   and I said, you know what?
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:36.940]   This is better than surfing, better than skydiving,
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.520]   better than anything we could experience here.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.080]   To which Brian says, man, you're totally right.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.920]   And Garrett doesn't need to go to Bali
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.120]   to live the adventure.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.120]   I know, because I'm doing life with him,
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.760]   that Garrett's living the adventure
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.360]   right there in Fort Worth today.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.400]   That those guys are on the adventure,
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.720]   they're all in with Jesus.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.620]   They've lost their life for his sake.
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.320]   They hold it loosely, they've leveraged everything
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.520]   for the sake of the kingdom, so that one day
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.080]   they can enjoy all of those things forever and ever
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.120]   and ever and ever.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.600]   And to some of you, that's just impractical.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.400]   And we want to help you make that practical.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.960]   We'd love to meet with you and pray with you
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.640]   and talk with you and see you go all in.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.120]   I've stumbled into a church,
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.840]   I sat in the back row hungover,
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.500]   when I trusted in Jesus and I saw him devour my life
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.720]   and I want the same thing for you if he hasn't.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.920]   Because here's the deal.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.640]   We talked about heaven and hell.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.840]   I wanna tell you about it.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.960]   Do you know that there's no missing out in heaven?
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.440]   Heaven is the fullness of God,
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.600]   there's no missing out there.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.140]   There's no FOMO in heaven.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.480]   There's no FOMO.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.440]   Do you know what hell is?
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.320]   Hell is eternal FOMO.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.220]   Hell is being somewhere with the full realization
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.920]   of everything that you could have had
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.280]   that was freely available to you,
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.360]   that when Jesus said, "Follow me," you said, "No."
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:04.980]   And therefore you experience missing out
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.980]   for the rest of the rest of the rest.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.940]   And I'm telling you that in heaven,
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.820]   you will not regret anything you gave up
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.540]   for the sake of the kingdom there.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   There will not be a single FOMO experience in heaven,
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.520]   a single regret experience in the kingdom.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.620]   God said, "Hey, you go all in with me."
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.460]   I'm gonna pray now that you would.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.540]   Lord, help us.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.820]   Father, help us to realize that Jesus is better,
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.480]   that whatever we would hold on to here,
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.660]   that Christ is better.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.260]   Better than riches or gold,
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:50.140]   better than pornography or trinkets that we might collect,
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.720]   better than watches, better than bags and purses,
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:00.580]   better than shoes and anything that we might collect
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.840]   on this planet, that it would be like sand in your kingdom,
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   like asphalt.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.660]   And Father, I pray that you would strip our lives
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.040]   of everything that distracts us from you,
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.600]   which is such a scary prayer.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:18.480]   As we sing this song, Lord, I pray that each of my friends
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.840]   would plead with you, strip our lives of everything
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.640]   that comes between you and us.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   And Father, we praise, we want to declare,
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.920]   Jesus is better.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.820]   It is in his name.
