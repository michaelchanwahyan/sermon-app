[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Good evening and welcome to the porch.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of relationships.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Can we cue some music please?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   From our friendships to our romantic endeavors, we'll explore our family bonds,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   estranged relationships, work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So how do we relate?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   To answer this, we'll look to scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our relationships.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This is, after all, the Relationship Series.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Alright, Porch, how we doing? We doing okay?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Great to see ya. Welcome back to the Relationship Series.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   So glad that you would choose to be with us.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Not just those of you that are here in the room, but especially those of you that are here online with us.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   A special shout out to Porch Live Dayton, Porch Live Indianapolis, and Porch Live Scottsdale.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We're so grateful that y'all will be a part of what's happening here at the porch.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I've got some very special friends with me here tonight.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And we've got a very special evening prepared for you.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   But first what I want to do is I want to introduce my friends here to my left.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   This is Kaitlyn Van Wagner and this is John Cox.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Everybody say hello.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Yeah. Okay.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   So here's what we're doing tonight.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   We are continuing in our series, the Relationship Series, where we're talking about God's design for connecting to one another.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And what we did a couple of weeks ago is we basically walked through a theology of work.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Which is important because if you consider the average adult life, roughly a third of your life is going to be committed to the office space.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I did the math.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And it's going to be roughly 30% of your life.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Your waking hours are going to be spent on the job.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And so knowing that that's the truth, we thought we would bring in some very special authorities on the topic of work.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Here's what would be helpful before we just get things rolling.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Kaitlyn, John, would you all just do a quick introduction of yourself, what your role is here at Watermark, and a brief bio on your work experience.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Awesome.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hey, y'all.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   My name is Kaitlyn Van Wagner.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I get to serve as the Senior Director of Communications here at Watermark.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Before I took a hard left turn into ministry, I was in the corporate world.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So I was a branding strategist at an ad agency here in Dallas for several years before I came to work here at Watermark.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And I'm John Cox, and I'm the Executive Pastor here at Watermark.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And I have spent about half my life in ministry and about half in business.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And so Stanford undergrad, did ministry for a while, went back and got an MBA from Harvard, moved to Dallas.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Did you hear that?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Oh, no. Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He was like, should I share that?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I went to Texas A&M.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   [CHEERS]
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   See, Aggies get the whoop.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yeah, much better.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You get the--
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Much better.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, we're fear of the tree.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   That's what this--
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Stanford is.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So after I got my MBA, I moved to Dallas.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And so I had grown up as a Navy kid, never lived in the middle of the US, but moved to Dallas,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   went to work for a strategy consulting company called the Boston Consulting Group.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Worked for them for about five years, then went to a hedge fund in town,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   which they had a strategy just for HBK Investments, and did that for about five years before I came on staff.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And so been on staff for about the last 14 years, minus a three-year break back in investments.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   That's awesome.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Listen, I don't know what your work situation is, but we got you covered here tonight.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I hope you brought a big pad, because you're going to want to take some notes.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   They were unpacking for me very briefly some of the things that they were wanting to share this evening,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and I was like, where's my journal?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Like, I need to take some of this down for myself, because they truly have an experience that's going to be really beneficial to you.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Here's why we're doing this.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We know that work is a big part of your life.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   But we also know that the truth of God's word is not just meant to be intellectualized.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's meant to be practically executed.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You're supposed to take the knowledge in your mind, and you're supposed to live it into existence.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And so we wanted to give you some really good handles to hold as you consider your work experience,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   as you consider what your professional endeavors are today, tomorrow, and then into the future.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And so we polled the porch public, and we asked you guys, hey, what are your questions?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And so we've taken those, and we've synthesized them, and we've prepared some questions for John and Caitlin to walk us through.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   The first one I think is really appropriate, because so much of the topic around professionalism is connected to purpose.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   A lot of people look to their job, and they want to find purpose or fulfillment within it.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   They want to do that.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   They want to find whatever it is their passion, and they want to pursue that in their career.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And so the first thing that I want to ask you guys is just how can we be faithful in our jobs when it doesn't feel purposeful,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   or we're not necessarily passionate about it?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   What would you all say?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Absolutely.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I would say the first thing I would say is faithfulness isn't dependent on your circumstances,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   including what job you have or how passionate you are about that job.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I think obviously there is a desire to be passionate.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   That's an ideal we want to ascribe to, but that's not always the case.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   In fact, there is a lot to be said about working at a job that you might not necessarily be passionate about.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You can learn a lot from being placed in a job that you might not be as well suited for or maybe not passionate about.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   You can learn what you're not good at.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   There is a lot to be learned, and really smart people know how to redeem every single experience in their life
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   for essentially creating a greater work acumen, a greater work resume.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So you don't necessarily have to be working in your -- especially right out of college.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I think there's a myth that you'll find your dream job, and until I find my dream job, I'm going to keep job hopping.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   There can be a lot to be said by staying and being faithful where you have been placed to make an impact wherever you're at.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   That is a news flash.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I worked in college ministry for a long time, and then I jumped into young adult ministry shortly thereafter, and it's true.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Some of you would nod your heads in agreement that your hope coming out of your undergraduate degree or grad school
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   was to find that thing that I'm burning up with unbridled passion for, and let me leverage all of my life to it.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And that's just not the way it goes.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I think Kaitlin is speaking to something really important.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I also think if you're expecting your job to fulfill your purpose, you're expecting your job to fill a role it was never meant to do,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   which it cannot fulfill.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Only Christ can give you your purpose.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   So if you are waiting for your job to feel filled with purpose, you're going to be waiting forever because it just isn't going to happen.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Your purpose should come from Christ, and don't put your job in a position to fill a role it's not ever going to fill.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Yeah, I think one other thing is, you know, when you think about jobs, you think about where you're going to work,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and then you think about how you're going to work, right?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And the Lord is much more concerned with how you work than where you work.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And so lots of people get wrapped around the axle, "Am I in the right place?"
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And the question you should be asking is, "Hey, how am I doing my job?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Am I doing it with faithfulness?"
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You know, in the book of Colossians, it just says, "Whatever you do, work it out with all your heart.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's working for the Lord, not for men, because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It is the Lord Christ you're serving."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And he's much more concerned with how we're working in the job that we're in.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And any job is not perfect, right?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And so at Watermark, I often say to myself, "Hey, when the days are really hard, I'm getting paid double.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Those days I'm getting paid double.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And the days that are easy, I'm working for free."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And it generally balances out, you know?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So that's just what I'm telling myself.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I'm working--I'm getting paid double today.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   That's really good.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Some of you needed to hear that.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   You're like, "I'm getting paid double for this one."
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah, you know, I think the both of you just alluded to something that I think is really important.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And we've actually--we've said this from the stage before, but I know this is probably true for you all.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I know as I've visited with young adults, often what I hear is, "Man, I'm just--I'm not getting life from my job."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But here's the newsflash.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Your job was never meant to give you life.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Like, it was never intended to accomplish that end.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   No, it is a part of what God has called you to do here in this world as you walk with him.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   But the only one that gives life is Jesus Christ.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   In him is life and life to the full.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   That's where you'll find it.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And so I think it's really important that that's known here from the outset.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   One thing that I was looking at, which I thought this was fascinating.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I don't know what you all think about this.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Recently, Gallup, they did a study, and it showed that 30% of Americans are disengaged.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Excuse me, only 30% of Americans are actively engaged on the job.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Which would mean that 70% are somewhere underneath active engagement, trending towards disengagement.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   This is the lowest level of engagement recorded in the last decade.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Which is fascinating when you consider that many of us are pursuing jobs according to our passions.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   It means that your passion is actually not leading to fulfillment.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   It means that you're pursuing that which is going to make me feel amazing in life.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Like, I'm going to choose the job I love, and I'll never work a day in my life.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And yet what's happened is you're actively disengaged, though you have pursued your passions.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And it's because that's not meant to give you life.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It's not meant to engage you.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I thought this was also very interesting, and I'll just have you all speak to it.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Because I'm curious.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   The main reasons why people are disengaged on the job are -- the main three categories were remote employees,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   those that are in hybrid work situations, and young adults under 35.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   So, John, you and I were talking about this earlier.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Because there's a lot that's heaped up in this idea of, like, I'm supposed to pursue my passion.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And yet we were talking about, well, there's a difference between pursuing a job according to my passion
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   and pursuing a job according to my gifts.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Would you mind speaking to that?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Yeah, so I think any time you're looking at a job, you're looking at four factors.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   The first one is, where do I want to work, like, geographically?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Where do I want to live?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   The second one is a specific industry.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Are you passionate about oil and gas or consumer retail or medicine?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And the third one is really, what are you doing every day?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Like, when you show up at 8 o'clock, what are the tasks you're doing?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And do they fit with how God has wired you?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And then the last one is the culture.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Like, do I like the people I work with?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And what I see consistently is the younger you are, the more likely you are to emphasize,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   where do I want to live and what industry would I want to work in?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And the truth is, is what most impacts your satisfaction on your job is,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   what am I doing every day?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And am I good at those things?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And then correspondingly, am I working with people that I genuinely enjoy being around?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And so, you know, the thing about me is that I never had a 40-year vision for what I was supposed to do.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Like, one of the greatest lies is that if I only find the right job,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   then everything is going to fall into place.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And what I would say is, is if you asked me ever since I was 21 years old
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   where I was going to be in five years, okay, I would now be wrong 39 consecutive years, right?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Predicting where you're going to be or finding the perfect job is just an illusion.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And so, what I've learned is, is hey, when you're in a job, right,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   what you want to do is get into a spot where you're using the things that God has gifted you to do
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   and surround yourself with people that you genuinely like seeing, right?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Like, that's important.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And then you've got to understand that life is difficult, okay?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Because if you don't understand life is difficult, what happens is the first time you have a setback
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   or there's some dissatisfaction with a job, okay, you begin to think something's wrong.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   And if on the other hand, you just go, hey, life is difficult, right, that's normal, okay?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Then you don't get unsettled when, you know, when things aren't working out exactly the way you want them to.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   - I think that's such a--we've talked about this before, John.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   There's freedom in--I'm the same way. I've never had a five-year plan for my life.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I've always just gone, hey, what's God have for me in the next season of my life?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And there's a lot of freedom in that.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   You don't have to put pressure on yourself to know where you're going to be in five years
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   to make all these things line up to make sure you're knocking them down in a row.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And so, it's like you can take a minute to breathe.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I think some people do get calls on their life and they have a vision of like, you know,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I'm not going to be--I know I'm not going to be a doctor in five years.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   That's for sure. I know I'm not going to be--but some people have that.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   But like you can also give yourself some room to exhale to go, what would God have for me?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And I want to be faithful with what opportunities he's bringing me today for this next season.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   - Okay. So, y'all both alluded to I want to excel at what's revealed.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Like where God has me today is where God wants me today.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It matters less what I do and it matters more how I do it.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   People are really familiar with the idea of someone being called to ministry.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Is it possible to be called to a career, to a specific job?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And how do you make sense of that? What would y'all say to that?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   - Yeah, I think I would say, does that happen? Yes. Okay.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But I think a much more likely path is that it is a process of investigation.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And I think really in your 20s, one of your main goals is to try and figure out,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   what am I good at and how can I deploy that? Right?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Because I think that when you think about work, you're thinking about,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   you want to go to a place where you add value. Okay?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   That's much easier to do if you are naturally good at it.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Second, you want to go to a place where you can impact people.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Because at the end of the day, it's all about relationships. Okay?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And then the third thing that you want to do as you're thinking about that kind of stuff
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   is how am I developing my gifts today so that I can be even more valuable tomorrow?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Right? What am I doing to develop myself?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And so that's how I think about if I'm doing those three things,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   then I'm moving in the right direction.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I tell people all the time, your 20s are for learning.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Everybody's expecting to arrive in their 20s.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And it's just not the way it works.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I talk to so many young adults right out of college
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   who genuinely just don't know what they're good at.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And that's okay. That's an okay place to be,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   to not know exactly what your gift sets are.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   There's tons of assessments you can take to help you figure that out.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   But honestly, that's why it can be useful doing jobs that you don't like
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   because you learn that you are not good at things.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And that's just as valuable. Right?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So also give yourself a little bit of grace.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   If you don't quite know what you're good at,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   just keep going and trying and asking for different types of projects
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   on the work that you're on.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Hey, try to flex some new muscles.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   You fail at it, we maybe go in a different direction. Right?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So give yourself a little bit of grace.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So how do we learn what we're good at?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   How do we discern what our God-given gifting is?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I think about it in two categories.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I think about drains and gains.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   So what are some of the tasks that when I'm doing them,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   they give me energy.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Like, I love, if you hang around me,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   my favorite place in the entire world to be is at a whiteboard.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Like, it is my comfort animal, is a whiteboard.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And I love any task. And it gives me energy.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I get like a weird little buzz when I'm whiteboarding or problem solving
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   or that sort of thing.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And it's like, if you put me in front of an Excel document, my soul dies.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And so, and like, but that's taking--
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   So you're like, amen.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Yes, the lights go out.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Preach.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And but I think just having a sense for what is giving you naturally energy
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   when you're doing those tasks and what seems to be draining energy from you.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Sometimes you still have to do those tasks.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Because sometimes being faithful means I still have to do Excel.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   I still have to do my budget every single year.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And so you have to do some of those.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   But where are you naturally gaining energy and getting energy drained from you?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And then honestly, ask people around you.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Like, your parents probably have a good sense,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   might have a good sense of what you're good at and what you're not good at.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Ask trusted people around you.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Where do I seem to excel?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Where do I seem to not seem to naturally be a skilled?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Yeah, yeah, I think feedback is great.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Because sometimes it's hard to see in yourself.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And so what I would say is it's not always obvious.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   So you've got to try a lot of things. Right?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And it's practice where you begin to find that groove.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And you just need to be patient with yourself.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   If you don't know, that's okay. Right?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I was 35 years old before I began to figure out what I was really good at.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   I think that there's two things that I always point people towards.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   John, you just took one. And Kaitlyn, you took the other.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   We didn't even plan it.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   But I'll put it in alliteration for you.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Feedback from others and its fruitfulness in my labor.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   That's how you discern if I'm gifted.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   From the Lord for a specific task.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   You see the Apostle Paul, when he's appointing Timothy to the work of pastoring the church at Ephesus,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   they lay hands upon Timothy.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   They affirm him that he is gifted for the work of pastoring there.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   There's feedback. Good feedback that you're gifted for this.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   We've all watched American Idol.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And we've seen people betrayed by a lack of honest feedback.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   That's not your gifting.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Don't go on the show. Don't sing in front of those judges.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Some of you need some honest feedback in your life.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   You need people to help you learn what am I actually gifted and good for.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And you also need to discern where's the fruit in my life.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Like if God's given me a gift for it,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   then the nature of God is that the things that he applies his hands to, they burst in life.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And so as you apply your hands through God's gifted provision,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   they'll burst forth in life as well.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And he will do so for his glory and for the good of other people.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Now, let's turn a corner because y'all have both kind of spoken to this,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   which I think is important.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   How do we know when it's time to search for another job?
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Because I think there's something good that y'all have pushed on,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   and it may be worth pushing a little bit more.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Like hey, just because it's hard doesn't mean you get out.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And so I want us to speak to that.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   But at the same time, we do need to be discerning of when it's time to move
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   and transition into a new job or a new career or something along those lines.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   So what would y'all say to that?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   I think I could speak to the pushing through.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   I think for me, impact has often come to me through longevity.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And so when somebody comes onto my team, and it was the same for me in the marketplace
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   as it was in ministry, I say the same -- we give them the same speech on day one.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   You are not going to know how to do your job for a solid year.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   It takes a solid year to understand how to do a job.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   For me, my pattern has been in both places.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It takes a year for me to learn how to do a job.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It takes another year for me to get semi-good at it.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And then the third year is where it gets really fun,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   because I've built up the relational and professional equity
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   where I can start to make an impact on the organization.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So there is something to be said for longevity.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   When I worked in advertising, it was pretty known that the quickest way to get a pay bump
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   was you jumped agencies every 18 months.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And that could make sense, and there are times when you would want to job hop like that
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   if you have bad workplaces or things like that.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But man, it got really good at like year three,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   and that's when I started to make an impact and see --
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and that's when I started to find even more purpose in my work,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   because I was seeing the fruit of that.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So there is something to be said for longevity.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Yeah, and I think about it a lot like I think about dating.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   So taking a job is not like getting married.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   You are not stuck there for the rest of your life.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   On the other hand, taking a job is not like a first date.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   So somewhere between I'm going to switch jobs every three months
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and I'm never switching jobs is probably the right path.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   So I've been in six different companies over the course of my career.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And one of the things is there are lots of times I've been in jobs where I'm frustrated
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   or where I feel like it's painful in certain parts of my job.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And as a general rule for me, right, when I'm thinking about taking another job,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   what I want to do is you don't want to move away from things.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   You want to move toward things, right?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So if you're in a job that is frustrating, right,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   the wrong thing to do is leave a job because it's frustrating.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   The right thing to do is to begin to get your antenna up,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   see if the frustration is lasting, and think about what can I move toward.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Right, so you move toward things, not away from things.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And so what have I learned here?
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And now knowing that, what do I want to move towards next?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   What about if it's a toxic or abusive work environment?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Well, then you start to think about you're starting to pay a cost, right?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And so I think that's where, especially as Christ followers,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   your faith becomes really important for how you work through that level of conflict
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   in order to, if you're going to leave, something like that,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   my charge to you would be like, how can you leave well?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   How can you leave honestly?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   How can you leave with your integrity intact, not having gossiped
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   or burned the place down on your way out, right?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   So what does that look like?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So I do think that that could be a reason to leave.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   My charge to you in that would be, how do you leave well?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   That's really good, yeah.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I think that toxic work environment is thrown around a lot in our generation.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And what we need to do is we need to qualify what we mean by toxic.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Just because it's difficult, just because it's hard,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   just because it's uncomfortable doesn't necessarily equate with toxicity.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   So just think about it like this.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   A toxic work environment will feel something like a toxic physical environment.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   What would be true of a toxic physical environment?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   It would promote danger to your physical and mental, emotional, spiritual well-being.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Recently I was out walking.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   There's a trail that goes behind where Brooke and I live,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and there was an armadillo rummaging in the brush right off to the side of the path.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   That's a really safe environment for that guy to be in.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   What's not a safe environment for him to be in,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   and is extremely toxic to his survival, is the road.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   That would not be a good place for him to be. Why?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Because he is in danger. It is a deadly place for him to be.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   If you find that your physical or emotional well-being is taking shots,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   I think the first thing you must do is you have to consider counsel.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   There's safety in a multitude of counsel.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   You talk to people and you evaluate your state of affairs.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   But then you also reckon with the reality that you don't just pull the ripcord
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   and eject out of that situation.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   You be prayerful. You consider, "Is God calling me to leave?"
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   1 Peter 2, 18-19, it says,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   "Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   not only to the good and the gentle, but also to the unjust.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   For this is a gracious thing.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   When mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly."
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And he gives the reason for it.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Peter says in verse 21, "For to this you've been called,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   because Christ also suffered for you,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   When he suffered, he did not threaten,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   but he continued entrusting himself to the one who judges justly."
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   What you see there is Jesus was willing to be persevering
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   in the face of injustice.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And he finished really well, to Caitlin's point.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   - Yeah, and let me address just like work-life balance.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   - That seems to be a huge topic these days.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And what I would say is, I think when you are in your 20s,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   that's really where you're figuring out what you're good at
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   and you're becoming highly confident at your job.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And if you want to be great at work,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   you can't be great at like a dozen things, right?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   You can be great at a couple.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And so one of the decisions each of us has got to decide is,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   what are those things that you want to be great at?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And then I'm going to prioritize that.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   So for me, for much of my work career, it was my walk with Jesus.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   That was first.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Then second was being a husband and father.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And the third was being very good at what I worked at, okay?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   So if it touched one of those things, it was priority A.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Everything else was optional.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And so what that meant was is, you know,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I'm not a single-digit handicapper at golf, right?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   I'm not a nationally ranked pickleball player, okay?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   There's lots of things I'm not because one of the ways to be good at something
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   is to do less of other things, right?
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And so being great at it is taking stuff off the plate.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Now, having said that, what I would say is,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   look, anybody in a job can sprint like 100 yards.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   No one can sprint 60 miles, okay?
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And so there are jobs where you're asked to go sprint 100 yards or 200 yards.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   That's okay, okay?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   There are other jobs where you're sprinting 60 miles, okay?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I had a job one time where over a three-month period,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   on Mondays and Tuesdays, I was in London, England, okay?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Wednesdays and Thursdays, I was in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And Fridays, I was in charge of the recruiting
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   for the consulting company I was at,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   so I was all over the business schools in the country, okay?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Now, that's something you can do for a little while.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   That is not a sustainable life, okay?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And so there was a point at which it's like, look,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   what's very clear to me is that it is making demands
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   that that's not how I want to live the rest of my life.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And so when we got pregnant with our second child,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I'm like, okay, in eight months, I'm going to be doing something else
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   because I just can't sprint like that.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Okay, but John, like, I've got goals.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Like, I have ambitions.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I have certain marks I need to hit.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   I've got a difference I want to make in the world.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I've got to leave an impact with this short life that I have.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   What does it look like to trust the Lord
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   while still being ambitious in my career?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I think ambition in and of itself is not a bad thing.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   When you make ambition your identity,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   you are setting yourself up to be disappointed.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   So from my perspective, my story is I, when I,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I made ambition my idol in my 20s.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Like, advertising girl was my whole personality,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   and it was not a good look.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And I just chased that for, and I was one of those people
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   that did self-imposed 80-, 90-hour work weeks,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and everything about me was my job.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I placed my entire identity in my achievement and my performance.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And the issue is, is that is a moving target,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   and that target never stops moving.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And for me, I chased that and chased it and chased it.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And then the cost was that my health eventually came out.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   So I gave out.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   So I had a two-year-long health battle
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   because I had worked myself so, so hard.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And I had to rebuild not just my body but my identity.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And man, I'm so grateful for the gospel
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that says that we don't have to earn anything.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   He earned it all for us because, man, I was an earner
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and not used to that message.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So I would say ambition, in and of itself,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   is not a bad thing.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I mean, the Proverbs are filled with Scripture about diligence.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And so, "In excellence we think honors God and inspires men."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And so I would say there's nothing wrong with ambition,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   but if ambition is your idol, if it is your only motivation,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   you are setting yourself up to be disappointed.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   It makes a really bad master.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   - Yeah. - That's awesome.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   - Yeah, or if your value really comes from what you do.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Like, I've lived around the US in a lot of different cities,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and different cities value different things, okay?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So when I lived in Washington, D.C.,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   the very first question people wanted to ask you
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   was, "Who do you work for?"
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Okay?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Because that is a city that is all about the power.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And it's like, "Do you work for somebody who's somebody?"
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Right?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And then, you know, I lived in Boston.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And in Boston, they care a lot about where you went to school.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Right?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Like, Boston has more schools per capita than anywhere in the US.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And that's how they're deciding the pecking order.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Right?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And then I lived in Los Angeles.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Okay?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   What do you think Los Angeles values?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Okay?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It's how you look and what you drive.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Okay?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And what I would say to you is Dallas is more like Los Angeles
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   than any city I've ever lived in.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And so when you step back, you've got to say,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   "Where am I getting my value?"
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And if you're trying to get your value from work,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   okay, that is not a stable place.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   We want to get our value from the fact that God loves us
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   and He's for us and He's with us.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Right?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   And if you don't get your value from there,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   you're setting yourself up for a big fall.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So is it wrong to pursue riches and fame and impact
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and influence in the world?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Are those wrong things to pursue?
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I would say your gifts are from God for God.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And so my question is, why are you pursuing those?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Is it for your glory or is it for God's glory?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   You are made with a purpose,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   and that purpose is not to bring yourself glory.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It's to bring God's glory.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   So I would have a lot of questions about your motivation.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   I don't think that it's wrong to want to make an impact,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   but why do you want to make an impact?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Do you want it to bring your glory or God?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   - Yeah, and I think, you know, Matthew,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Jesus is very clear in the book of Matthew,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   where He just says, you know,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   "Do not store up for yourselves, you know,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   temporary treasures, where moth and rust destroy
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   and thieves can break in and steal,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   but store up for yourselves treasure in heaven."
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   So the focus is, is that's the treasure
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   we're trying to build up,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   'cause that's the only thing that's gonna last.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And so you want to think long-term, right?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   You want to invest in long-term things.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And the one thing that's long-term
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   is your relationship with Jesus and doing eternal things.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   - 1 Timothy 6, 9 says,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   "But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation."
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   In the operative word there is desire,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   "who desire to be rich, fall into temptation,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   that plunge people into ruin and destruction."
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And then y'all know this famously,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   "For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   See, it's not that money or wealth or influence
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   or difference-making, whatever it is,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   it's not that those things are inherently wrong.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   They are morally neutral.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I think what Caitlin and John are saying is
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   your love is not intended for those things.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Your love is intended for God and God alone, right?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   His love has been lavished upon you
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   and in response to a love embraced
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   becomes a love that we return to God
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   and we extend to other people.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Now, God may give you wealth.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   He may give you fame.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   He may give you influence.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Truthfully, believers are the best to steward those resources
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   because God doesn't give to you,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   He gives through you, right?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   He's not impacting by you.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   He's impacting through you.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   This is the way that God works.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   He works through His people
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   and it's a delight for Him to partner with those
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   that are subject to Him first and foremost.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   One thing that I think in the vein of ambition
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   that I think is worth talking about in this moment
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   is a lot of people,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   they'll fall prey to, Caitlin, your story of workaholism.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Right? Like they will--
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   - I think it's glamorized in America.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   - Yeah, it totally is.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Especially amongst young adults, hustle culture's a thing.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   - So what does it look like for us to both hustle on the job
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   while being healthy in life?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   You know, my first boss, when I worked in advertising
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   and I was in that season that I described to you of working,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   a lot of it was self-imposed, 80, 90,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   'cause my entire identity was on my performance.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   He said to me something that I'll never forget.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   He said, "Caitlin, there's a cost to working as hard as you do,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   "and the problem is you won't know what the cost is
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "until you've already paid it."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And for me, it was my health, but for others,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   I think it could be community, it could be your spiritual life,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   it could be friendships.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   So my question, especially if you're caught up in this hustle culture,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   is are you paying attention to what it's costing you,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   not just what you're getting out of it,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   and is it worth the cost?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And then I think on a really practical side,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   God has given you a body to steward,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   and it's very important to steward your body,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   and I mean to pay attention to your health
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   and the health of your relationships,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   emotionally, spiritually, and physically,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   in the midst of your job.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And so when you start to get really off balance,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   something is wrong, and so if you can orient yourself
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   to your purpose in the Lord,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   often those things kind of right themselves,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   but it is so important to pay attention
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   to your physical, emotional, and spiritual health.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   That's great. John, would you add anything to this?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Yeah, I would say a couple of things.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   One, it's your job to keep yourself healthy.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   In general, bosses do not do a good job
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   of checking out on your health.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   So Caitlin's boss, that's an exception.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Most of them are happy if you want to stay later and do more stuff.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   And what I would say is when you are looking at a job,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   the boss sets the tone for the culture.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And that's how long you work,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   what kind of values you pursue,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   whether it's a competitive environment or a collaborative one.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And so that's who's going to set the pace.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And so if you're thinking about a job,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   that's who you want to look at
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   to decide is that going to be a good fit in that culture.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And you're looking for someone who's going to value that.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And it's not just looking to churn you up and spit you out.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   So how do we know when too much is being asked of us on the job?
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You want to take it, John?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Yeah, well, here's what I would say is you know it at the extremes.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And again, what I would say is sprinting for 100 yards,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   anybody can do that.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And there are times in all of our jobs
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   when we're asked to stay late.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Or there's an urgent project that needs to get done.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   The challenge is when that moves from being the exception to the norm.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Because now you're trying to sprint six miles or 60 miles.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And nobody can do that.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And so it's okay to sprint,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   but you just want to have this, not this red line at the top.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Totally.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And that's where knowing yourself is really important.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Knowing if you are prone to overwork
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   or if you're prone, to just be honest, y'all, to prone to underwork.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Like you should take an -- you owe it to yourself
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   to take an honest assessment of where you fall on that scale.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And let others into that to go, hey, that's just --
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   like they're both just as damaging to underwork or to overwork.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And so I would encourage you to take an honest assessment of yourself
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   and let your community into knowing like, hey, this is my ditch.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   My ditch is actually to overwork.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And in that scenario, you might want to have people lean into the pride
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   you might be getting from that overworking.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   If it's underworking, you might want to take assessment to see --
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   has entitlement crept into your heart somewhere
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   that you feel like you're entitled to take a two-hour lunch break
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   because you're working remote today and nobody will notice, right?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And so just -- you owe it to yourself now to take an honest assessment
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and invite others into helping you maintain that balance.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   That's really good.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   One of my favorite verses, which you may think is funny,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   but it's from the Bible, is Proverbs 6.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   It says, "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider his ways and be wise."
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   What's the author saying in that verse?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Consider the ant who's productive.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Like the ant knows when to work and when to rest.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I think that that is such an important concept for us to grasp
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   because we tend to go one way or the other.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   We'll burn the candle at both ends or we won't light the candle at all.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And yet what you see is that God has set a precedent for us.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   He worked for six days.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   He accomplished a lot in six days.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   He was maximally productive.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And then he rested on the seventh.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I think a lot of us will see that God worked,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and so I'm going to work, I'm going to put it out.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And yet you just probably need to take some time and rest.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   You probably need to take a day, and you need to rest, you need to reflect,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and you need to do something recreationally.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And yet others of us--and I've seen this within the church
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   over the last couple of years.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   We have idolized this idea of Sabbath.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   We've looked at it and we've said, "Man, I must have rest in my life,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   and so I'm going to really pull things back."
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And it's like, well, God took a day to do it,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   and so let's not take this thing further than it should.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Let's be really well-balanced as we consider working and resting.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   We're coming here to the end of our time,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   and so what I want to do is I want to just turn--
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   because one thing that we know--and we unpacked this again two weeks ago.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   We talked about, "Man, when we consider work on the job
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   and what's God's purpose for it,"
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   so often we're prone to just think, "I'm supposed to disciple
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   the people that are around me.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   I'm supposed to invest and share the gospel with my coworkers."
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   That's a big part of it.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   The other part of it, though, is what Genesis 2:15 would say,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   "We're supposed to have dominion and work the earth.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   We're supposed to take what's true of the garden.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   We're supposed to make it true of the rest of the world."
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   We've spent a lot of time talking about that,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   but it is still true that there is a witnessing component
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   to being on the job.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And so I'm just going to ask the simplest of questions here,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   and I'd love for you all to speak to it.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   What does it look like to represent Jesus on the job?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   As you look back at your corporate experience,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   how did you all do it in those environments?
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   For me, it was a lot more about the small moments
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   than I think the little moments.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   And what I mean by that, I think--the big moments, excuse me.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   So I think the big moments come in that you think of a time
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   where you shared the gospel or you said no to when your boss
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   was asking you to do something immoral.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Those are important, big, dramatic moments of sharing the gospel.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Absolutely important.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   But the little moments, I think the concept there of being set apart,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Colossians 3:12, that you're God's chosen people set apart
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   and sanctified for his purpose.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   How can you be set apart in small things?
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Things like your tone of voice, your tone when you communicate.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Are you being passive aggressive?
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Gossip, which I think in the workplace a lot of times we say,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   "I just seen an event about my boss."
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   No, that's gossip.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   So being set apart there, right?
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Are you taking part in a culture of crude joking, of drinking?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   How can you be set apart in those?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   And then taking an opportunity when people ask you
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   why you don't partake or why you're set apart
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   to relate it back to your faith.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   So for me, it's often been about the small things.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   When people ask me why I'm not excessively drinking at a happy hour,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   well, it's because I'm a person of faith.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Can I tell you about that, right?
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   So capitalize on those small moments.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Yeah, and I think the great thing about faith and work
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   is you get to see most of those people consistently, right?
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   So it's not one conversation.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   It's more about a lifestyle.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And I think what I've learned is, one,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   you want to be authentic about your faith.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Just be authentic about it.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And when people know that about you and you're trying to live it out,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   there will be a respect that comes from that.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   So that's part of it.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Second, you just want to share what God's doing in your life
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   because it's your story.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Hey, let me tell you what God's doing in my life.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And that is a way of pulling them in
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   so that they can be a witness of how God is at work in you.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And then I think the third thing is
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   a lot of times when we share the gospel with somebody,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   they'll say something like, "Oh, that's really interesting.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   I'm really glad that works for you."
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   And what I would say is that's not the end of the process.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   That's the start of the process.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Because your job, once you have that conversation,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   is you want to love that person in such a way
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   that when something goes wrong in their life,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   you're the very first person they call.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And that just means you love them, you care about them,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   you encourage them.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And look, life is difficult.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Sooner or later for all of us, things go wrong
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   and people begin to question.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And you want them to call you.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   You know, 'cause that's the path into a life of faith.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   - I had a professional mentor tell me one time
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   that on the job, you bless people
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   as far as they will let you bless them.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Because at some point,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   they are going to come looking for your blessing.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Like there is something deeply infectious
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   about the gospel,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   the way it impacts the lives of God's people.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   It leads us to be kind when other people are not kind.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   It leads us to work hard when everyone else is phoning it in.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   It leads us to be patient when no one else has patience
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   for that person or that situation.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   It causes us to speak words of wisdom
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   whenever a problem arises and no one else has a solution.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   The impact of walking with God
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   will make you a better employee.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   And here's the thing, people love to work alongside,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   advance, and promote good employees.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   But that's not why we do it.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   We do it because we have a Savior
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   that has gone above and beyond.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   He has worked to a great degree
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   to satisfy that which we could not satisfy ourselves.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   John, Caitlin, thank you so much.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   You are a great job of helping.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Big thanks to John and Caitlin.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Thank you all so much.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Thank you guys.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   You know, over the course of this evening,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   we really took the questions that you asked
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and we boiled them down to three different categories.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   And the categories that they boiled down to
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   were really purpose, balance, and witness on the job.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Like that's the broad strokes of everything that y'all asked.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   We didn't get to every single question,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   but that's really at the heart of you
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and the people sitting alongside of you
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   is this question of, man, what does it look like for me
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   to have purpose on the job?
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   How do I find balance between working really well
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   while also still being healthy,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   not succumbing to something toxic or difficult or dangerous?
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   And then how is it that I can witness
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   and be faithful to the faith that I carry,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   that I claim?
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   I stake my eternity on Jesus,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   so how then do I stake my job on Him as well?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   These are the questions y'all have been asking.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Here's what I would end our time with by just reminding you.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Your purpose at work,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   it's secured and it's solidified
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   when you consider Christ's purpose in life.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   That His purpose was to seek you out
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   when you were unworthy of being sought.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Like He was willing to go the distance to get to you
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   when everything around Him said, "It's not worth it.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   "They're not worth it."
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   His purpose was even still,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   "I want them to be with me where I am."
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   As you think about balance,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Jesus endured the most toxic of environments.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   He stepped into a world that was not habitable
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   for a perfect loving God,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   and yet He in His perfection came to a people
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   that were totally imperfect,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   that He might restore to you
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   a balanced relationship with God Himself.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   How did He do it?
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   He did it by embracing all of our imperfection.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   He lived the life we couldn't.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   You could not be perfect,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   and so He came and He was perfect in your place.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   He absorbed the full weight of your consequence,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   your sin, in dying the death you deserved upon the cross.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   And then He rose forth from the grave,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   and He witnesses to the watching world
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   the same way you should witness at your watching work,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   that He is alive,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   that He didn't just die and stay dead,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   but He rose forth from the grave,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   and He has made not just eternity out there forever
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   and in the future available to any
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   that would place their faith in God,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   but purpose and relationship and meaning.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   It's available right here, right now, even this evening,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   if only you would place your faith in Him.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Do you know Him?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Before you can work well,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   you've got to work things out with Him.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   He's come that you might work those things through tonight.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Let me pray for us.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   God, we love you.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   So grateful for an evening where, God,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   we can just take the truth of your word,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   and we can apply it right to our lives.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Every person in here, God, is wrapped up in a work situation.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   And yet, God, though this is true for all of us,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   I know there's a broad spectrum of circumstance in here
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   that some of us love our jobs,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   and others of us hate our job,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   and some of us are,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   we're stuck in the mundanity of our career,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   and others of us have deep meaning in the things we do.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   God, there is a broad array of experience here in this room,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   and yet, God, you have come to declare
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   there is purpose in what you do.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   I've come to give you balance while you work there,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   and I've also called you to be a witness
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   to save the world the same way I have saved you.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   God, would you work amongst my friends here?
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Would you lead us, Lord, to know you more?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And would we make a difference in our workplaces
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   for your glory and the good of others?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   It's in Christ, and we pray.
