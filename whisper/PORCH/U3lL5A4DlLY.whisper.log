[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   [music]
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Alright, alright. Summer's here. How you guys doing? Anybody been swimming?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Alright man, three of you have been swimming. That's great.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My family and I went swimming. First inaugural swim of the summer,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   which was a big deal. It was my niece's birthday party, and so it's at a swimming pool.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I'm excited. I like to swim. And I'm really excited because my son, he's about one and a half years old.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   This is really going to be his first swimming test.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Last year, in the summer, he couldn't swim. He could just float around.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I don't even think he knew he was in water.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   This year is going to be his first, "Hey, this is what water is. This is what we're going to do.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Daddy likes to swim. You're going to like to swim. That's how it's going to be."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   He's at a strange age, though. He's about one and a half, and a little older than one and a half.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I can't tell if he's disobedient, or he just doesn't know English yet.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He'll be running this way, and I'm like, "Weston, stop."
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He'll stop, and he'll look, and he'll go, "Ha ha ha ha ha."
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Then he'll just keep running. I don't know if I can discipline him,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   because there's a part of me that just thinks he has no idea what I'm saying.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   If somebody just told you to stop in another language, and you look at them like,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   "What did you say? Okay, I'm going to keep going this way."
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   This is problematic when we're swimming, because when we go to the pool,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   we show up, we walk through the gate, and I set him down, and he just starts running.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He sees the water. He doesn't know what it is, but it's sparkly.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's like a giant bathtub or something, and he's just running for it.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I run after him. I grab him. I'm like, "Whoa, no, no, no. Hold on.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We've got to put your swim shirt on or something."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Poor kid. He's got a swim shirt and floaties.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It looks like he fell in with his clothes on.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We put his little floatie, wrap him up in floaties, and I'm taking him in.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I kind of carefully carry him into the pool, and he is like having a ball.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   He's laughing and splashing, and he just thinks it's the greatest thing ever
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   that his feet are not touching the bottom of the bathtub, yet he's submerged in water and whatnot.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But all of a sudden, he's splashing, and he's kind of pushing away.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Then he's like, "No, no." He's learned the word "no."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   He's like, "No," and he starts pushing me.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   He wants to kind of go on his own in the swimming pool.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   He wants to swim. Of course, he can't.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I'm like holding him. I'm like, "No, Weston. You've got to stay right here.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Let Daddy hold you." He's really fighting me now.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He's like, "No, no." Then I kind of turn around, and I'm looking at Monica.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I'm looking at the other girls, and in a moment, he overpowers me,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   my one-and-a-half-year-old, and kicks out of my arms and just kind of bobs in the water,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   like his head go underwater.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Now, I know most of you are not parents, and so I don't know if you've ever seen a baby
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   when they get submerged, but God has given them this incredible reflex
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   where kind of everything seals up, I guess, so they don't drown.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It looks like this. That's what it looks like.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   He comes up out of the water, and he's just kind of frozen like that.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I'm like, "Weston, are you okay? Hey, Weston, Weston."
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He's just like--and so for 20 seconds, and then all of a sudden, he comes to,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and he just goes, "Ahh," and just starts screaming the loudest I've ever heard him scream.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He starts reaching for the side of the pool.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I carry him over. I'm like, "Hey, it's going to be okay."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I set him on the side of the pool, and he runs from the water now.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   There's a bunch of ladies there, and they all huddle around.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   "Weston, are you okay? Hey, come here. Are you okay? Are you all right? Did you drown?"
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I'm like, "He didn't drown. He's fine."
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   "Okay, let us talk. We need to talk, man-to-man here."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And so I-- "Hey, let me talk to my son here."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   "Hey, buddy. Hey." And he's screaming.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And I'm like, "Hey." Remember, he doesn't know English.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "You've got to trust me, okay?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I have been placed in authority over your life, and I care about you,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and I love swimming, and I want to have fun with you,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   but you've got to trust me in this pool."
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And so we slowly, kind of slowly moved back into the water,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   and I'm trying to show him that the authority over him is safe,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   but he is rebellious towards authority.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   My son, Weston, has an authority problem,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and this is what I know about that problem.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's going to be a problem for the rest of his life.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And I know that because his daddy has the same problem.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   "I just want to be free."
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I'm just saying that because I'm free.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And freedom to me translates in my mind--freedom from rules,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   freedom from anybody over me telling me what to do.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I want to be the person telling others what to do.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I don't want someone over me telling me what to do.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I want to create a kingdom for myself so that I can rise to the top,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   have enough money and enough power so that no one can tell me what to do.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   In my sinful desire, that is what I want.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I want to be free, and that's what freedom looks like.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   But the Scriptures tell us that freedom actually looks different,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   that true freedom in the Scriptures looks like a submission to authority,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   that this is a call of the believer, of the Christian, of the one who follows Christ.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And so what Weston's struggle is, his struggle with authority,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   is essentially, "I want to be in charge.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I don't understand why I'm not in charge.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And can I really trust the one who is in charge?"
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Your struggle with authority is you want to be in charge.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You don't understand why you're not in charge.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And you're asking, "Can I really trust the one who is in charge?"
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And I'm not just talking about God.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I'm talking about government.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I'm talking about your employer.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I'm talking about your church leaders.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I'm talking about anyone who is in authority over you,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   which begs the question for you to answer before we go any further,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   who is in authority over you?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And I've had young adults tell me, people who graduated from seminary tell me,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   "Only God," which sounds very spiritual and extremely unbiblical.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   "Only God, man. Only God."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Man, that sounds good. It's just wrong.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It's just not what God says,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   that all of us are to exist under authority.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So before we go further, you should contemplate who is in authority over you.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And let me just say before we go any further also that bad authority is a fact.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's a symptom of this really fallen world that we live in.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But how Christians, how those in the room who claim to follow Christ
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   or follow Christ maneuver through bad authority
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   is one of the greatest tests you will face in this world.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   How you maneuver through bad authority.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And so I think for so many of us, our quarter-life crisis,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   as we move through this series and we're talking about
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   kind of coming to this crisis that we face in our 20s and 30s,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   one of them is, "I want to be in charge. I don't understand why I'm not in charge.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And I don't trust the one who says they are in charge."
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And so this evening we're talking about submitting to authority.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Specifically the command of submitting to authority in the Scripture.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Then we're going to talk about who we submit to.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And before you leave here, why we can trust the authority over us.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And I'm going to be in the book of 1 Peter.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It's towards the ends of your Bible, towards the back of your Bible,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   right after James.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So as you keep moving towards the back, you will eventually get to 1 Peter.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Turn to chapter 2 with me.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Let me set this up. The book is written to the persecuted church.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So this is the church under persecution under Nero,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   the emperor's reign in about 64 AD.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So about 64 years after the birth of Jesus, when the calendar reset.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   We're now 2014 years after that date.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   This is about 64 years after that date.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Under Nero's reign, Peter writes to the church who is being persecuted
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   in this chapter about how they should submit to bad authority.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Or how to maneuver submitting to bad authority.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And we don't even like that word "submit," but it's a biblical word.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It's one we'll see over and over.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And honestly, this text, it almost reads like hyperbole.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It almost seems like an exaggeration.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's going to cover the most extreme circumstances of authority,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   as it says that we should submit to even that.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And we're going to talk about three forms of authority this evening.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   The government, our government, our employer, and before you leave here,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   the church, and as I said, we're going to talk about why.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So 1 Peter 2, verse 11.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And I'll tell you before I say this, that the reason this has landed
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   into the quarter-life crisis series is because it is a repeated idea
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   in the scripture.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   It's an extremely important idea in the scripture.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And as I've met with many of you, I think it is something that
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   our generation really, really struggles with.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And I don't know that we fully understand the biblical command
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   as it relates to this idea of authority.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   "Dear friends," verse 11, "Dear friends, dear porch, you guys, listen,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I urge you," this is a strong word, "I urge you," this is really just
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   to set up where we're headed, "as foreigners and exiles," or aliens,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   "as people in this world that don't belong to this world,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   what I'm asking you to do is to abstain from sinful desires
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   which wage war against your soul."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Do we have sinful desires which wage war against our soul still?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Or is this just a 64 AD thing?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Is it still a 2014 sinful desires wage war against our soul?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I'm glad I'm not the only one.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   "Live such good lives among the pagans," so live such good lives
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   among those who do not believe in the God that you believe in,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   "that though they accuse you of doing wrong or persecute you,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   they may see your good deeds, they may see the good things that you do,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   the good life that you live, and glorify God on the day that He visits us."
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And so here's the premise that Peter sets up.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   He says, "You live in a world that you do not belong to.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   This is not your kingdom. God is the king of your kingdom.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You are in this temporary world. It's almost just a simple test
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   or simply a test, said otherwise, that you're here for just a little while,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and in this world there's going to be lots of temptations
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   that your flesh wants that are dangled in front of you
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   that the enemy persuades you towards.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Stand firm against those temptations which wage war against your soul
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   so that when others see you do good and live a godly life,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   they would be attracted to your God."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   It's so simple that you're like, "Hey, what is the purpose of my life?"
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   There it is laid out pretty simply.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "After you've trusted in Christ, so this is not a do good to be saved,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   but because you have been saved, because God has saved you in spite of you,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   you live a good life."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And then he says this, "Submit yourselves," there's that word,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority,"
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   what authority, God? "Every human authority,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   whether the emperor as the supreme authority or the governors
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   For it is God's will," what is God's will?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   "That by doing good," it is God's will that you would do good,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   "For by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Live as God's slaves," okay, so ultimately submitting to God as his slaves,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   "Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   fear God, and honor the emperor."
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So my first point this evening is what does it look like to live under authority?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   We're going to talk about living under authority.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   What does it look like, the command for us to live under authority?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And so the "what" is right there in verse 13.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   What do I need to do? What do I need to do with this text?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   "Submit yourself for the Lord's sake to every human authority."
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Okay, so let me just say this real quick because there's a few words that are real important.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "For the Lord's sake."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   You can submit to authority and do so in a sinful way.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Because of the fear of man, because of the fear of consequences.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   But he's saying, "No, you should submit to authority for the Lord's sake."
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   For the Lord's sake, this is why you do this.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Not because of the fear of man.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So the "what" is submit yourself to every human authority for the Lord's sake.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Why? Why would we do that? Why would the Scripture ask us to?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Really clearly right here in the Scripture.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   "For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   "Said otherwise," or it will go on to explain,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   "that others would see the good that you do and be attracted to your God."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   That you're like a giant billboard pointing to Him.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Like, "Hey, this is the way to live."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   He's made life, He knows how to live it better than any of you do.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Better than Dr. Phil does. Better than Cosmopolitan Magazine does.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Better than any book you could read does.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   God knows how to live this life.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And so how should we do that?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   The "what" is submit yourself.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Why? It's because by doing good we bring people to God.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   How? How do we do that?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   By showing, straight from the Scripture,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   showing proper respect to everyone,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   loving the family of believers,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   fearing God,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and honoring the Emperor.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And so remember the premise, we do not belong in this world,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   but by the way that we live in a world that we do not belong to,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   others would be drawn to the king of the world that we belong to,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   and they would want to belong to that world.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You guys get it?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   An illustration.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Jackie Robinson was one of the first African Americans in Major League Baseball.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Branch Rickey, manager of the Dodgers, recruited him,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   not because, maybe you've seen the movie 42,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   it was a great movie,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   one of the things that it left out, I read an article this week in USA Today,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   one of the things that the movie 42 left out
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   was actually all about Jackie Robinson's faith.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   He had an incredible faith in Christ.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And the reason Branch Rickey recruited him
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   was not solely because of his athletic ability.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   There were other African Americans who could really play the game of baseball.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   But the article said that Branch Rickey recruited him
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   because of his faith and honorable character.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Now why? Why would Branch Rickey hold dearly to faith and honorable character?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Here's why.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Because he knew that he was going to move Jackie Robinson
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   into an incredibly corrupt and turmoil organization
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   where people were going to persecute him,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   say awful things about him, bring death threats to him,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   bring death threats to his loved ones,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and the only way that this African American
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   was going to be able to persevere through this
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   was if he had a faith in something bigger than himself.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Was if he could trust or be under an authority
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   greater than the authority of this world.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And as we know, so Jackie Robinson moves to the team,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   the team actually creates a petition to get him off the team,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   his own teammates, out of their own ignorance and closed-mindedness,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   they want him off the team.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   And he wins them over how? By his conduct,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   by the way he responded to people,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   and by the way he played the game with excellence.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And in the same way, this is why you work,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   this is how you are a citizen,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   this is how you are a contributor in your church,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   that others would see your conduct and glorify your Father in Heaven.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Man, I want to know what team they play for.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I want to play for their manager.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I don't like them, I don't agree with them,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   but they've got my attention.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Because of the way that they live,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   because of how they do good,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   and because of how they do things with excellence.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And so we live as free people,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   not free from authority,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   but freed to honor authority
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   because of what Christ has done for us,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   free from rebelling against authority
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   in a way that doesn't honor God.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Everyone is rebellious in nature,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   we see that in Weston at one and a half years old,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that he didn't have to learn to be a rebel, right?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It comes natural to him,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   and it comes natural to you,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   but the way that you're different than the world
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   is you are free not to rebel.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And so, for the purpose of winning others to ultimate authority,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   and so what authorities are over us?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   My second point this evening, or second question,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   what authorities are over us?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Let's understand that it says every human authority,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   in fact in 1 Peter 5, verse 5, same book, different chapter,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   it says that we're actually to submit to those who are older than us,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   not even talking about elders of a church,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   but just simply older people,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   that there's this kind of hierarchy even in society.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And so it says to every human authority,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   but I think of the three that this Scripture covers,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   and three very relevant to young adults,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   is the first one is the government.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   We're to submit to the government.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   What does that look like?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   We obey the laws, okay?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   The other day I got pulled over for speeding, okay?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Long story, it's not really a long story,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I was speeding, I got pulled over, that's the story.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   You know what the first thing that went through my mind was?
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   This is the first, I'm sure I'm alone on this,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I'm sure you guys don't think this way,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   but because I'm so rebellious,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   the first thing that goes through my mind is,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   "How do I get out of this ticket?"
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Okay?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   In spite of my efforts, I got the ticket,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   and do you know what the second thing on my mind was?
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   After I received the piece of paper that was a ticket?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   "How do I get out of paying this ticket?"
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Right?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Why?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Because I'm rebellious.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Because I do not like an authority over me.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Let me say it like this,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I do not like to submit to authority.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I don't even want the consequences from my action.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I want to be free from the consequences for my action.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   I want to feel like I am above authority.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I do not want to submit.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   But this scripture has incredible implications for us.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It's not only that we obey the laws,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   but that we would honor, it says, the president,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   it says the emperor, but in our implications, the president.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   That we do not slander our president.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Wow.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   That you can express your opinion,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   but make sure your conduct is louder than your speech.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   What this means is that maybe you have an opinion
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   about marriage or abortion or about health care
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   or about POW exchanges.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Maybe you have opinions about these things,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   but you make sure your conduct is louder
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   than the way that you speak about those in authority over you
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   so that others would see your conduct and say,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   "Man, I want to listen to what they have to say.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   "I don't just, the way she lives her life above her approach,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   "the way he lives his life, I'm listening.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   "And if he tells me abortion's wrong, I'm curious at least.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   "I want to understand why."
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And so, maybe right now you're thinking,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   "Well, what if he's, what if the authority over me,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   "what if the government that is placed over me at some point,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   "what if they're wicked, what if they're corrupt?"
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Cool. Let's talk about Nero for a second, okay?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Nero was not just a government raising your taxes
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   or passing bad health care.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Nero was a cross-dresser who was burning Christians alive.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   He killed his mother and his first wife.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   He married a boy child, had him castrated,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   and had him dress up like a woman and pretend to be his wife.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And God, through Peter, is saying, "Honor that man."
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Okay, so whatever government you have over you
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   at any time in the future, you go back and you look at Nero,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   this guy seems to have, and I want to say something slanderous about him,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   but I was encouraged not to, so I wouldn't even break the rule here.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   It's interesting that the Scripture never does.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   History tells us some crazy things about him,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   but the Scripture never slanders him.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   In fact, the Scripture tells us to honor him.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   By the way, the very man who penned this letter,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Nero crucified him upside down.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   The very man asking you to honor him was crucified upside down.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Here's what this means.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Whether you wear your seatbelt or stay under the speed limit
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   or slander the president has implications to God.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   In fact, his glory is at stake.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Why? God cares.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   That is what this Scripture is pointing out to us.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And so I would just encourage you to pray for President Obama
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   more than you slander him.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Consider what would happen if all of your prayers for him were answered
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and live in such a way that others would be drawn to your opinion
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   because of how you live and conduct,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   how you live and act around these issues.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Fear God and honor the president, the Scripture says.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   The second thing that we submit to from the Scripture
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   is we submit to our employer, the one who is over us.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It says this in verse 18,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   "Slaves, in reverent fear of God, submit yourselves to your masters."
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Now, slaves and masters in this culture, it's not a racial slavery.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   That's important to know.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   All we know in this world is a racial slavery,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   or at least in our culture is a racial slavery in recent history.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   But here it's not a racial slavery.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   It's actually an agreement that, hey, you would work here
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   and I would give you provision for life.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   That's the slave and master relationship.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   It's the closest thing that we have to an employee-employer relationship.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And so read here, "Employees, in reverent fear of God,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   "submit yourself to your employers,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   "not only to those who are good and considerate,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   "but also to those who are harsh."
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   The Scripture says that bad employers are a reality
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   and that we're to submit ourselves to those who are even harsh.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   It says, "In reverent fear of God."
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   That's, again, important.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Not because you fear man, not because you fear consequences,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   but only because you fear God Almighty.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And, of course, you can sin in how you submit
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   if your perspective is off.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And so this slave-master relationship, though it was not a racial slavery,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   it was also not always a pleasant relationship.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And so anybody here have a bad boss?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Don't raise your hand because they may be behind you.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And you don't know it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And so certainly some folks here have had or currently have
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   or will have a bad supervisor, a bad boss.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Let me tell you that the Scripture's going to paint a picture of a bad supervisor.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   "For it is commendable," God commends you,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "if someone bears up under the pain," and it means pain there,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   "of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   "But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating,"
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and it means beating, "for doing wrong and endure it?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   "this is commendable before God."
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And so I don't know what your boss has done,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   but my hunch is he hasn't beaten you.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Right?
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And so the Scripture is painting a picture
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   that the reason that you work,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   that that employer-employee relationship
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   goes far beyond if you like your job.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   It goes far beyond if you like what you're doing.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It goes far beyond if you're passionate about it.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And it says the reason that you are there
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   is because of some other relationship,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   so that others would see you being the most excellent person there
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and honoring your God,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and in fact the persecution that you endure there,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   it says it is commendable to God.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And this is why we talk about work so much,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   because what we do in our generation,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and I've done it too, I'm completely guilty of this,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   is I jump into a job until it's difficult,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and then I jump out.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Like, "It's not God's will that I be there."
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And then I jump into another job until it's difficult,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and then I'm like, "Well, it's not God's will that I be there either."
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   And so I jump into another job,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and so we know statistically our generation
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   is only at an employer for about two years,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   which is a historical low by years,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   because we're looking for contentment at work
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   when the Scriptures tell us that we're not entitled to it.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   In fact, it says work is hard and work is toilsome,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   as we covered a few weeks ago.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   But it says that if you suffer for doing good,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   it is commendable before God.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Colossians 3, verse 22, says it like this.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Slaves, read employees,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   obey your earthly employers in everything and do it,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   not only when their eye is on you to curry their favor,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   which is what we often do, like, "Hey, if he's looking,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   "like, I'm going to do everything I'm supposed to do."
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   But with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   as working for the Lord, not for human masters.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Since you know that you will receive an inheritance
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   from the Lord as a reward,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   it is the Lord Christ you are serving.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Here's my quick summary of the second part of that passage.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   God distributes the promotions.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   God's in charge of the promotions.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   God chooses who gets promoted and who doesn't.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   The rewards are up to God.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Do you believe that you're actually working for Him?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   It's the Lord Jesus Christ you are serving.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   That's who you're serving.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You are working for God at Starbucks.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   You're working for God in retail.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   You're working for God at Richardson ISD, at Dallas ISD,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   at Plano ISD, at McKinney ISD, at whatever ISD.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   You're working for God at Raytheon, at AT&T, at ABC Company.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And that God that you're actually working through
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   often works through bad bosses to bring about His will.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   He works through corrupt employers to bring about His will.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I had a boss who was really difficult.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I won't even say he was a bad boss.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   He was a very difficult boss.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   He asked a lot of me, and I didn't like doing it.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Why? Because I do not like to submit to authority.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I like to be authority.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I don't like to submit to authority.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And so he would ask me to fill out these daily activity reports
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   to show what I did.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   He would ask me to--we'd have to review my sales funnel.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   This was when I was in sales.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   He would ask me--he'd want to look at every customer
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   that I was calling on in detail.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   He would ask me questions I didn't know the answers to,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and so I would squirm in my chair.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And he would always say this.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   He would always say this, like, "Hey, JP,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   "you only grow when you're uncomfortable.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   "You only grow when you're uncomfortable."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And so I'm like, "Well, I'm growing here
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   "'cause you're making me uncomfortable."
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And so I think about that, and it's interesting
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   'cause today, as I get to shepherd others and manage,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   it's interesting that I manage more like him
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   than any other boss that I've ever had.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   In fact, I learned a lot of leadership from him.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And he's right.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   You do only grow, or growth, I'll say.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Growth happens most often when you're uncomfortable.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And so you don't know how God is going to use
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   the relationship that is over you today.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   In fact, I had another boss tell me shortly thereafter,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   "Jonathan, I think you have a problem trusting
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   "the wisdom that has gone, that comes from people
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "who have gone before you."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   And he's right.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Usually, and just to be transparent
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   and to show you grossness that's in here,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   usually I'm sitting there thinking I know better
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   than everyone else in the room, and I know that's stupid.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   But it happens a lot.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Like, I'm sitting there, and I'm like,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "No, I know how to solve that problem.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   "You guys don't know how to, I mean, keep talking
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   "and wasting your time if you want,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   "but if you want me to speak and tell you
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   "how to fix this, I will."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And it's gross.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And I'm usually wrong, right?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And he just said, "I think you have a problem
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "trusting the wisdom that comes from those
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   "who have gone before you.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "You don't appreciate it."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   But the scripture says that we actually should.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And so are you the best employee there?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Are you the one that they can't afford to lose?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   It says in verse 21, "To this you were called
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   "because Christ suffered for you,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   "leaving you an example that you should follow
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   "in his steps."
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And so who did Christ suffer for?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I know that John 3:16 says, "For God so loved
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   "the whole world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But actually, Christ suffered for his bride, the church.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And so this letter is written to the church.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And so this letter isn't even to you.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   If you're on the outside looking in,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   if you're not a part of the local church,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I'm not talking about big C church right now,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   'cause here's the church are people,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   church are those who follow Jesus.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   But the way that we're to follow Jesus,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   as it's outlined in the scripture,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   is we're actually to, ready for it,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   be under authority in the church.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   So if you're wondering, "Well, am I at a church or not?"
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   It would be like this, who at a church,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   okay, someone that God has put in a position
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   at a church is in authority over you.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And if you think it's just me on Tuesday nights,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   I'm sad to tell you, you're wrong.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   That if you're just here on Tuesday nights,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I am in no authority over you.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   I teach from the scriptures, okay?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I can give you advice, so can Dr. Phil, okay?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   So can your mom, right?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   But let's be honest, you're not under my authority
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   or anyone else's if you're just here on Tuesday night.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   But the scripture calls you to belong at a church,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   and actually to submit to church leadership.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   In verse 17 it says, it's written,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   this is to the family of believers.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Hebrews 13 verse 17 says it like this.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   "Have confidence in your leaders,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   "and submit to their authority,"
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   the word leaders there is actually pastors,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   "and submit to their authority,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   "because they keep watch over you
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   "as those who must give an account.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   "Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   "for that would be of no benefit to you."
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And this is a clear idea, really repeated
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   throughout scripture that God's idea
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   or God's desires for the believer
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   is that you would be at a church.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And so if you're here and you're saying,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   okay, how do I begin to be submissive to authority?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I wanna do this, I'm not a speeder,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I'm not wearing my seatbelt, I'm honoring my boss,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   or I'm not, maybe you are, maybe you're not,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I don't know, where do I start?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Church is a great place to start.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   If you don't belong to a church,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   in case somebody told me, hey,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   the reason people don't belong to church
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   is they don't know they're supposed to.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Can I just say it really clearly?
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   So that the 3,000 of you will know that you're supposed to.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   You are supposed to belong to a church.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   That is God's will for you, I say that.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Not even with fear and trepidation,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   'cause I see it in the scripture.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   That you would belong to a church.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And that you would be under the protection of a church.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And that protecting you would be a part
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   of what your pastors are actually compensated to do,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   to help you in relationships,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   to help you understand the scriptures,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   to help you live in community,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   that they would help you in this,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   that you would not be some rogue sheep on your own.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   God's sheep, the sheep that belong to God,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   are always under an appointed shepherd.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   You can look at any time in church history,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and that has been the case.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   That God's sheep are always protected
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   by an appointed shepherd.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's certainly the case here in Peter's letter
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   to the persecuted church.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And so this might be the solution
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   to your quarter-life crisis.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Like, possibly, the reason you're experiencing,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   or have experienced, or will experience,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   a quarter-life crisis is because you are
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   a rogue sheep without a shepherd.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   And I'm not saying that you're not a Christian,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   or not a believer, or not even, you know,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   you don't believe in God,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   or you don't have a trust in Christ.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   I'm saying that you are not under the authority
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   of the church, quite possibly.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   You have to answer that.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   An application from this message for you.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And I'm not trying to grow Watermark, either.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Like, maybe you live far away,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   maybe it's some other church.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Okay, we're not holding a membership class after this.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   That's not what's going on here.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I'm admonishing you, I'm encouraging you
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   to join a church, to be at a church,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   to be under authority of a church for your sake,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   as submission to God and His scriptures
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and His Holy Spirit,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   that you would belong to a local body, the church.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And so, some of you must be here,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and you have to be asking right about now,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   well, when do we rebel?
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   There has to be a time when we rebel against authority.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Here's what I would say to you,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   never apart from church.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   That's a part of those who have been entrusted
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   to shepherd you, to help you understand when to rebel.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   So you could come to them and say,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   hey, I've got this bad boss,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and I don't want to slander him,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   but here's factually what he's asking me to do.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   He's telling me I've got to go to strip clubs
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   if I want to stay employed there.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   He's telling me that I've got to, you know,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   fudge the numbers.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   He's telling me that I've got to lie here.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   I don't know what to do.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And the church can help you maneuver
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   and navigate those waters.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And so, we're all so rebellious
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   that at times we're asking, wait a minute,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   like when does scripture give me permission
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   to be rebellious?
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   'Cause that would be awesome.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   God tells me I can rebel.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   It's got to say, right, like, you know,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   and we're there, and we're like, man, I hope,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I hope Obama asks me to do something crazy
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   so I can show him, I'm not gonna do it, I'll picket.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   The White House, that's what I'll do.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And we all, like, have that inside of us.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   We all secretly want to be Batman, you know,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   some vigilante, like, hey, I want to take matters
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   into my own hands, you know, I can't wait.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Man, I hope, hey, I hope my boss,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I hope my boss asks me to do,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   he might have asked me to go to strip club,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   I'm gonna blow up, I'm gonna tell him,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   no, I ain't going to strip club.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Right, and that's how we want to do it.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And people will come to me like,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   yeah, you wouldn't believe what that guy,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   he would say, strip club.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   And I'm like, hey, hey,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   have you told him why you can't go to a strip club?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Yeah, I told him.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Did you tell him like that?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   'Cause I would fire you on the spot.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Did you just sit there and say,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   hey, I want to be the best employee that you have?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Man, I want to do everything that you ask of me and more.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I've got a moral issue with this thing right here
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   because I serve a God who's asked me to do something else,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   and I can't do that.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   But can I suggest another way?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Like, what if instead of the strip club,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I took the customer to coffee?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Okay, no naked women,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   but great baristas.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And what if there we had a conversation?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Like, that's what you can do when,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   see, we all want to bow up.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   We all want to take matters into our own hands.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   We're all rebels, and that rebel bleeds into
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   even rebelling against that which we think is wicked,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   and there's a right way to do it.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   My daughter, Presley, she's such a rule follower.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And in fact, she's been in school two years.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   She just graduated from first grade, or just passed first grade, I guess.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Don't graduate, just pass.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And she's only gotten in trouble one time,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and by in trouble, I mean she had to change her color.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Like, that's the kind of,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   you may have got your name on the board or something,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   but they have to change their color.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And she's only had to do that one time,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and I was actually in Haiti when it happened,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and Monica called me, or we were FaceTiming.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I was in Haiti, and Monica said,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   "Hey, Presley had to change her color today.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   "It was pretty devastating for her."
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And I said, "Well, what happened?"
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And so Presley's best friend in school is autistic.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   It's really sweet, and just, for whatever reason,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   God has put the two of them together,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and her best friend is autistic.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And Presley was at lunch,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   and these boys were making fun of her best friend.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And Presley said, "Hey, will you stop it?"
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And they kept making fun of her best friend.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And so my little sweet girl, little rule follower,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   got up and started kicking him as hard as she could,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   saying, "Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And Monica's telling me this.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And I'm secretly, like, shouting for joy, you know?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I'm like, "Was it the roundhouse?"
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   'Cause I taught her the roundhouse, you know?
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And I realized, though, that she broke the rules.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And so we have to have a conversation.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And I sit Presley down, and I say,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   "Hey, Presley, I want you to know something."
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And maybe you're like,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   "Well, this is Presley's version of the story."
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   No, this is the teacher who told me this version of the story.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   And so I said, "Presley, listen.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "I completely understand why you did what you did.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   "You saw an injustice, and you stood against it.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   "But I want you to know that God has put people there
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   "to protect you.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   "And so, you know, you need to go through
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   "those right layers in order to protect your friend."
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And so the right thing to do next time,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   rather than stand up and begin to kick--
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I go, "Did you kick him hard? How'd you kick him?"
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   No.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   And so rather than kick them,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   you would go and you would get the teacher in the lunchroom,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   and you would say, "Hey, this is what's happening.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   "Can you help?"
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   And that raised off lots of questions.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   "Well, Daddy, what if she doesn't do anything?"
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Or, "What if, you know, they start kicking me?"
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Or, "What if this? What if that?"
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   That's when you get your daddy.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   All right?
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   That's when you get your daddy.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   And I said, "Otherwise, here's what I would say to you.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   "That's when you trust your daddy."
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Okay?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And in the same way that Presley has a daddy
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   that's kind of over that to protect her,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   each of you should have a church that you belong to--
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   God's expression of the local church that you belong to--
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   that is there to protect you in these circumstances
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   so that you can go to them and say,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   "Hey, will you help me here?"
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Every now and then, people will come to us,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and they want help or financial help or whatever,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   and I just get to ask them these hard questions
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   that are simple like, "Are you a member somewhere?"
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   So I should say, "No, you don't understand.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   "I've been podcasting so-and-so and going here and whatever,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   "and I just need to pay rent, man."
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Man, I would love to help you pay rent, okay?
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Can you come here and come under our authority?
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   It would be irresponsible for us just to give you a handout.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   We don't know you.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   We don't know how you're going to spend that money,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   but we would love to help you.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Hear my heart.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   We would love to help you,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   but that would mean that you're a part of the flock
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   that we shepherd, and so can we shepherd you?
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   And far too often, that person says,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   in some way, form, or fashion,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   "No, I'm unshepherdable."
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And I say, "Oh, I understand how you got in your situation."
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   And I'm not saying that that's always the case,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   but I have seen that case many, many times.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Far too often, I would tell you.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   "He committed," Christ, "no sin,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   "and no deceit was found in his mouth.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   "When they hurled insults at him, he did not retaliate.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   "When he suffered, he made no threats.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   "Instead, he," that's Christ,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   "entrusted himself to him," that's God,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   "who judges justly," his daddy.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   "He himself bore our sins," the gospel,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   "in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   "and live for righteousness," the gospel.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   "By his wounds you have been healed," the gospel.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "For you were like sheep going astray,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   "but now you have returned to the shepherd
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   "and overseer of your souls."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   You have come back to the ultimate authority
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   who is the one who judges justly.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   He trusted himself to him who judges justly.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   My third and final point is simply,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   all authority is God's.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   This is why you can submit to bad authority,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   because all authority is under God's authority.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   It's not the what do I do, it's the who do I serve.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   I'm not actually serving the government
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   when I buckle my seatbelt, I'm actually serving God.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   I'm not serving the government when I go to the speed limit,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   I'm actually serving God.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   I'm not serving my employer when I do this with excellence,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I'm serving God.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   I'm not serving my employer, okay,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   when I sell, when I teach, when I do these things,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   when I take the TPS reports, whatever that is for you,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   you're serving God.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   That is what the scripture's saying.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   And so this means it matters to God what you do,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   whether you wear your seatbelt or not.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   It matters to God if you gossip about your boss or not,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   that really matters to God.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   It matters to God if you are under the authority
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   of a church or not, that matters to God.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   And if you're not, you don't have a government problem
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   or a boss problem or a church problem,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   you have a God problem.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   It is for Weston's good that he is under my authority,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   that he actually has a daddy who loves him.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   But all authority that you could possibly be under
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   is actually under the authority of a daddy who loves you,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and you need to know that.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   And he's asked you to submit to their authority
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   in a way that honors him until they ask you to do something
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   that goes outside of his ultimate authority,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   until you are asked to sin.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   But even when you are asked to sin,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   you respond in a way that honors him.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   It's really important, because I think we're all waiting
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   for that time, "Well, I hope they ask me to sin
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   "so I can show them what's up."
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   No, no, you would honor God, even in that circumstance.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And so this text shows you this amazing truth of the gospel,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   that you've been set free, that Christ has died
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   on your behalf for your sins,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   that you don't have to pay for your sins,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   that Christ paid for your sins, and if you trusted
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   that Christ paid for your sins through his death
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   and resurrection, then you will be with God forever.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Remember where we started, you belong to another kingdom, man.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   You're gonna be with God forever, man.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   For just a little while, it's a test,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   and then you're gonna die, and you're gonna go be with God
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   and a billion, billion years, you're still gonna be with God
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   in his kingdom.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   And this was just a momentary and light affliction,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   a little test that you had to endure there at Starbucks
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   or ABC Company or whatever it is, right?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And so this test, or this text rather,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   shows Jesus' amazing example,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   the one who created all things, right?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   He spoke them into existence, that's King Jesus.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And it shows how he submitted to authority.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   King Jesus submitted to authority.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Remember when they came to him in the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and they say, "Are you the one called the Christ?"
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And he says, "I am he," and they fall over.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   The army falls over, I wish I could've seen that.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   They just fell over like dominoes.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Like, do you think he's authoritative?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Do you think he has authority?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   And it says he submitted himself to authority.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   He didn't need to cuss back, he didn't need to spit back,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   he didn't need to fight back.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   He just trusted himself to the one who judges justly.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   In fact, in John 19, Jesus is before Pilate,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   and Pilate's asking him questions, and Jesus doesn't say anything.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   And Pilate says in verse 10,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   "Do you refuse to speak to me?"
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Pilate said, "Don't you realize that I have power
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   either to free you or to crucify you?"
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And Jesus now speaks, he answers,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   "You would have no power over me
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   if it were not given to you from above.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Therefore, the one who handed me over to you
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   is guilty of a greater sin."
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   This idea is repeated in Romans 13,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and here in 1 Peter 2, but Romans 13 says this,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   "For there is no authority except that which God has established.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   The authorities that exist have been established by God.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   is rebelling against what God has instituted."
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And so Jesus is here, and he knows his daddy is in charge,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   and that his daddy can bring about good
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   even through his persecution, even through his torture,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   even through his death.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Did good come through Jesus' death?
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   You've been set free, man.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   It is through Christ's death about 2,000 years ago
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   that you have been set free.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   You are trusting in that for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   And so God hasn't lost control
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   when you don't agree with your government.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   God hasn't lost control when you don't agree with your boss.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   God is still very much at work
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   through the authorities he has in place,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   especially his church.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   And so remind yourself where we started,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   that you're not of this world.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   About 12 years ago,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   I wanted one thing in life,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   and it was to be free.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   I was just a kid born on a farm in a small town.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Went to a small technical college you've never heard of.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   I moved to Dallas,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   and man, it was my ticket.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Dallas was my ticket.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   It was my ticket to freedom.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   And here was my plan, and I had a good one.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Work hard, make money,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   stack up a 401(k), flip some houses, okay?
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Work in corporate America, have my health insurance be covered
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   and protected and be free from everything.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Build my kingdom so that I could do--
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   I wanted to work hard so my boss would stay off me,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   so that I could do whatever it was that I wanted to do.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   I wanted to be free.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   I was upstairs at a bar on Lower Greenville, a club.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Someone invited me to a church.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   And even then, I thought I would strike this deal with God,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   like, "Hey, God, you give me some good tips and tricks
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   "on how to live this life, okay?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   "I believe you're there, you're God.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   "You probably got some good information for me.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   "Can you kind of feed me some truth
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   "that will get me through the week,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   "and let me just kind of go out and party
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   "and do whatever it is I want to do?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   "I'll come back to you, I'll tell you I'm sorry,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   "you'll forgive me, like, I've heard that part of the gospel.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   "It's all good."
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   And I stumbled in, I sat in the back of the church,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   I was hungover, smelled like smoke from the night before.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And a guy told this story,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   and it changed my life, and it was a stupid story.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   It was the reason God used it to change my life,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   or it's a silly story, I'll say.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   It's actually a children's story.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   It comes from this book I later found out.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   The book I read to my little girls now,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Adventures of Thunder Hoof.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Here's the story.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   There was a wild stallion that just wanted to be free.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Man, I can relate to that.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   I'm listening.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   He wanted to be free, man.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   He rode a horse, and he roamed the mountainside
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   in search of freedom.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   And in his freedom, he had to hunt for food
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   and hunt for water and find protection
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   from the elements, from the storms and the rains
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   that would come.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   And people would try to capture this horse,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   but they would fail.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   And one day, this farmer, this cowboy,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   successfully captured this horse, this wild stallion,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   and he took him home, and he loved him,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   and he cared for him, and he provided for him.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   And through that love, care, and provision,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   eventually he was able to break this horse.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   And in breaking this horse, he was able to mount this horse
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   and ride this horse.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   And in riding this horse, he would lead him to food,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   and he would lead him to water,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   and he would lead him to protection from the elements.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And it was this line that changed my life.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   It wasn't until he was fully submissive to his master
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   that he truly experienced freedom.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   And I realized that I had been wearing myself out
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   in pursuit of freedom, all while taking this for granted,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   telling you that I believed this, but doing nothing
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   that would tell you that I actually believed this.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Telling you that I was a part of the church,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   but not belonging anywhere, podcasting this guy,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   podcasting that guy, whatever, but not belonging anywhere.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Telling you that I loved God, but doing whatever I wanted.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   And I sat there, and I said this prayer.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   I said, "Lord, if you're God, if you created everything,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   "then you know how to do life so much better than I do.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   "I've heard you sent your son to die for my sins.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   "This is good, 'cause I need someone to pay for my sins.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   "There's a lot of them.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   "Lord, would you drive?
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   "Lord, would you show me where to go?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   "Lord, I submit my life to your care now,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   "through the death and the resurrection of your son Jesus,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   "believing that he died for my sins.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   "Father, would you give me new life?"
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   And he did.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   And what he killed in that moment was my rebellious spirit.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Every now and then it flares up,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   but he's gracious to remind me who he is
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   in charge, and that he works through bosses,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   and that he works through governments,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   and that he works through churches to bring about his will.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   And my job is to do as they've asked,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   as long as it does not dishonor him.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   I pray that you would do the same.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Let me do that now.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Father, help us.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   There is something inside of us
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   that wants to run when we hear the word stop,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   that wants to stop when we hear the word run,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   that wants to flee when we hear the word submit,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   that wants to fight.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   And Lord, we realize now,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   through the reading of your scriptures
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   and the understanding of the things that you have told us to,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   the eternal truths,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   that victory actually comes through surrender,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   that freedom actually comes through submission.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   So Lord, would you help us to find freedom
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   through submission,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   first and foremost to you,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   and then to every human authority that you have put in place,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   that you are actually the authority over.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Lord, we love you, and we trust you.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Help us be free.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Amen.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   It's strange, you know, the Christian faith,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   the God who created the whole world,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   that there's these strange, like, contradictions,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   these weird paradoxes that victory,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   like winning victory,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   would come through surrender.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   That it's like when you come to this place where you're like,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   "I can't. I'm not good enough.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   I'm not fast enough or strong enough or smart enough."
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   But God, I'm your servant,
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   that you find victory then.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   And that freedom, like we have this desire in us
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   to be free, but we look for that,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   we look to fulfill that desire in all the wrong things
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   through our own accomplishments.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   We find self-worth through the things that we do,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   but that real freedom actually comes
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   through tapping out, through surrender.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Through surrender, like, "I can't.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   God, I need your help.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Lord, I'm listening. You speak.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Lord, I'll go. You send.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Father, help me."
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   [silence]
