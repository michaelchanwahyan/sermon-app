[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:25.380]   - Well, here we go, the last week of Datable.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.580]   We are doing it, here we go, Dallas.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.800]   Welcome all of you that are online watching us live,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.420]   all of our PortsLive locations,
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.540]   Northwest Arkansas, North Houston, Scottsdale,
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.700]   Indianapolis, the greater Lafayette of Indiana.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.420]   We see you, welcome.
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.340]   We're glad that you're tuning in with us.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.180]   And of course, I can't forget my friends
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.340]   right here in Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.780]   Welcome, yeah.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.260]   Got a great cheering section right here, I can't wait.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.920]   It's gonna be a great night.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.800]   Well, hey, before we get going,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.100]   by the way, my name is Josiah.
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.040]   I have the privilege of serving on staff here at The Porch,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.240]   but before we get going, I would love just to update you
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.800]   with another friend of ours on staff,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.280]   and that is JD Rogers.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.860]   Many of you know JD, yeah.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.200]   Many of you know JD, he's our creative director
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.260]   here at The Porch, and he also teaches a lot here.
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260]   And today, he underwent a kidney transplant surgery.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.760]   I think we have a picture of him, it'll be up on the screen.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.560]   This is JD, and JD gave his kidney away
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.020]   to a man that was in need of another friend of ours
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.400]   named Ryan, and so as far as we know,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.480]   everything went well, no complications.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.080]   JD and Ryan are recovering, amen.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.240]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.000]   And so I just wanna stop, and I wanna pause,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.480]   and I wanna pray for those two
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.400]   as they're recovering in the hospital this evening.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.640]   Father God, thank you for JD and Ryan.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.120]   Thank you, God, for the incredible news
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.280]   that we received as a team, and now here as a Porch family,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.040]   that the kidney transplant went without any hiccups,
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.680]   without any complications, God,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.960]   that you were right there in the midst of it all.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.000]   Thank you for the incredible picture of the gospel
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.920]   that JD self-sacrificed one of his kidney,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.360]   gave that away for the betterment of Ryan
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.280]   who needed it to live.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.640]   That's a picture of Christ sacrificing his life
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.480]   for us on the cross.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.120]   God, thank you for the incredible opportunity
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.560]   we have to gather in this space to lift up these two.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.320]   I pray that you would heal 'em, in Jesus' name,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.980]   God, that they would recover fully in the hospital,
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.140]   and their story would be told for years to come,
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.760]   and many would come to know you in a personal way,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.740]   and you would receive much, much glory.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.920]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.800]   - Amen.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.520]   - Well, let me start out by taking you back
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.840]   to our childhood, okay?
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.720]   Everyone loves to reminisce maybe of your childhood,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.320]   maybe good memories or bad memories,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.600]   but one of the memories for me specifically
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.400]   that I would do in my childhood was play musical chairs.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.760]   Anyone, any musical chairs?
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.560]   Man, we got some musical chairs fans in the house.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah, so this idea of musical chairs
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.200]   is you have a circle of chairs, and the music's playing,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.160]   and you have one less chair than the contestants playing
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.200]   in the actual game, and they're walking around the chairs,
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.740]   right, and the music's playing in the background,
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.580]   and then all of a sudden, the music stops,
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.120]   and they gotta find a seat as quick as possible.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.580]   And so I thought, maybe we should just play
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.280]   musical chairs tonight, would that be fun?
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.120]   Yeah, so hey, I got a few contestants.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.800]   Why don't y'all come on out here tonight?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.820]   Come on out here, contestants.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.600]   These are some of the contestants tonight.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.800]   Y'all give it up for them.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.440]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.400]   Also known as our porch leaders
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.240]   in the porch black shirt that we know
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.400]   to be a leadership shirt, so we are thankful for y'all.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.760]   Are y'all ready to play musical chairs, yeah?
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   Y'all ready, okay.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.640]   Y'all ready?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.920]   All right, let's have some fun.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.760]   Hit the music.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.220]   Gotta keep walking.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.960]   Maybe a little dancing.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.120]   Okay.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.160]   Whoa, whoa.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.800]   What, we like breaking ankle up here?
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.760]   Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.160]   - What happened there?
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.000]   - I think he was just trying to be respectful,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.680]   wouldn't you say?
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   Yeah, y'all give it up for my man.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.520]   What's your name?
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.360]   - David.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.320]   - David, y'all give it up for David right here.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.720]   He's just trying to be respectful of the ladies.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.200]   So what's going on, man?
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.400]   You're left here all alone without a chair.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.840]   - I knew I didn't like musical chairs as a kid.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.520]   - Yeah, obviously, obviously, right?
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.760]   How do you feel right now?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.560]   - Kind of alone, you know.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.680]   Some would say I'm single up here.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.360]   - He says alone and single up here.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.320]   All right, y'all give it up for the contestants
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.160]   that found the chair.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   Y'all can head off stage and take your chair back
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.800]   'cause you have a chair to take,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.760]   but you on the other hand,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.300]   you don't have a chair to take, bro.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.260]   You're all alone.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.160]   So here's the deal, David, David, David.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.600]   Here's why I start there tonight.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.960]   Because how you feel in this moment playing musical chairs
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.880]   is how I felt for 29 years of my life.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   That I feared, one of my greatest fears,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.840]   that I was gonna be all alone, the music was gonna stop,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.480]   and I was gonna be single without a chair,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.200]   in this case, without a girlfriend, a boyfriend,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.820]   or a future spouse to marry.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.640]   All right, y'all give it up for my man, David.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.800]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.280]   How he felt in that moment,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.680]   how he got left out,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   or he lovingly gave his chair to the woman, right?
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.640]   To the lady, is a picture in some way
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.920]   of my singleness for 29 years of my life.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.640]   That I come into this place
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.240]   and I'm reminiscing about my childhood,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.480]   and in those moments of your childhood,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.720]   you're like, man, I'm all alone, I'm without a chair,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.840]   and everyone's looking at me, and everyone's sitting,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.600]   and everyone's comfortable,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.720]   but then fast forward 20 years of my life,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.460]   my greatest fear is that I would be without a seat
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.960]   in my late 20s, that I would be the token single person,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.400]   that life would go on, and I'd miss my moment
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   to find my chair, and I would be 45 and all alone
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.220]   with no one to date or marry,
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.900]   and the worst part about that is like,
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.060]   man, you get left out, right, and you're watching,
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.060]   everyone found their chair, and you're seeing them
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.580]   sit there, and they're having a good time,
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.940]   they're hanging out, and the music,
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.740]   we all know the music begins to play again,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.300]   and I was thinking about myself at 29,
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.620]   watching the people around me go on dates
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.380]   and have fun and dancing to the music
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.380]   and about to get married,
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.700]   and it left me in a position where,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.340]   did you miss out, God, like, did you forget about me?
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.620]   Did I miss out on my moment?
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.580]   See, that was my story,
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.700]   it might be some of your stories tonight.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.260]   Everyone around me was getting married,
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.240]   except for me, every roommate I had ever had got married
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.180]   or was on the verge of getting married,
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.040]   they were engaged, except for me.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.860]   I found myself at 29, almost 30 years old,
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.860]   laying in bed one night and just kind of doing
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.540]   that ugly cry, like, God, like, where would you,
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.020]   I'm so fed up with this singleness,
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.100]   I don't want anything to do with it anymore,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.200]   God, would you just take it away?
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.060]   And this might be some of you tonight,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.820]   this might be some of your story.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.860]   Like, right now, your friends,
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.600]   maybe your roommates are dating
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.320]   and maybe they're engaged or maybe they're even married.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.280]   And you're asking, God, what about me?
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.060]   Have I missed my moment?
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:58.200]   And you're starting to believe lies from the enemy,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.580]   like, you're single because you're just not fit enough,
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.420]   you're too fat or you're too skinny,
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.420]   or you're single because you got them daddy wounds, right,
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.820]   and you can't trust anybody,
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.980]   or you're single because you're full of anxiety
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.580]   and you're the anxious person who has a hard time
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.940]   being around other people and people don't even
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.580]   really like being around you.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.980]   You're single because you're not rich enough or cool enough,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.240]   or maybe you're believing the lie of,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.560]   man, I'm single because all the good guys
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.120]   and all the good girls, I mean, they're already taken.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.600]   Whispers from the enemy, lies from the enemy.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.240]   And tonight, my hope is that over the next few minutes
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.400]   that you would see three truths from God's word
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.940]   about our singleness, that I would want you to see
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.920]   that your singleness is a gift,
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.380]   that we're single for a reason,
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.180]   and many of you will be relieved to know
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.620]   that you'll only be single for a season.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.740]   And my hope tonight is that you wouldn't believe
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.700]   that God is trying to hold out on you
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.420]   or God's trying to rip you off
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.900]   or God's trying to give you something that's second best,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.680]   but that you would see that you are a gift to the kingdom
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.480]   and you are a gift to the church
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.700]   right where you are in your singleness.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.300]   You're not any less than a person if you're single
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.940]   or dating or even married.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.020]   We're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 7 tonight.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.860]   If you have your Bibles,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.920]   you can open it up to 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.900]   If I could sum up this book in one statement,
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.020]   it'd be like the church gone wild.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.860]   I mean, they're doing some crazy stuff, y'all.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.360]   Y'all should read 1 Corinthians at some point.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.720]   Like one dude is like sleeping with his mom.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.320]   Like, I mean it, like it's crazy.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.700]   Like they're full of prostitution, sex,
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.300]   drunkenness, idols, division.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.540]   Like men are going out with prostitutes.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.460]   Like people are going to the church
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.060]   and getting drunk at communion.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.180]   Like they're even trying to find the party in the church.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.940]   Like it's some crazy stuff going on there.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.820]   And Paul, this guy who's been radically changed by God
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.420]   who used to persecute Christians,
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.460]   this guy named Paul has a heavy task
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.740]   that God has given him in writing to this church in Corinth,
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.060]   the believers in Corinth, pertaining to these issues,
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.420]   not only to the church in Corinth,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.780]   but 2,000 years later, right here at the porch,
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.860]   Dallas and all across the nation.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.620]   So tonight we're gonna address the question.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.180]   It's the question that Paul addressed back then
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.060]   in 1 Corinthians 7, why are you single?
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.320]   Why are you single?
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.980]   Starting in verse six, this is what Paul says.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.140]   He says, I say this as a concession, not as a command.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.100]   So this isn't like a command from God,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.820]   but this is just like something that maybe you would yield
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.460]   to because it's good wisdom, okay?
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.660]   What is he about to say that it's not a command,
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.460]   but it's maybe just good advice.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.300]   He says in verse seven,
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.340]   but I wish everyone were single just as I am.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.140]   Paul, that's not what I wanted to hear, okay?
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.640]   Like that's the last thing I wanted to hear, bro.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.960]   He goes on and says, and yet each person
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.380]   has a special gift from God of one kind or another.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.940]   In other words, you're single, that's a gift.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.620]   You're married, that's a gift.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.720]   So I say to those who aren't married and to widows,
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.460]   it is better to stay unmarried just as I am.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.740]   So again, whether you're married or you're single,
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.540]   God's got a gift.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.020]   He sees this as a gift.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.140]   First point, if you're taking notes tonight,
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.200]   is singleness is a gift.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.940]   Singleness is a gift.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.660]   And you're probably like rolling your eyes right now
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.240]   and saying like, I don't wanna hear
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.200]   that singleness is a gift, Josiah.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.980]   But here, if I'm gonna accurately teach the text,
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.860]   I got to share this, okay?
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.180]   So stay with me.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.500]   Those of you that are rolling
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.740]   and don't wanna hear anymore,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.340]   right out of the gate, Paul hits us with this simple,
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.940]   but profound truth that he has a gift
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.100]   and that gift is singleness.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.060]   Now the word in Greek for gift is charisma.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.980]   It's where we get the English word charity.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.060]   It literally is translated grace from God.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.300]   And so he's like, man, Josiah, have you not heard?
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.020]   Like, I don't want you to talk to me
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.960]   about my singleness being grace from God.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.600]   It feels nothing like grace.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.560]   It feels like a curse, bro.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.100]   Like, come on.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.100]   But as Paul continues, he's trying to point out
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.320]   that there's a gift here.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.380]   And he's gonna elaborate on it in the rest of the verses
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.020]   why he would say that this is a gift.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.720]   But before we get there, I know this is hard.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.560]   Like, let me just empathize with you for a second.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.920]   I know this is hard for you to hear
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.200]   because many of us, if statistics are right,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Barna would say, Barna Research Group would say
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.060]   96% of singles long to be married at some point.
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.620]   So there's only about 4% that just say,
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.980]   hey, I don't want a significant other.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.780]   Let me ask you, have you ever received a gift
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:11.840]   that you didn't want?
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.040]   In just a few short weeks, I couldn't believe it.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.200]   Like, I think it's like, I mean, Christmas
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.040]   is right around the corner.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.720]   I mean, I know I don't wanna skip Thanksgiving, right?
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.160]   But Christmas is right around the corner
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   in just a few short weeks.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.000]   We're gonna be celebrating Christmas.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.240]   Last week, our porch staff, last week, last year,
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.600]   our porch staff got together and we had a party
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.480]   with some of our team leads that serve here at the porch.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.140]   And we had a white elephant gift exchange.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.860]   Ever done one of those, yeah?
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.600]   So we go around and we draw numbers
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.960]   and I kinda had the tail end.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.160]   I was like nine or 10.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.680]   And man, my time finally came where I was gonna
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.920]   find my gift and I was gonna unpack it
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.200]   and lo and behold, I grabbed my gift and I unpack it.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.400]   And it's a mouse, y'all.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.920]   Like, it's a mouse.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.520]   Like, I don't do rodents, much less a mouse, a pet mouse.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.400]   And I'm looking at the person that gave it.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.240]   I'm like, you gave this?
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.280]   Like, I'm starting to question your integrity.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.360]   I'm starting to question your, you know,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.000]   I'm starting to question whether I can trust you
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.640]   and you're a leader at the porch.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.040]   And the whole time, I was just like,
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.000]   man, this is gross, y'all, man, this is,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.160]   I'm not taking this home, man.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.720]   Like, I will pay you to take it back.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.760]   Like, I will give you money.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.000]   Like, I'm bargaining, I'm like,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.840]   hey, this is a pet mouse, kinda cool.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.440]   I mean, there's something I think you could do with it.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.560]   Maybe you can feed it to your pet snake, right?
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.460]   'Cause that's about all it's good for.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.340]   Right, amen?
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.160]   Yeah, I don't know any people that like pet mouse.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.400]   Like, I can't even say it.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.780]   It's like, get that out of my language.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.840]   But the reason why I share that with you
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.720]   is because that's a picture of some of you
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.120]   in what you do with your singleness.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.460]   You're like, man, it's gross.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.360]   Like, I don't wanna talk about it.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.780]   That's like the dirty word in the church
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.960]   that we talk about sometimes when there's dating series.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.640]   Like, I don't want nothing to do with that.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.080]   Like, I'm trying to give it away.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.340]   Like, I'm trying to lose it, not use it.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.960]   Like, I will pay some people to take my singleness.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.480]   Some of you conniving right now.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.320]   It's like, what can I do?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.720]   Like, get rid of my singleness, right?
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.320]   And I think this is just a picture
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   of sometimes what we do with our singleness.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.280]   And the entire time, God is saying,
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.680]   hey, singleness is a gift,
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.520]   and you're called the steward to get this gift.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.320]   But now there's another group of people
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.920]   that came into the room tonight.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.180]   Let me talk to this group for a second.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.260]   There's people, mainly men,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260]   that came into this group, this room tonight.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.180]   And you're like, man, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.860]   I just said I love my singleness.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.420]   Like, it's awesome.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.620]   And you don't love it because you can serve God more.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.820]   You don't love it so that you can, you know,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.940]   make much of his name.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.780]   You love it because you can make, you know,
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.580]   much of your name.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.140]   And you're abusing your singleness at the expense of women.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.900]   - Say that.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.400]   - Amen.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.440]   Like, you're dragging their hearts through the mud.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.360]   You're going from one woman to the next,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.740]   and you're preying on the women that come here to the porch.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:35.760]   Like, you know some Bible verses,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.280]   but you use those Bible verses to manipulate women
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.100]   to get what you want, you know what I'm saying?
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.160]   Oh, now I'm meddling.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.380]   Or you got a Bible, you even got a Bible,
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.840]   and you carry that Bible with you.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.740]   You got that cross necklace that you wear around your neck.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.440]   And you know what the Bible would say about you
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.540]   is that you're a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:04.660]   I'm not done.
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.120]   I'm not done.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.220]   And let me tell you something.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.760]   We see you, and we train up our leaders to see you,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.000]   and we will find you, and we will expose you.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.240]   And let me tell you something, ladies.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.260]   Let me hit you for a second.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.820]   Let me hit you for a second.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.360]   Listen, ladies, ladies, ladies.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.940]   Just because he calls himself a Christian
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.080]   doesn't mean he's a Christian.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.000]   Just because he knows a few verses or carries a Bible
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   or got a cross tattoo of John 3:16 even,
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.900]   I'm just trying to keep it real.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.940]   Is that okay tonight?
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.140]   Doesn't mean that he's authentic, man.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.500]   He's a wolf.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.700]   And so what do you do?
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.700]   You observe him over a period of time,
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.380]   because here's what I know.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.600]   The greatest test is time,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.980]   that you would observe someone.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.900]   You would watch them in circles of friends or people,
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.620]   and you would see what they do, because, hey, listen,
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.140]   they might be able to front you for a season,
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.900]   but they can't front forever.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.380]   And you ask, you check the resources,
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.380]   you check the people around, and you ask about the person.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.740]   The greatest test is time.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.080]   Sorry, I digressed.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.200]   (laughing)
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.320]   Some of you are asking, "Josiah,
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.000]   "how do I know if I have the gift of singleness?"
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.520]   This is how you know if you have the gift of singleness.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.920]   Did you walk in here single?
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.440]   You got the gift of singleness.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.420]   Congratulations.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.280]   And-- - I love it!
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.600]   - And I-- (laughing)
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.760]   I can always count on this guy every week
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.120]   to just keep it light and keep it fun.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.400]   But here's the deal.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.340]   Listen, listen.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:10.260]   I know that sounds harsh, but what do we do with any gift?
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.360]   You have athleticism, you have good looks,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.660]   you have success in corporate.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.340]   You steward that gift for the glory of God.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.220]   You take that gift and you tell that gift the passion.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.580]   The passion is that you are created in the image of God
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.580]   to bear his image, that you would make much of his name,
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.300]   and anything you do or anything he's entrusted you with,
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.100]   and you're like, "Man, I don't wanna be entrusted
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.940]   "with singleness."
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.900]   Do you think I wanna be entrusted with singleness
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:40.900]   at 29 years old?
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.780]   No, I didn't.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.500]   But I couldn't shake this passage.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.180]   I couldn't shake 1 Corinthians 7
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:52.180]   when Paul is sitting here trying the best he can
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.600]   through the spirit of God and saying,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.660]   "Hey, your singleness is a gift."
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.060]   Now, that's from God.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.740]   The whole, "Hey, I wish you were single,"
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.980]   is not, that's not a command.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.820]   That's just Paul just saying,
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.940]   "Hey, I think it'd be good for you to be single,"
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.740]   and he's about to tell us why.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.700]   But what do you do when you've been given a gift?
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.700]   You steward it for the glory of God, for the good of others,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.540]   and when you do that, you will find much, much joy.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.100]   I hope you'll see that tonight.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.500]   Just this past week, I was talking to some new friends
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.500]   on staff that we just hired, Becca and Alexia.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.860]   And yeah, they're awesome, awesome women of God.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.480]   But what's so cool, I was getting to know their story,
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.060]   and they went on to say Becca was from Florida,
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.620]   and she had family, and she had friends there,
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.940]   and she was about to take a job in corporate,
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.260]   making six figures, and she came here
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.440]   to be a content coordinator, a content person
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.820]   that really knows how to organize what you see
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.880]   on social media, and plan things,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.220]   and just, she's got incredible gifts,
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.760]   but she was gonna make six figures
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.800]   doing something along those lines.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.320]   And God arrested her heart and said,
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.740]   "Hey, I think I'm calling you to pick up your comfort
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.460]   "and your convenience, and what you would have in Florida,
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.840]   "and I'm calling you to leave all of that,
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.640]   "to come to Dallas, a place," she said,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.580]   she's never, I'm like, "Bro, you ain't been to Dallas before?
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.040]   "We gotta get you out, right?"
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.160]   But no, she's like, "Florida's the best."
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.520]   Cool, I trust that.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.200]   But she left, and I was thinking to myself,
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.080]   is she any less complete?
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.520]   She happened to be single, too.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.240]   Alexia, she came from Seattle, Washington.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.120]   I looked it up, 30 plus hours, over 2,000 miles.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.440]   To come on staff and be a graphic designer,
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.840]   a videographer, content creator,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.820]   what you see, you're gonna be seeing some incredible work
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.560]   on social media for the glory of God.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.280]   And I'm like, man, I look at these women,
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.480]   I'm like, goodness gracious,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.980]   are they any less complete because they're single?
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:20.280]   No, if anything, they might even be more complete.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.180]   They're doing things like maybe I could never have done
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.540]   as now a married man, and just pick up and leave.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.300]   They're not distracted by a husband
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.740]   or in desperate need of one.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.740]   If the Lord entrusts them with, this is what they say,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.060]   if the Lord entrusts them with one,
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.620]   then they would steward that gift.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.500]   But I was just so impressed, like, listening to their story
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.380]   and watching how they were hearing from God
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.180]   and pursuing Him, and they made the decision
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.940]   to come on staff and to leverage their gifts
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.980]   for the glory of God.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.980]   What are they doing, man?
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   They're choosing to use their singleness as a gift,
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:06.740]   not trying to lose it, but to use it.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:11.100]   Tonight, let me ask you something.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.220]   Do you see your singleness as a gift to use
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.380]   or a gift to lose?
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.360]   Do you see that God, in all of His sovereignty,
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.700]   has put you in Dallas, Texas, that the job you have
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.820]   and the apartment complex you live in,
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.180]   the neighborhood that you're in,
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.540]   the cubicle that you office at,
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.380]   so that you would make much of Him in these years
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.140]   that you might never get back, called your singleness.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.560]   Singleness is a gift.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.780]   Point number two, if you're taking notes,
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.060]   singleness for a reason.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.660]   Singleness for a reason.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.140]   He says this, Paul says,
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.780]   "I want you to be free from anxieties.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.740]   "The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord,
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.220]   "how to please the Lord.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.900]   "But the married man is anxious about worldly things,
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.500]   "how to please his wife, and his interests are divided.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.620]   "An unmarried man or betrothed woman is anxious
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.780]   "about the things of the Lord, how to be holy
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.860]   "in body and spirit, but the married woman
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.900]   "is anxious about worldly things,
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.300]   "how to please her husband."
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.760]   Verse 35, "I say this for your own benefit,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.020]   "not to put restraint on you."
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.380]   I'm not trying to restrict you from getting married,
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.180]   but I'm just trying to let you know ahead of time,
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.620]   I'm trying to give you a greater vision of your singleness,
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.580]   a greater vision of a future
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.260]   that would affect your present reality.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.100]   Like many of you, did you hear me?
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.740]   You're gonna probably get married,
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.320]   we're gonna get there here in a second,
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.380]   but you have this moment in your life,
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.460]   you have this period of time that you can use
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.180]   where you're gonna be less distracted.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:59.300]   And so, he goes on and says, "I say this for your benefit,
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.020]   "not to put restrictions on you,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.540]   "but to promote what is appropriate,"
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.540]   and I love this last part,
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.320]   "and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.760]   "I want you to do whatever will help you
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.100]   "serve the Lord the best
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.740]   "with as few distractions as possible."
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.060]   See, God is purposeful, and all that he does,
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.580]   don't miss this, you're single for a reason.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.620]   You know what that reason is?
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.980]   So you can focus on Jesus
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.020]   with minimal distractions as possible.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.140]   Like, here's where this old,
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.540]   this married thing comes into play.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.700]   You're like, "Oh, here's a married guy."
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.520]   Let me just tell you about his last 24 hours.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.280]   Speaking of myself, okay.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.320]   Yesterday I woke up, yesterday morning I woke up,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.120]   and it was my wife's birthday, her name's Kathy.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.280]   And we just had an incredible morning,
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.900]   woke up early 'cause I went off to write this message,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.980]   but here we are on the 'Gram,
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.980]   celebrating 37 years of life, right?
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.280]   And this is my family, Camille, the oldest,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   and then Isabella, she's three, Camille's four,
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.600]   and I have little Caleb right there, seven months,
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.960]   and then our babysitter, she came by to give a coffee,
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.160]   so I was like, "Jump into the picture, let's go."
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   But, you know, that was probably
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.160]   the one shining spot light of the whole day.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.020]   I went off to write my message,
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.440]   and shortly into my message I get a text
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.320]   from my sister saying, "Hey, Mom's gotten in a car accident
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.360]   "on Highway 30, she got rear-ended,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.480]   "and the guy doesn't have insurance."
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.120]   So I'm like, "All right, here we go.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.560]   "What do we do for you, let me help Mom out."
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.640]   My mom's single, parents divorced when I was young,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.860]   so it makes things complicated.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.620]   Go back to writing, make sure Mom is okay,
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.680]   go back to writing.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.140]   Then I get a text from my wife, she's like,
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.480]   "Oh, Josiah, I don't know what to do.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.600]   "Kids are acting crazy, they're hitting each other,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.920]   "they're screaming, you know, one of 'em scratched,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.600]   "we got blood pouring out."
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.440]   I mean, just like, "What's going on?
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.600]   "You're gonna have to give spankings when they come home."
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.360]   I'm like, "All right, go back to writing."
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.960]   Wrap up the writing.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.240]   No joke, y'all, I walk into my house.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.160]   My little girl, three years old,
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.040]   is literally crying all over the floor,
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.800]   flailing her arms, can't stop.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.320]   My wife's got the seven-month-old Caleb,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.800]   and she's like, "Hey, just to remind you,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.100]   "we're leading a Bible study tonight for newly-marrieds.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.400]   "Who plans a Bible study for newly-marrieds
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.560]   "on their wife's birthday?"
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.080]   Now I feel like I'm the best husband in the world.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.480]   Right now I'm being, I mean, like,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.400]   I didn't even see that coming,
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.880]   and she's like, "Why would you do that?"
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.020]   I'm like, "I don't know, I should've said something,
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.160]   "I should've raised my hand."
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.720]   And then she's like, "Hey, we don't even have dinner made,
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.480]   "so I'm gonna go get dinner, I'm gonna get takeout."
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.320]   I'm like, "All right, go."
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.640]   She gives me my seven-month-old Caleb.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.360]   At that time, he projectile vomits all over the floor.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.560]   And I'm just like, "Man, I can't even be mad,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.680]   "that's impressive, I didn't know that much bodily fluid."
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.120]   Bodily fluid could come out of a seven-month-old.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:14.160]   About that time, I get a call from one of our porch leaders,
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.460]   and I'm like, "I'm just gonna FaceTime this
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.760]   "so he can just see all the chaos,"
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.600]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.120]   Like, I gotta give spankings, I gotta clean up vomit,
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.100]   I got scratches, I gotta break up fights,
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.620]   so we FaceTime, I'm like, "Hey, what's up, Kyle?
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.920]   "This is what's going on, bro."
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.320]   I'm like, "Hey, man, what are you doing?"
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.720]   He's like, "Oh, bro, man, I'm hanging out with my roommate,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.560]   "we're getting some food,
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.720]   "we're about to watch the Cowboys game."
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.240]   I said, "Great, man, have a nice night,
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.800]   "enjoy your singleness."
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.280]   (audience laughs)
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.460]   Hung up the phone.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.440]   You kidding me, bro?
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   Listen, man, I don't...
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.480]   I'm done.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:58.920]   But listen, I don't say that for sympathy, I really don't.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.440]   I say that because of what the Texas,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.520]   what Paul is trying to communicate
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.840]   through the Spirit of God in this text.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.600]   I share this because what Paul is saying is true.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.040]   Like, you don't have less problems in marriage,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.660]   you have more problems, more stressors, more anxieties,
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.000]   more things to worry about.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.360]   And I think what he's trying to communicate
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.500]   is when you get married, you just double your problems.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.280]   Like, there's single problems,
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.120]   and I don't wanna minimize,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.760]   that's what's hard in this room.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.280]   I know there's hard things that y'all are going through.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.800]   I'm not trying to minimize your problems.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.360]   You have incredibly difficult stressors
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.160]   in your life right now, and we wanna minister to those.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.060]   But what I wanna communicate
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.400]   in the most loving, careful way possible
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.360]   is notice how I didn't post any of those stressors
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.440]   on my 'gram.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.360]   Oh, here's throw up.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Here's blood.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.320]   I'm trying to communicate in the same way that Paul is,
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.520]   that Paul is saying, "Hey, marriage doesn't fix your problems
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.680]   "it only adds to your problems."
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.280]   God is trying to convince you of something
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.680]   that I know is really hard to believe
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.680]   because it was for me when I heard this.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.860]   My mid-20s, nearing the end of my 20s.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.200]   There are problems in singleness
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.880]   and there's problems in marriage.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.640]   It's a good thing, but you're choosing to double them.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.960]   I'm not trying to talk you out of marriage,
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.440]   but I am trying to exposit the text.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.840]   I'm trying to be faithful to what God's word has to say
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.220]   in 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.320]   And he's saying, "Hey, you have a season of life
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.480]   "that I'm placing you in
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.260]   "where you're gonna have minimal distractions,
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.800]   "or you're gonna have less distractions,
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.260]   "you're gonna have less problems,
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.960]   "you're gonna have less stressors
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:51.440]   "than you'll ever have before in your life."
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.840]   And hearing all of this, some of you are like,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.780]   "Man, I get that you have more problems,
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.960]   "but I'd rather trade my problems for your problems,
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.720]   "Jessi, at least you got a companion and all.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.560]   "At least you get to have sex, you know what I'm saying?
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.940]   "Look at them kids."
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.180]   But here's the reality, we just got real.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.280]   And they're all under five.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.680]   But here's the reality.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.080]   You might say, "Hey, I'd rather have your problems,
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.340]   "I'd rather trade your problems for my problems."
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.040]   But here's the reality, you can't.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.860]   So why wouldn't you use this season of singleness
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.180]   that God's got you in
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:45.060]   for an incredible
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:51.100]   way of saying, "God, I wanna make much of you,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.700]   "I wanna use the extra time,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.200]   "I wanna use the extra income,
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.040]   "I wanna use the gifts that you've given me,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.060]   "and I wanna leverage those for your glory."
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.840]   Why would you not try to do that
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.700]   during this time of singleness?
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.180]   Like you see, before Christ,
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.900]   I wasted so many years of my singleness.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.360]   Like I wish I could stand up here and authentically say,
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.820]   "Man, I leveraged it all, man, I went all in."
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.740]   But the truth is, I wasted all of my college years,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.580]   pretty much,
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.320]   chasing the party, chasing one relationship after another.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.020]   I was the man praying on women.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.100]   I was that guy.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.000]   I was the porn addict.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.120]   I was thinking I was gonna find fulfillment and rest
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.900]   in my sport that I played,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.760]   in the fame that I got, in the affirmation that I received.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.460]   And it came to a screeching halt one night.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.180]   My sin was ruling my life.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.440]   It finally caught up with me.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.680]   I chased all these things, even pornography,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.000]   for a decade of my life for a cheap thrill and a fill
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.480]   that only led to greater levels of anxiety and depression.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.760]   Alcohol was my escape,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.880]   and I began to become so unsatisfied
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.320]   and unfulfilled with those things.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.320]   And I always tell people,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.800]   "Hey, you won't really see your need for Christ
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.480]   "until you see how wicked your sin is
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.720]   "in light of a holy God, a perfect God."
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.120]   Like, some of you come into this place
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.680]   and you just justify your sin,
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.280]   and you're like, "Oh, I'm good, man.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.440]   "Like, I got God here on Tuesdays,
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.160]   "but then every other day, man,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.240]   "I'm just doing what I wanna do.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.880]   "But I'll give 'em a little bit on Tuesday night."
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.000]   And you're miserable, man.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.640]   Deep down inside, you're miserable,
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   because you can't have the world and Christ at the same time.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.200]   They're two competing.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.360]   They're oppositions.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.040]   You can have Jesus or the world, but you can't have both.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.640]   And I realized for the first time,
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.880]   my eyes were opened to the fact
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.200]   that Jesus got what I deserved on the cross,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.920]   and I got what he deserved, death.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.840]   (silence)
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.920]   Thankfully, the Lord captured my heart at the end of college
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.920]   and I began to give my life away,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.120]   and that's really when I began to find life.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.960]   I almost left the game that I loved
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.400]   for so many years, baseball,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.720]   and God said, "No, no, no, you take that game
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.000]   "and you tell that game your passion.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.280]   "Your passion is me."
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.440]   (silence)
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.960]   See, God loves passions.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.440]   He's not against your passions.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.600]   He's not against your desires,
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.480]   but you need to start telling your passions its purpose.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.000]   Your purpose is Christ.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Your purpose is to make him known
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.960]   in any and everything you do.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:06.400]   So, can I charge you for a second?
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.680]   Like, in this season,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.960]   that God's got you, like you're single for a reason,
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.920]   because he says, "Hey, you can go.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.600]   "You can move halfway across the country
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.120]   "if God's calling you to take a job.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.440]   "You can go on a mission trip
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.840]   "and go share the gospel with people
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.560]   "that have never heard the name of Jesus.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.200]   "Like, tomorrow morning, when you get into that office,
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.000]   "like, you should try to lose your job
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.240]   "for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.360]   "with people that don't know him.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   "Like, you should get plugged in.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.240]   "I mean, plugged into the local church.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.600]   "Like, you should submit yourself
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.000]   "under the authority of the elders
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.480]   "and say, 'Hey, I'm going all in.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.440]   "'I'm changing my playground and my playmates.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.440]   "'Enough of this.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.200]   "'I'm tired of going and hanging out
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.360]   "'on the same playgrounds.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.200]   "'Like, I am going to find men that love Jesus.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.280]   "'I'm gonna go find women.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.840]   "'Like, I'm telling you, these women,
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   "'I'm gonna find them,
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.460]   "'and they're gonna be women that go all in,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.600]   "'and they're not just gonna have one foot in the world
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.280]   "'and one foot in the church.'"
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:06.120]   God's got that for you tonight, you know that?
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.840]   God's speaking to you tonight and he's saying,
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:15.000]   "Hey, don't waste these years that I'm gonna give you.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.440]   "That you would bring glory to my kingdom,
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.040]   "that you would live for another kingdom,
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.800]   "that you wouldn't treat God as something
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.120]   "that you just add onto your life,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.520]   "but you would treat him as the biggest thing in your life."
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.880]   Man, could I tell you about
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   a guy named Kyle, I'm close to him.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.720]   He serves here at the porch.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.280]   He went to SMU, played football,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.120]   chasing everything underneath the sun.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.640]   God radically changed his heart.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.520]   God flipped it upside down.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.600]   He was chasing corporate, wanted to be a millionaire.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.460]   By the time he was 30, and God just said,
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.640]   "Hey, no, no, you're gonna,
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.240]   "I know that's a passion of yours.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.560]   "Nothing wrong with that in and of itself,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.520]   "but hey, you can't even be a Christian right now
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.080]   "because you're allowing that to consume you."
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.800]   And he began to change Kyle's heart.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.720]   And now he's leading a team here at the porch
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.640]   every single week, right down here.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.720]   It's called the Sidewalk Team.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.880]   They share the gospel with people.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.280]   They pray with people right after service.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.140]   Can I tell you about a woman named Melissa
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.340]   who had an abortion?
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.720]   That's part of her story.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.480]   And she's leading a team out in the town center,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.420]   the lobby, every week here at the porch.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.800]   Like, your past doesn't have to define you
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.320]   because Jesus says, "Hey, I can define you now."
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.580]   Melissa is an incredible example of a girl
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.460]   that went all in with everything underneath the sun
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.640]   only to find greater levels of anxiety and depression.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.020]   And listen, it's like some of you tonight,
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.560]   like, you're gonna get creative.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.980]   Like, you're gonna go out of here
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.660]   and you're gonna be like, "Yeah, man, I'm gonna go all in.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.820]   "Like, I'm gonna sign up for a community group.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.020]   "I'm gonna be a member of a church.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.460]   "I'm gonna go equip disciple.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.700]   "I'm gonna leverage these years.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.700]   "I'm going all in.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.980]   "I'm gonna figure out how to share the message of Christ
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.760]   "in the most tactful way possible,
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.100]   "and I am going in, all in."
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:09.400]   And you're gonna get creative
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.320]   in how you can bring God's name to your office.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.200]   Others of you, man, you're gonna leave this room tonight.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.000]   Tomorrow's gonna come, and you're gonna waste
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.740]   your singleness by focusing all the attention on you.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.220]   You're gonna impulse buy clothes
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.440]   or another trinket that you really can't afford.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.400]   You're gonna go out and binge eat
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.700]   because you feel like your life is out of control
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.040]   and that's the only thing that you can control.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.400]   You're gonna binge watch Netflix,
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.060]   or you're gonna binge watch Bravo and Real Housewives,
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.280]   nothing against that, right, but it's consuming you
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.060]   and you're living in some fantasy world.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.400]   You're gonna do these things
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.520]   thinking that they're gonna give you life,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.780]   and they're just leading to emptiness.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.980]   Like, you, man, you're gonna pull up
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.800]   a two-dimensional image tonight on your phone.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.860]   Because it's your only escape, you think.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.040]   I thought that, that was a lie I believed.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.200]   It's your only escape of leaving the pain of loneliness.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.940]   And it might feel good in the moment,
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.940]   but you're not, it's not doing anything for you.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:20.320]   It's leading to emptiness, and you know it.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.660]   You lay in bed at night saying,
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.000]   "Is this all that there is, is this it?"
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.360]   And God's trying to give you a perspective tonight.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.700]   Unless you see a different perspective,
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.160]   unless you see that, hey, there's more to this life
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.000]   than what you're doing now.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.920]   Listen, you are going to die a miserable person.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.660]   Why do you think LA, Hollywood,
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.280]   is the most miserable place on the Earth?
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.520]   Come on, you know that.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.780]   It's fake, bro.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.800]   See your singleness as a gift.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.020]   See your singleness for a reason.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.320]   And third and final point tonight is this.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.600]   See your singleness for a season.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.680]   Like if you didn't know, most of you will be relieved
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.960]   to know that your singleness has an expiration date,
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.800]   so you can exhale now.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:10.340]   Demographers, is that how you say that, demographer, yeah,
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.100]   project that 80% of Americans will be married
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.480]   at some point in their lives.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.400]   And I know what you're thinking, I'm going to be the 20%.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.160]   Get that negative feedback out of here, right?
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.160]   Just get it out of here.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.160]   Brides.com said according to the 2018 statistic,
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.320]   the average age at which women get married is almost 28.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.200]   There's hope.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.720]   For some, the average age is 29.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.560]   In my case, it was 31.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:44.240]   If most of us see singleness for a season,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:51.040]   which I hope you do, hope that gives hope,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.280]   then what should you do in this season?
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.600]   Can I challenge you with two things and then we'll close?
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.080]   The same thing that I was challenged with
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.500]   is that you would see this season
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.340]   where you would choose two things,
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.380]   and there's a lot of other things you can choose,
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.420]   but you would choose contentment
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.620]   and you would choose purity.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.460]   Here's why I say that.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.560]   Let me talk about contentment first.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.800]   Philippians 4, 11 through 13, same guy, Paul, says this,
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.840]   and he says, "I've found the secret to contentment."
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.680]   Look what he says.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.760]   "I've learned how to be content with whatever I have.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.160]   "Whether I know how to live on almost nothing
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.920]   "or with everything, I've learned the secret
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.600]   "of living in every situation,
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.480]   "whether it's on a full stomach or empty,
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.960]   "with plenty or little."
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.200]   Listen, I know this is a coffee cup verse,
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.080]   it's a tattoo verse, but here, don't miss it.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.880]   "For I can do everything through Christ
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.880]   "who gives me strength."
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.720]   You can replace that word strength with satisfaction.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.880]   "I can do everything through Christ who satisfies me,
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.120]   "who gives me contentment."
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.520]   Paul's saying, "Hey, I've learned the secret to contentment
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   "and it's by me learning how to build
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.560]   "contentment in Christ."
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.800]   And some of us, man, we take this verse
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.840]   and we tack it on to selfish gain.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.480]   And in the context of this passage,
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.520]   he's talking about contentment.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.600]   He's not talking about your bench press.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.960]   He's not talking about you making a million dollars
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.800]   by the time you're 30.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.320]   He's not talking about you getting a spouse
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.340]   or getting a girlfriend or going on a date
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.400]   or not being single the next Valentine's Day
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.240]   that comes along.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.840]   He's talking about, he's like,
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.720]   "I've learned the secret of facing little
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.520]   "or abounding and having everything."
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.360]   You know what the secret is?
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.800]   Putting my faith in Jesus.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.960]   Putting my trust in Him.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.280]   Why is being content so important in your singleness?
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.680]   Because here's what I know.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.160]   Where there's a lack of contentment,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.440]   there's a lack of conviction.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.940]   And where there's a lack of conviction,
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.480]   there's always a willingness to settle
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.540]   for less than God's best.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.260]   Some of you tonight, listen,
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.100]   some of you tonight,
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.500]   you're settling for less than God's best.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.740]   You're dating that person that you know you shouldn't date.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.800]   You're going on these dates with guys
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.740]   that man, their profiles are saying that they're Christian,
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.140]   but you know they're far from it.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.140]   Like you're settling.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.540]   The conviction is a belief.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.020]   When there's a lack of contentment in our life,
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.420]   there's a lack of belief.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.740]   There's a lack of trust in God.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.300]   And where there's a lack of trust in God,
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.340]   you're always gonna be willing to settle
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.480]   for less than his best.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.880]   And I don't want that for you, Porch.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.840]   I don't want that for you tonight.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.820]   I want you to experience all that God would have for you.
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.560]   The lie is Jesus isn't enough,
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.280]   and that's such a lie.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.640]   So the question I, it begs tonight,
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.800]   is how do we build contentment?
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.560]   Listen, we build contentment
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.720]   by actually living out our faith.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.080]   Like I just implored you in the last truth,
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.180]   like some of us, man, we're not living out our faith.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.440]   You wake up and you don't spend time with God.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.400]   You don't talk to God.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.000]   You don't get in his word.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.500]   You don't allow this to wash over.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.160]   You don't allow this to renew your mind.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.860]   How do you expect to build contentment in your life
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.080]   when this isn't true?
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.840]   How do you build contentment?
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.440]   You read, man, you study the Bible.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.160]   You get with men and women that love Jesus.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.400]   You follow someone who's following Christ.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.480]   Find the most godliest man or godliest woman
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.120]   and say, hey, will you mentor me?
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.140]   Will you disciple me?
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.460]   Can I learn from you?
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.880]   That's what I did when I was 20,
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.160]   two years old after I came to know Jesus.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.560]   You confess sin.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.320]   You pursue healing from addiction.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.200]   Some of us tonight, man, we have to go to Regen.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.760]   Like it's a recovery ministry.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.120]   I'm thinking about going through it next year
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.520]   when I can free up some time.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.920]   When I'm not a man of divided heart,
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.720]   I wish I could do it now.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.240]   Monday nights, every Monday night,
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.880]   there's about 1,000 people that show up here
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.020]   and we all got issues.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.900]   We all got baggage.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.120]   We all got things that we need to work through.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.080]   And the healthiest thing that you could do right now
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.480]   in your singleness is to get healthy,
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   is to learn what it looks like to confess sin,
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.960]   to pursue Christ, to flee sexual immorality,
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.400]   drunkenness, drugs, anything that would take your eyes
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.240]   off of Jesus.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.200]   Philip Zimbardo, I love this,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.680]   chair of the Western Psychological Foundation.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.560]   He wrote a book called "The Demise of Guys."
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.880]   So you listen up, man.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.140]   We reported that the average guy, by the time they're 21,
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.440]   has spent 10,000 hours playing video games.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.360]   10,000 hours.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.400]   It takes half that time to earn a bachelor's degree.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.960]   Listen, it's not about video games.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.400]   I don't care if you don't play video,
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.520]   go play video games.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.080]   But if it's consuming your life,
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.720]   then I wonder if you're missing a bigger purpose.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.480]   The world is on fire, man.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.400]   You understand?
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.280]   Like it's burning all around us.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.800]   Crippling levels of poverty.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.200]   Injustice is taking place.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.920]   Addiction all over this country.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.480]   And you're sitting behind a screen,
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.680]   twiddling your thumbs,
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:02.040]   thinking that you're gonna find purpose and satisfaction
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.540]   in beating some silly game.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:07.540]   Sex slavery.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:13.540]   God is looking for men to step up
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.660]   and to run to the fire and say, "I got hope.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.220]   "His name is Jesus.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.300]   "Where are the men?
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.160]   "Stand up.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.440]   "Let's go.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.980]   "The time is now.
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.700]   "Right now in our singleness."
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.180]   Could it be that we're discontent
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.620]   because the things of Christ are not really
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.900]   true in your life?
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.420]   Could it be that the reason why you go to bed,
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:46.180]   you're miserable because you're the weakened warrior,
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.620]   the porn, you're the Tinder hookups,
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.740]   you're the workaholic, you're uncommitted relationship,
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.260]   you're playing house with your girlfriend,
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.300]   you're half-heartedly doing this church thing,
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.060]   could it be that you're not,
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.360]   it's because you're not all in?
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.420]   Tonight's the night.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.020]   Jesus wants to build contentment
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.460]   because he knows if you don't ever learn
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.660]   to be content in him,
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.700]   then if you were to get married,
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.300]   your spouse is gonna let you down, man.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.460]   Spouses make miserable saviors.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.220]   Like I wish I could say I meet
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.620]   every one of my wife's expectations.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.660]   I wish she could say that, right?
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.420]   But it's not true, man.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.720]   And so what do you do?
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.540]   What do others do when spouses
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.260]   don't meet their expectations?
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.740]   They run to some drug.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.780]   They run to some strip club.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.040]   They run to some illegitimate relationship.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.260]   Why do you think the divorce rate is on all-time high?
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.740]   Because men and women haven't learned
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.340]   to be content in their creator.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.880]   Amen?
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.000]   Lastly, choose purity.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.200]   Why pursue purity?
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.780]   Why pursue purity?
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.260]   Because here's why I say this,
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.740]   you have a sexual desire now,
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.060]   you know that the Lord doesn't want you
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.460]   to express it right now in a way
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:06.260]   that would go against a committed relationship.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.840]   Where he says, hey, don't go outside
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.940]   of a committed relationship with your spouse.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.780]   And so you have this desire,
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.140]   and you're basically saying,
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.700]   hey, I don't care what God says,
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.020]   so that when I have this desire,
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.980]   I'm gonna act on this sexual desire at will.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:21.500]   Let me tell you something.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.180]   You're gonna have sexual desires
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.020]   for other men and women after you get married.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.140]   I wish I could say that wasn't true,
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:28.780]   but on this side of marriage,
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.940]   it's true.
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.500]   And so what is God trying to do?
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.580]   He wants you to pursue purity now,
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:37.240]   so that you can have patience and self-control later
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.300]   in your marriage, so that when you do have
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.060]   a sexual desire for someone else who's not your wife,
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.980]   that you have, what have you done?
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.020]   You've built patience and self-control,
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.840]   so that you can say no to those desires
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.180]   after you get married, and so that you can be
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.600]   a one-woman man and a one-man woman.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.060]   Amen?
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.060]   And so God is not trying to rip you off.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.320]   He's not trying to hold out on you.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.300]   Pursue purity, because it's worth it.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.540]   He's trying to give you,
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.540]   he wants to give you more trust in your relationship.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.060]   So many relationships, so many people I meet with,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.320]   they don't have trust.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.060]   They gotta track their spouse.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.420]   They don't even let their spouse hang out with the boys,
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.720]   or the girls don't even, can't even go out with the girls,
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.820]   because they're thinking, what are you doing?
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.800]   Because they're not giving them any reason to believe
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.340]   that anything's different.
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.860]   God is a God of purpose.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.840]   He loves you, he's created you.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:45.940]   I'm so thankful for my season of singleness,
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.020]   and the contentment and the purity that God grew,
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.180]   and I can stand up here tonight saying that,
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.980]   man, I've been faithful to my wife in the midst
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.500]   of temptation, in the midst of not being content
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.940]   in seasons of our marriage, because God did something
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.380]   in that season of singleness.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.100]   Tonight is the night where you begin to build that, right?
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.620]   Guys, I know, like I told you earlier, man,
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.100]   it was a long season of singleness for me.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.620]   And I did things that, man, I wasn't proud of.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.540]   My life wasn't content in Jesus alone,
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.920]   and I didn't pursue purity.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.640]   I did the things that I felt were right,
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.540]   like porn filled my lonely nights,
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.980]   sexual relationships after one another,
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:26.580]   left me empty, like partying, I mean, all those things,
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.860]   right, and I kept saying to myself, who would want this?
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:34.020]   Who would want this person full of baggage?
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.100]   Who would want me full of sin and self?
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.020]   And that's when the gospel came alive in my life,
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.260]   and I began to realize that Jesus wants this.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.300]   Jesus wants me.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.940]   That's the whole purpose of the gospel,
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:50.900]   that he became sin, he who knew no sin became sin,
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.260]   so that we might become the righteousness of Christ,
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.940]   so that we might be granted forgiveness
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.340]   and be in a right standing with him
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.060]   because of what he's done for us on the cross.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.900]   He wants you, so if you're thinking that tonight,
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.820]   if you're like, who would want this,
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.940]   who would want this baggage?
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.460]   There's hope.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.180]   The good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:14.180]   God sent Jesus to do the impossible.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:18.140]   It's the greatest love story that has ever been written.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.280]   That he died on a criminal's cross for you and me,
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.680]   that we wouldn't be punished for our sins,
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.300]   but that Jesus would be punished in our place.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:34.960]   In closing, I celebrated my first Valentine's Day
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:42.040]   with my wife, Kathy, back in 2013.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.060]   She lived in Addison.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.060]   We actually came to the porch.
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.820]   We actually sat right back there behind the sound booth.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.960]   Holler at my section back there.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:56.540]   I had this creative idea,
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:00.340]   this idea that was romantic,
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.200]   but had a spiritual twist to it.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.220]   We were doing the long distance thing.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.700]   I live two hours away.
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.780]   I'm like, hey, whatever for you, baby.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.720]   I'm all in.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.760]   She was like, let's just celebrate
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.820]   Valentine's Day on the weekend.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.740]   I'm like, no, no.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:18.180]   I'm not doing that.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.620]   I've fallen for that trick before.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:29.260]   I showed up at her apartment in Addison with one rose.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.700]   I had it behind my back.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:31.820]   She opened the door.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:34.980]   I said, here, baby.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.580]   Kathy, I'm giving you this rose
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.740]   'cause that's what they do on The Bachelor.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.460]   [audience laughs]
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:41.380]   I didn't say that.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.740]   I said, I'm giving you this rose, baby,
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:45.700]   not because I'm cheap,
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.600]   because you're worth a dozen roses.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.080]   But I'm giving you this rose as a symbol
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.980]   that every time you look at this rose,
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:59.480]   that God is calling you and I to be the one
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.840]   before we ever know if we're the one for each other.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.520]   I want you to have this rose,
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.000]   and I want you to look at it every day.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.840]   Because the most tragic thing that we could do
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.320]   as we continue to pursue each other in this relationship
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.040]   is we get consumed with marriage,
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.800]   or we get consumed with engagement,
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.300]   or we get consumed with these things
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:24.800]   that really don't matter at the end of the day,
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.840]   apart from becoming the one.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   I mean, they do, but if you're not becoming the one,
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.160]   it doesn't really matter.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:35.460]   And what I mean by becoming the one is becoming God's man.
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.720]   The things that we talked about tonight,
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.000]   becoming God's woman.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.760]   I've tried the other way, babe.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.020]   I don't wanna go back.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.120]   I don't wanna fall into sexual immorality.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.760]   I don't wanna do the things that the world does.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.800]   It's a trap, man.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.520]   It always overpromises, but it underdelivers.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.800]   So I'm giving you this one rose
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.600]   as a symbol of every time you look at this,
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.360]   I want you to remember that God is calling us
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   to be fixated on becoming the one that he wants us to be,
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.320]   to become his man, to become his woman.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.120]   Because here's what I know.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:19.480]   If we take our crosshairs off of becoming the one,
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.660]   then nothing else matters.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.160]   Marriage doesn't matter, engagement doesn't matter,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.680]   having kids doesn't matter,
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.080]   living life together doesn't matter.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.940]   And here's what I know.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.560]   If we don't get married,
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.440]   then we leave each other better than when we found
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.360]   each other, which, wow, that'd be a crazy phenomenon
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.240]   if we actually dated that way, right?
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.440]   But that's how God's men date.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.840]   That's how God's women date.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.880]   And we're gonna know quickly,
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.600]   if we focus on becoming the one,
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.480]   if we're called to get married or not,
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.760]   or we're gonna know quickly because the spirit of God
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.520]   is gonna tell us that, hey, this isn't right,
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.520]   we need to break up.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:59.240]   And so tonight, could I charge you with the same?
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:04.640]   Man, we've elevated marriage sometimes so much
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.560]   in the church that it's made you singles feel
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.800]   like outcasted, like you don't matter.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.060]   That's not the end goal.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:16.320]   The end goal is to love the Lord your God
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.820]   with all your heart, all your mind, all your soul.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.000]   The end goal is to seek first the kingdom of God
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.240]   and His righteousness, and He says,
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.440]   these things will be given to you.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   Now, I'm not promising you, He's not promising you a spouse,
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.880]   but He is promising you a life of fulfillment,
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.000]   a life of purpose, a life of satisfaction,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.160]   a life of contentment.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.480]   And so I share that story with you tonight, not to brag,
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.060]   not to say, look at me, 'cause God knows
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:48.060]   I've gotten it wrong before, but I share that story
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.120]   with you because it's a redemption story.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:54.600]   And that same redemption is offered to you.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:59.260]   I share that story because the most tragic thing
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.860]   that you could do tonight is walk out of these doors
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.920]   and focus on the wrong thing.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.060]   But I promise you that if you focus on becoming the one,
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:15.840]   that if you understand that God is calling you
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.360]   to be the one, if you focus on being God's man,
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:25.080]   that you'll never be mad.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.860]   You'll never be mad at God, you'll never be dissatisfied.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.520]   Sure, there might be some lonely moments,
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.000]   but God is gonna be there for you.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.480]   You'll never be alone.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.000]   He says He'll never leave you nor forsake you.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.180]   It's the highest call that you could ever have.
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:47.480]   And tonight I'm asking for you to take that call
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.760]   and make it real to your life.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.080]   The way you do this in singleness
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.360]   is to see your singleness as a gift.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.320]   Understand the reason why you're single,
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.200]   and for most of us in the room tonight,
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.520]   see your singleness as just for a season.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.240]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:10.120]   God in heaven, you gotta do the work that I can't do.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:20.300]   Lord, this work that I can't do is change hearts.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.040]   Every time I go at this, every time I get up here
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:28.320]   and speak or charge a group of people,
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.240]   there's something,
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:40.640]   there's something that supernaturally has to happen
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.280]   for you to change lives.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:49.320]   And so I'm begging you by the Spirit of God
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   to supernaturally give my friends a vision
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.580]   of a preferred future that affects
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.960]   their present reality tonight,
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.680]   that when they stand up and they worship,
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:08.880]   that something changes, something shifts in their heart,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:14.080]   and God, you would be made much of in their singleness,
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.120]   that you would get much glory,
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.080]   whether they're single for the rest of their life
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.880]   or they're single only for a season,
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.920]   that God, you would allow my friends
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.260]   to experience an unbelievable purpose
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:32.780]   and vision for their life that would trump anything else
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.580]   that this world could offer for your glory in Christ's name.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.420]   Amen.
