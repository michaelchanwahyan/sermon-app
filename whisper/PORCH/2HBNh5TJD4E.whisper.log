[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.820]   - All right, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.020]   We doing okay tonight?
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.020]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.100]   It's great to see you, man.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.260]   It's been an amazing start to the evening already.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.980]   Worship was incredible.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.500]   I'm so excited that we're not done singing.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.940]   We're gonna sing some more,
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.000]   but we always love that in the middle of our time,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.480]   God gives us even more reason to sing
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.000]   as we listen to his word.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.740]   We're really grateful that you would be here
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.620]   as we move towards that time,
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.620]   not just those of you in the room,
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500]   but there's so many of you tuning in online right now,
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.840]   and so we wanna give a special shout out
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.940]   to everyone that's streaming right now
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.700]   or maybe streaming in the future at some point,
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.580]   but particularly our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.580]   We love what God is doing around the nation.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.060]   Special shout out to Porch Live Boise, Midland, and Wheaton.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.300]   Love it.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.300]   Hey, we're really particular about who we invite
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.000]   to guest speak here at the Porch
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.800]   because we hold the word of God in really high regard.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.560]   We believe that it really is from the mouth of God himself
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.100]   and it is speaking to us today,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700]   and so we're really intentional about trying to,
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.700]   trying to protect this platform
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.840]   and put before you people that you may know,
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.380]   you may not know, but you should be listening to
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.740]   because it's not they who speak,
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.840]   it's Christ that speaks through them,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.300]   and tonight I'm grateful because we have a dear friend,
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.620]   the one and only Trip Lee here
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.340]   that has come to speak at the Porch.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.380]   If you don't know who Trip is,
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.660]   Trip is, he's a rapper, former pastor, he's an artist,
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.000]   but he is just a man that has very clearly walked with Jesus.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.900]   You can tell it when you spend time with him.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.740]   He looks like Jesus, he thinks like Jesus,
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.460]   he speaks like Jesus, and I think he preaches like Jesus.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.460]   So would y'all do a great job of welcoming my friend,
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.780]   Trip, to the stage right now?
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.780]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.220]   Thank you, man.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.460]   Thank you, man.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.020]   - How's everybody doing?
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.940]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.340]   You know, sometimes before I come up,
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.180]   people will ask me how I want to be introduced,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.100]   and I'm super low-key, you know,
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.860]   it's like whatever feels good,
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.740]   but I think from now on I will say
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.940]   please don't say I preach like Jesus because
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.860]   [audience laughing]
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.940]   not only is that a high bar, it's the highest bar possible,
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.640]   and so all I can do is disappoint you from this point.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.620]   [audience laughing]
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.820]   I'm really grateful to be here.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.360]   I love the Porch.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.220]   I love when I get to be with y'all and worship with y'all,
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.300]   and I'm gonna pray before we get into God's Word and pray.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.300]   That he will give us grace.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.860]   Father, we come before you in Jesus' name.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.740]   And we come before you in the name of Jesus, Father,
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.240]   because what you've told us in your Word
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.300]   is that there's no other name under heaven
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.020]   by which men can be saved.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.420]   Father, you've told us it's through Jesus
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.840]   that we have access to you.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   Father, you've told us that it's through Jesus
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.800]   that we have access to forgiveness of sins
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.180]   and eternal life and joy at your right hand forevermore.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.000]   We're so grateful for Jesus.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.340]   And it's in the name of Jesus we come before you now, Father,
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.620]   and we ask for your grace, Lord.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.660]   We want this to be time well spent in your Word.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.380]   We pray you would speak to us.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.060]   As our brother just said, we want this to be a time
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.100]   where you grab ahold of your Word
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.140]   and put it in our hearts by your Spirit,
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.680]   and we pray you would do that.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.100]   Father, we pray you give me grace
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.240]   to only say what you've already said.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.220]   Father, and that people would leave impressed
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.220]   with your Son, Jesus.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.580]   We ask in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.420]   Amen.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.540]   This first sentence that I'm gonna say
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.460]   is going to be the oldest sounding sentence
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.020]   that you'll probably ever hear me say.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.660]   In fact, after I say this sentence,
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.940]   some of y'all might wanna just start calling me unk,
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.300]   even though I'm not an unk age yet.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.900]   But I think we're giving computers
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.580]   too much power in our life.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.620]   I think we have given computers
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.120]   way too much power in our lives.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.900]   There were times where as new technology would come around,
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.120]   we would use different tools for different things.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.880]   Now, for some reason, we've decided
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.660]   that the worst possible thing that could happen
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.740]   is a human doing anything.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.620]   Sometimes I will see people
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.380]   with some new robot or AI they design,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.160]   I'm like, bro, do you want a job?
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.620]   Why would you design your replacement?
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.220]   But everything, you know, even so as a musician,
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.020]   even within music, I mean, there's amazing things
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.020]   that have happened with music technology
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.440]   that allows people to do things they could never do before,
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.380]   but sometimes it gets to a point
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.740]   where if we make everything on a computer
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.380]   where no one actually plays any instruments
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.700]   by themselves at all,
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.140]   or somebody who loves electronic instruments,
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.560]   there is something that's missed with a human touch.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.380]   Or when I talk to my friends who are dating,
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.700]   praise God, I'm at the game,
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.020]   but when I talk to my friends who are dating,
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.660]   and they talk about how difficult it is to meet people,
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.540]   and I ask them the ways they're meeting people,
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.020]   none of them have to do with looking
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.260]   at human beings in the eyeballs.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.060]   All of it has to do with what we're doing
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.220]   on these little computers in our pockets.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.580]   Don't call me ump just yet.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.440]   There's some limitations that technology has,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.860]   especially, you know, stuff like chat GPT,
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.540]   that sure, there's stuff that can help you.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.740]   If your mom is texting you to ask how your week is going,
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.380]   maybe chat GPT don't need to write that text back.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.660]   There are limits.
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.560]   Your mom knows what your sound's like.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.360]   There's some kinds of human nuance that cannot be captured,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.380]   so that even as technology is amazing,
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.180]   we understand, at least right now,
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.780]   there's some things that it's nice to have a human touch.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.780]   It has limitations.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.180]   It has some things it can't do as well.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.940]   Everything that is helpful,
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.040]   that we are aware of, has its limitations.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.100]   It has areas it's helpful,
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.100]   and areas where it's not as helpful.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.980]   And it's a good thing for us to understand
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.540]   that everything has its limitations.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.560]   Here's a problem.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.660]   When we begin to take that perspective,
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.620]   that everything has its limitations,
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.780]   and we begin to apply it to the Lord Jesus,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.900]   when we begin to think of Jesus
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.460]   as somebody who can be powerful and can be helpful,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.780]   but he has his limitations,
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.020]   or when we think Jesus can be helpful in these areas,
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.820]   with these kinds of problems,
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.260]   or with this size of problems,
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.900]   but not with these things,
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.420]   then we have deeply misunderstood who Jesus is.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.300]   We may think, well, I know God is able.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.060]   I just don't know that I see a way
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.100]   that he can fix this situation at the moment.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.700]   And so we're overcome with burden and anxiety.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.260]   I can't count the number of times
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.220]   where I was very stressed out about something.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.780]   I thought it was the end of the world,
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.780]   and then God fixed it, and I was like,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.300]   whew, I should've knew Lord, and then I move on.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.420]   Only for that thing to pop up again,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.780]   something very similar, it's like I have no idea
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.140]   my life is about to end,
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.940]   and sure enough, the Lord spooks in once again,
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.220]   over and over again.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.380]   Today, I want us to lean into that truth
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.180]   that Jesus is not limited.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.140]   And with that in mind, here's the main thing
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.500]   I want you to walk away with,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.740]   that the size of your problem
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.740]   does not change the source of your help.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.780]   The size of your problem does not change
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.940]   the source of your help.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.540]   And here's why that matters.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.800]   Here's why I want us to grab ahold of that.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.860]   Because I do not want us to think
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.880]   that Jesus is really helpful,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.260]   but there are some things where we need
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.140]   to call on somebody else,
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.980]   or there's some areas where we just need
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.640]   to give in to despair.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.100]   Brothers and sisters, there are some areas in your life
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.300]   that you have given over to despair,
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.220]   when in reality, the size of your problem
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.140]   does not change the source of your help.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.460]   So I want to look at a part of the Gospels.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.540]   If you have your Bible with you,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.780]   you probably don't, you're probably letting
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.820]   the computer have your Bible, your phone.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.620]   Either way, don't post this part of my sermon on the internet
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.020]   I don't need to seem un-kissed to anybody.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.700]   Now open your Bibles, John chapter six.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.920]   John chapter six.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.420]   And we are going to look at a part of the Gospel of John
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.260]   that I think illustrates this for us.
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.060]   And we're gonna see three reasons why the size
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.580]   of your problem doesn't change the source of your help.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.180]   Just go ahead and turn to John chapter six
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.900]   and we'll read it in a moment.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.580]   All right, here's the first reason.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.580]   Number one, is that he already has a plan.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.260]   All right?
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.300]   No matter what size your problem is,
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.960]   number one, Jesus already has a plan.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.280]   It is great when you have a big problem
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.560]   that you bring to somebody and you trust them
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.580]   to try to figure out how to fix it.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.060]   Recently there was an issue with my wife's car.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.780]   Now let me tell you, there are a lot of things
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.820]   that I'm great at.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.480]   Fixing cars is not one of them.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.940]   All right, there's some things I know how to fix.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.360]   Usually relationships, not cars.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.820]   So I can take it in and I can say,
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.760]   I don't know a lot about cars,
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.760]   but I know that ain't a sound that this is supposed to make.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.680]   And so you know what they did?
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.320]   They sent me back a link after they looked at it
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.280]   that identified the problems
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.780]   and their recommendations for fixing it.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.480]   Now of course, no matter what's wrong with your car,
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.980]   they're like, it's gonna cost you $49,000.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.320]   I'm like, I didn't think windshield wiper fluid
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.280]   was that expensive.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.080]   But it's nice when you bring a problem,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.520]   it takes some of the stress away.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.480]   You're no longer in it alone, right?
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.680]   When someone's willing to figure out what to do.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.520]   But there's something even greater than that.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.920]   The greatest response to bringing someone a complaint
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.600]   and a request is when they already know what to do
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.620]   before you even bring it.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.880]   They don't have to figure it out.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.160]   Y'all don't have to brainstorm together,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.360]   but they already know what to do.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.060]   You know, recently I got something from Uber Eats
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.500]   and Uber Eats is great when you're lazy, which is often.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.180]   And also, I've never gotten an order that's right,
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.160]   not one time.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.400]   And I keep going back like a sad little child.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.260]   But they get it wrong every time
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.500]   and then they don't know how to help you.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.620]   There's really nothing that they can do.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.460]   Here's the opposite.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.940]   There's this company that I buy music gear from.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.660]   It's called Sweetwater, it's a free ad.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.500]   Sweetwater.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.300]   [audience laughing]
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.860]   Sweetwater.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.380]   I bought, you know, when I buy something,
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.100]   I don't like to buy stuff I don't know I'm gonna keep
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.020]   'cause I am not good at sending stuff back.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.140]   If it made it to my house, it's just here now.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.600]   It's just part of my life.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.440]   You know what they did?
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.220]   I said, hey, this actually wasn't the right one.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.120]   They said, you know what?
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.740]   We've already emailed you return labels.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.360]   Just bring it back, we'll take it back for free.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.180]   I said, you have a customer for life.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.180]   Because before I even brought the problem to them,
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.160]   they already had a solution.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.820]   All I'm trying to say is this.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.700]   When you bring a problem to somebody
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.500]   and they've already done something about it,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.860]   that's even better than somebody
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.180]   who's willing to figure it out.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.280]   And that is exactly what happens here with Jesus.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.720]   We're gonna be familiar with this story
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.060]   in the Gospel of John, when Jesus feeds the 5,000.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.020]   So John chapter six, starting at verse one,
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.220]   this is what God's word says.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.180]   It says, after this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee,
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.340]   or Tiberias, a huge crowd was following him
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.560]   because they saw the signs that he was performing
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.180]   by healing the sick.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.340]   Jesus went up a mountain and sat down there
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.940]   with his disciples.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.340]   Now the Passover, a Jewish festival, was near.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.880]   So when Jesus looked up and noticed a huge crowd
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.620]   coming toward him, he asked Philip,
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.640]   where will we buy bread so that these people can eat?
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.620]   He asked this to test him, for he himself knew
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.220]   what he was going to do.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.940]   We'll stop right there.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.440]   For a little bit of context,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.900]   you know, it says, after this,
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.280]   Jesus had just been teaching after healing the sick.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.640]   Jesus had been doing stuff that nobody had ever seen.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.040]   They thought Jesus was just a regular dude from Galilee,
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.680]   and then he was at a wedding, and they was like,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.140]   Jesus, where's the wine?
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.580]   He was like, hey, fill 'em up with water,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.480]   and then all of a sudden, it was wine.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.640]   They're like, I thought that was Jesus.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.020]   How did he do that?
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.520]   Not only that, after that, there was somebody
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.000]   who was sick who he healed.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.120]   He just told 'em, take up your mat and walk,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.960]   and they were healed.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.880]   And then right before this, you know what Jesus did?
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.480]   Somebody came and talked about their son who was sick.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.840]   Jesus healed him remotely.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.120]   Jesus was just like, he good.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.680]   [audience laughs]
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.720]   And the dude was like, all right, I believe you.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.840]   And he went back, and they were like, your son is good.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.120]   He was like, when did he get good?
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.100]   It was like the exact time that Jesus remotely
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.780]   was like, he's good now.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.780]   Jesus is doing things that nobody can imagine.
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.160]   So understandably, when Jesus crosses over the sea
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.400]   with his disciples, people are following him.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.080]   When we see something incredible, something big,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.060]   a spectacle, even if it's not good,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.720]   we cannot take our eyes off it.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.120]   Some of y'all be the people that I'm mad at in traffic
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.400]   that just wanna look at a wreck for no reason.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.640]   Some of y'all hate follow people on social media.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.960]   You hate everything they say, but you can't stop looking.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.980]   We like a spectacle, whether good or bad.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.560]   And with Jesus, he had been doing things
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.880]   nobody had ever seen before, and so there's a gigantic,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.600]   mass of people that are following him around.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.760]   To be clear, Jesus did not invite all of this crowd
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.920]   to follow him around.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.720]   He did not announce a parade.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.420]   They just wanted to be close to whatever
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.000]   this miraculous greatness was.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.840]   And what we'll see in the Gospels is there's more
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.280]   than one way to follow Jesus.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.160]   There are good and bad ways to follow Jesus.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.520]   And we'll talk about that more, but I do wanna say
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.080]   that right now, even though Jesus is not a walking on Earth,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.920]   there are still good and bad ways to follow Jesus
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.500]   that do not acknowledge who he is.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.280]   There are ways of following Jesus only in name.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.640]   There are ways of treating Jesus like a vending machine.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.100]   There are ways of treating Jesus like a gumball dispenser,
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.200]   where you show up to church, you twist the knob,
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.680]   and you expect good blessings to fall out,
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.040]   and that is not the kind of follower that Jesus is after.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.220]   And we'll even see in his text that some of these people
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.600]   who are following after Jesus are not the kind of follower
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.440]   that Jesus is after, so Jesus responds by going up
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.240]   to a mountain with his disciples,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.140]   getting away from the crowd,
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.980]   to sit down and teach his disciples.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.920]   One of the things this shows us is that Jesus
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.440]   is not like these influences we see,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   where his end goal is gathering people around himself
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.660]   for personal gain.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.800]   Jesus' end goal is not crowds in and of themselves.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.060]   Jesus wants to lead those crowds to a particular place.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.960]   John also mentions that this is happening
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.640]   during the time of the Passover.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.260]   I mention that because it's very interesting
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.720]   that during this time of the Passover,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.840]   it's a time where they celebrate God sparing his people
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.400]   because of blood on the doorpost,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.180]   and that the Passover is really pointing forward
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.500]   to this Jesus who would save his people
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.420]   by covering them in his blood.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.880]   That this very special time in the calendar
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.800]   is even there to point to Jesus,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.040]   and what it means is that the Jewish people
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.840]   are also filled with a kind of patriotic pride right now,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.080]   and so when they see someone doing something amazing,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.360]   they're thinking about it in a patriotic way.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.080]   You'll see how that shows up.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.920]   Look at verse five, it says,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.560]   "So when Jesus looked up and noticed the huge crowd
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.280]   "coming toward him, he asked Philip,
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.320]   "where will we buy bread so that these people can eat?
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.820]   "He asked this to test him,
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.940]   "for he himself knew what he was going to do."
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.400]   Imagine just being with your friends
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.080]   and you look up and a gigantic mass of people are following.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.400]   That is a scary sight.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.120]   What we see from other accounts of this is,
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.880]   these people had been following Jesus
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.920]   not just for a few minutes but for hours.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.480]   They had walked miles after Jesus,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.880]   and Jesus sees them, and he cares about them.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.280]   He doesn't just say, "Isn't that crazy,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.200]   "these people are following me."
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.120]   No, no, no, he cares about them.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.680]   He's not just worried about getting his likes up,
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   he cares about the well-being of the people.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.740]   Jesus loves people.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:42.360]   And because Jesus loves people,
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.840]   that shapes how he interacts with them.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.560]   You know, sometimes when we think
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.000]   about what Jesus asks of us,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.560]   we think it's because Jesus wants us
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.800]   to just give, give, give to him.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.280]   It's because we're not thinking about the way
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.240]   that Jesus is always acting towards us in love.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.180]   This is just a random mob of people,
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.200]   Jesus is thinking of them in a loving way.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.560]   We sometimes think that our main relationship to Jesus
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.200]   is he throws us instructions and we better follow him
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.440]   'cause he is Jesus after all.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.320]   But in reality, everything that Jesus ever asks of us
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.640]   is in response to something that Jesus
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.220]   has already done for us.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.960]   There is no circumstance where any human being
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.200]   would make the first move with God.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.600]   Everything is a response to him.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.160]   Me and my wife was talking to one of our single friends
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.840]   recently, and she was complaining how she wishes
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.640]   that she had a dude to be talking to,
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.040]   but the dudes just wanna be pursued.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.720]   Then none of these dudes wanna make the first move,
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.560]   and that's another conversation for another sermon.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.120]   If it's you, I see you.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.120]   [audience laughing]
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.540]   But there are times in relationships where everybody's
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.800]   waiting for somebody else to make the first move
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.640]   and nobody wants to.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.100]   This can even happen in marriage,
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.640]   when something happens and it's like,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.360]   she better apologize first 'cause she was worse.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.240]   I ain't gonna apologize first.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.200]   Or you're in a conflict with somebody
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.860]   and you're waiting on them to text you back first.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.600]   And that can happen in every relationship.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.560]   I want you to know, God has never and will never
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.680]   wait for you to make the first move.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.440]   God has always made the first move.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.800]   And God knows your needs deeply,
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.680]   and he already has a plan to meet 'em.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.080]   So not only is Jesus aware of the needs of the crowd
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.120]   that they need to eat, but he already knows
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.400]   what he's gonna do.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.520]   So when he asks Philip, "Where will we buy bread?"
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.320]   I want you to imagine this, 'cause Jesus already knows
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.640]   he's about to do a miracle, and it's like he leans over
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.400]   to Philip like, "Hey, do you think Uber Eats
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.740]   "delivers this far out?"
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.760]   He already knows what he's doing.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.560]   This is a teachable moment.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.760]   This is a test.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.100]   And what is the purpose of tests?
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.420]   The purpose of any test is to show you how far along
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.520]   the student is, right?
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.440]   To prove worth or skill level.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.400]   To show what stage of development you're in.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.880]   Right, and so Jesus is trying to see if Philip
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.000]   really understands his power.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.040]   To see if Philip responds like he's talking
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.600]   to a regular human who's asking him to just do
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.960]   a bit of problem solving.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.000]   And so Jesus is asking Philip, "Hey, what do you think
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.580]   "we can buy these people bread?"
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.600]   Not because Jesus wants to know where Philip is at,
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.320]   but because Jesus wants to show Philip where Philip is at.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.520]   Usually when Jesus asks a question to his disciples,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.080]   he's trying to show them where they are.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.460]   Like when he says, "So who do men say that I am?"
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.600]   He wants to show them that they don't fully understand
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.520]   who he is yet.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.320]   That's what tests are for.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.240]   I remember one time when my first son was really young,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.360]   I was like, when I was a little kid,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.880]   my dad used to cut my hair.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.040]   I'm gonna cut his hair.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.160]   And do you know what that exercise showed me?
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.060]   That I should not be cutting his hair.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.320]   He looked horrific.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.680]   He looked so bad that I thought about just keeping it
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.360]   at home for several months so that nobody would ever
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.200]   know what I did.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.360]   'Cause I was gonna have to take him to a barber
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.740]   and be like, take the hat off like, my bad.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.000]   It showed me where I was at though.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.320]   God still tests his people from time to time.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.640]   There may be things that happen around us
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.680]   that show us where we are, right?
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.360]   And the goal is for us to grow.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.740]   There may be something happening in your life right now
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.960]   where the problem in front of you seems insurmountable.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.840]   You cannot imagine how you're gonna come out
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.880]   the other side of it.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.800]   And God is using that to show you where you are.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.120]   And when we fail a test, it's not so God can shame us
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   or guilt us, it's not so you feel bad.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.680]   It's God giving us an opportunity to grow.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.160]   It is a blessing that God is so gracious
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.060]   that instead of just letting us stay at a place
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.540]   where we need to grow, God does things to show us
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.520]   where we are so that we see we need to grow.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.000]   This is not God shaming us, this is God loving us
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.320]   so much that he's calling us forward.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   Some of us, when we look at the things happening
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.280]   in our lives, we consider them a bunch
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.740]   of random circumstances.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.760]   Sometimes Jesus is doing something on purpose
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.700]   to show you exactly where you are.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.560]   And it's gracious of him to do it.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.900]   It's out of his kindness.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.800]   Verse six, it says, "He asked us to test him,
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.360]   "for he himself knew what he was going to do."
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.680]   Before the disciples even knew what the problem was,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.400]   Jesus already knew what he was gonna do about the problem.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.380]   There are so many times when we are caught off guard
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.200]   by situations, I want you to know,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.220]   like Jesus in this text, God is never caught off guard.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.200]   God has never been sucker punched by a circumstance.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.040]   Right, 'cause this is how it works with people.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.720]   By the time you get, by the time you get your problem
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   to somebody else's attention, they have to begin
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.240]   to brainstorm what to do.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.160]   God already knows.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.960]   When we bring things to God, he already knows.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.360]   He already knows what to do about it.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.280]   Isn't it a joy to know that you will never bring God
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.200]   a problem that he didn't already know about?
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.920]   I remember somebody saying, "Well, why do we pray?"
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.720]   It's not so that we can bring God up to speed.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.960]   You will never be the first one to break news to God.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.440]   He already knows.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.120]   You know, sometimes when you're in a bad place
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.500]   and people wanna ask how they can help,
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.840]   but you don't even wanna go into it.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.280]   You're not sure they'll understand.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.660]   You never have to feel that way for God.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.880]   He already knows.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.720]   And he knows before you do.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.440]   And it's because he loves you.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.920]   You know that closeness you feel with a friend
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.320]   when you don't even have to always explain it all the way
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.920]   and they already understand you?
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.000]   I want you to do that times a million
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.520]   and that's how God understands you.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.640]   He already knows your problem.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.760]   And the disciples were beginning to learn
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.960]   the power that the son of God had.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.280]   They were starting to follow.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.800]   All right, so he already has a plan.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.960]   That's number one.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.560]   Right, the size of your problem doesn't change
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.400]   the source of your help.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   Here's the second reason.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.200]   It's because he already has enough.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.840]   He already has enough.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.240]   Sometimes, some of us may dream about what we would do
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.220]   if suddenly we were just incredibly rich.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.440]   Right, people be like, if I was a billionaire,
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.280]   you know what I would do?
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.320]   Well, first, I would buy this and this and this.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.000]   And then, you know that one teacher who said
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.240]   she believed in me, buy a Maserati.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.760]   [audience laughing]
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.080]   Right, we go through all this stuff.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.240]   These things we'd like to do, these things we'd like to buy,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.440]   these people we'd like to help.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.920]   And we like to do this imaginary game
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.480]   because for most of us, we live in a reality
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.920]   where all of our desires can't be fulfilled.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.320]   There are projects, there are dreams, there are desires
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.080]   that we do not have the resources to go after
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.000]   at the moment, right?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.580]   I want you to know, this is an experience
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.760]   that is completely foreign to God.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.560]   In order for God to wish he could do something,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   if he had the resources, he would have to stop being God.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   Scripture says that the earth is the Lord's
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.240]   and all that's in it, everything belongs to God.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.640]   He always has enough, always.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.460]   And I bring this up because of how Philip replies
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.240]   when Jesus asks him about the bread.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.000]   This is what Philip says when he says,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.400]   where can we get bread, verse seven.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.440]   Philip answered him, 200 denarii worth of bread
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.380]   wouldn't be enough for each of them to have a little.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.600]   One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.000]   said to him, there's a boy here who has five barley loaves
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.240]   and two fish, but what are they for so many?
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.520]   And this might be a good time to make clear
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.240]   how big this crowd was.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.640]   When we think of Jesus feeding the 5,000,
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.200]   we usually imagine that there were 5,000 people there total.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.500]   When what the text says in verse 10 is that
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.020]   the men numbered about 5,000, right?
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.180]   At the time, crowds were counted by the heads
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.760]   of the household, but the crowd certainly
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.360]   would have included women and children.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.640]   I mean, we know children were there 'cause he just says,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.120]   there's a boy here, there are women and children.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.760]   So that means this crowd was probably 20,000 or more.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.200]   State Farm Arena, where the Atlanta Hawks play in Atlanta,
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.180]   holds 16,000 people, right?
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.040]   This means this is like a large arena concert-sized
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.000]   group of people walking after Jesus,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.800]   which gives a little context for the way that Philip
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.700]   responds when he's like, hey, how can we buy them bread?
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.160]   Philip is looking at an arena of people like,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.980]   I don't know if I can do that.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.900]   He says 200 denarii wouldn't be enough.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.680]   That's about half a year's wage, right?
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   Philip is taking it at face value,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.640]   the vastness of the crowd compared to how much
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.900]   it would cost, that's like half a year's wage.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.180]   So he's saying, even if I took every dollar
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.300]   that I made for six and a half months,
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.940]   I still couldn't buy enough bread for everybody
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.620]   to get a few nibbles.
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.580]   Have you ever been to something where there wasn't
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.180]   enough food for everybody, like a party or something?
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.020]   And you're like, I know they said just get two wings
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.580]   a piece, but what are we doing?
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:05.020]   Super Bowl party, where you're like,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.720]   I knew I shouldn't have trusted him to provide food.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.600]   When has he ever shown himself to be responsible?
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.020]   Sometimes there's not enough for everybody.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.900]   Philip responds as if the only way that everybody
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.740]   could be fed is if there's enough in front of us.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.300]   And I'm sure after this happens,
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.820]   Philip's understanding of Jesus is changed.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.060]   But you may say, but true, Philip responded
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   very reasonably.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.340]   What was he supposed to say when Jesus said,
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.420]   where are we gonna get bread?
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.180]   Was he supposed to just ignore what he sees
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.580]   in this sea of people?
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.820]   And here's what I'll say.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.060]   God does not call his disciples to ignore
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.660]   the evidence of our eyes.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.500]   He doesn't call us to pretend that there's not
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.740]   a big problem that needs to be solved.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.380]   God calls us to see with more than just eyes.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.660]   He doesn't call us not to see with our eyes,
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.300]   but with more to consider other factors
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.180]   such as who he is.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.180]   So with whatever big thing is going on in your life,
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.580]   there is more to the story.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.060]   Maybe your career plans are falling apart.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.020]   I want you to know if Jesus is in the picture,
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.820]   there is more to the story.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.180]   Maybe your mental health is falling apart.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.520]   If Jesus is in the picture, there is more to the story.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.900]   The problem is not that Philip could see with his eyes.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.360]   The problem is Philip only saw with his eyes.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.060]   We assume that God is bound by the natural world,
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.460]   by all the things we're bound by.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.140]   God works in the supernatural.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.500]   He is unlimited.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.940]   Right, and then Andrew responds as well.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.380]   Verse nine, there's a boy here who has five barley loaves
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.460]   and two fish, but what are they for so many?
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.300]   I mean, he's really like, I mean, I seen a kid
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.100]   with a sleeve of Ritz crackers,
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.700]   but what we gonna do with that?
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.740]   [audience laughs]
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.500]   That's basically what he said.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.980]   'Cause that bread and the fish wouldn't have been
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.380]   enough to feed a family.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.660]   Not an arena, and that's the problem.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.540]   I was at a wedding recently, and there was only
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.980]   130 people there, but at the reception,
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.160]   it was taking too long for the food to be served,
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.980]   and I felt a mutiny boiling around me,
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.980]   where people were hungry.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.100]   This is an impossible number of people to feed,
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.380]   but here's the thing, Jesus is not a millionaire
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.540]   who might run out of money.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.180]   He's God with an indispensable amount of resources.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.360]   If Jesus made everything, how could we think
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.060]   he couldn't gather enough food for people?
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.540]   Jesus has been feeding every living creature
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.940]   for all of human history.
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.100]   Of course he can feed a big crowd.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:25.420]   When we limit what God can do with a big problem,
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.020]   we begin to seek power in other places.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.660]   There's some believers who are caught up
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.700]   in political power at times, because they think
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.280]   that God's power, that God's ways are not enough
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.740]   to do things, and so they begin to seek power
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.200]   in other places, political power, maybe,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.660]   authority in other ways.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.860]   They think, well, let me do what I think God can.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.140]   This is what it says in verse 10.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.580]   Jesus said, "Have the people sit down."
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.900]   There's plenty of grass in that place,
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.540]   so they sat down, the men numbered about 5,000.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.860]   Then Jesus took the loaves, after giving thanks,
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.380]   he distributed them to those who were seated,
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.620]   so also with the fish, as much as they wanted.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.460]   When they were full, he told his disciples,
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.760]   "Collect the leftovers so that nothing is wasted."
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.440]   So they collected them and filled 12 baskets
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.660]   with the pieces from the five barley loaves
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.800]   that were left over by those who had eaten.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.780]   He tells them to sit down in the grass,
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.660]   a bunch of 5,000 grown men trying to sit Indian style
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.220]   for the first time in 10 years.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.300]   With kids running around, you know kids don't sit down
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.480]   when you tell them to, it takes several times.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.060]   Jesus takes the loaves, thanks God for the food,
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.140]   he begins passing them out.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.860]   I don't really know how the logistics works.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.460]   I don't know if it's like when magicians keep
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.500]   just pulling more ribbon out of their mouth, I don't know.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.140]   But somehow, as these very few fish and loaves
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.780]   is passed out, everybody gets them.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.780]   They never run out, people go back for seconds,
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.380]   as much as they wanted, and the people were full.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.500]   When you gotta feed a lot of people,
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.260]   everybody's usually not full, and there were leftovers.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.980]   So it's not only that Jesus was able to provide enough,
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.460]   Jesus was able to provide more than enough
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.500]   to where they had even more than they started with.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.040]   This is the power of Jesus, he already has enough.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.700]   So with whatever big problem you have and you wonder,
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.700]   like no, no, Jesus has done ABC before,
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.300]   I'm not sure he can do this.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.660]   Everything is in his hands.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.380]   Everything belongs to God.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.420]   Everything belongs to God.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.580]   You think, I know, but this person,
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.700]   I can't change their mind, that person belongs to God.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.380]   No, no, no, but I don't have no money in my bank,
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.220]   that money belongs to God.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.180]   No, but you don't understand my discouragement,
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.880]   your heart, your soul, your mind belongs to God.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.180]   Jesus already has enough.
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.540]   Ephesians 3:20, now to him who was able to do
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.060]   above and beyond all that we ask or think
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.060]   according to the power that works in us,
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.700]   to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.900]   to all generations forever and ever.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:01.380]   Nothing limits Jesus, not even the needs we present to him,
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.060]   he can do far more.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:07.160]   So when you pray to God, I want you to keep this in mind.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.460]   When you think about your needs,
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.340]   I want you to keep this in mind.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.060]   Because maybe this being about Jesus feeding people,
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.940]   maybe you're in a season where, you know,
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.260]   you're not struggling with having too little food
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.920]   or clothing or necessities.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.100]   That's not what you don't have a lot of,
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.660]   but maybe, what about joy?
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.740]   What about strength?
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.660]   What about health?
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.340]   What about wisdom?
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.340]   What about opportunities?
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.420]   What about faith?
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.140]   I want you to know that Jesus
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.520]   has more than enough to pass out.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.940]   You ever seen people who are the kids of like,
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.220]   super duper billionaires?
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.620]   Sometimes what'll happen is they'll go after their dreams
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.440]   and that would just be people in their comments
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.140]   all the time, it's like, why you doing that, you rich?
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.780]   Not allowing them to try anything,
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.800]   'cause they just know, no, no, no,
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.260]   you have a family member that has billions of dollars,
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.620]   you don't actually need to do all of this.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.140]   They have unlimited money.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.060]   Billionaires sometimes just be giving lots of money
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.980]   to different causes 'cause it doesn't hurt them.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.700]   I want you to know, if there's a God who everything
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.180]   in all of the universe, everything that exists,
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.020]   belong to him, he can give as much as he wants
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.940]   and it doesn't hurt him.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.380]   He's rich in grace, he's rich in mercy,
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.500]   he's rich in all resources.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.340]   So the question is not, does he have enough?
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.860]   The question is, what's best for us?
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.380]   He already has a plan, he already has enough.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.380]   Y'all still with me?
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.180]   The size of your problem doesn't change
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.420]   the source of your help.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.120]   Last reason is this, he already has a kingdom.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.460]   He already has a kingdom.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.740]   Sometimes when crowds are quiet,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.780]   I just look and see if I see pins moving.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.940]   I see some pins moving.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.300]   He already has a kingdom.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.140]   Verse 14.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.780]   Y'all was even quiet after I said that, verse 14.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.460]   [audience laughing]
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.580]   When the people saw the sign he had done,
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.740]   they said, this truly is the prophet
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.740]   who was to come into the world.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.420]   Therefore, when Jesus realized that they were about to come
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.420]   and take him by force to make him king,
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:21.100]   he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.340]   Remember earlier I said there are good and bad ways
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.100]   to follow Jesus and to respond to Jesus.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.680]   I think the people responded interestingly.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.220]   They were impressed by the sign that they had seen.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:37.540]   And it was clear to them, this is not just a regular guy.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.700]   Right?
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.620]   This is not just a spectacle, this is something incredible
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.180]   that must have come from God.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.060]   When they say truly this is the prophet,
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.180]   they were probably thinking of Deuteronomy 18.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.140]   Where it says the Lord your God will raise up for you
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.680]   a prophet like me from among your own brothers.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.500]   You must listen to him.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.820]   This is what you requested from the Lord your God
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.700]   at Horeb on the day of the assembly
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.160]   when you said let us not continue to hear the voice
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.800]   of the Lord our God or see this great fire any longer
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.020]   so that we will not die.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.940]   Then the Lord said to me, they've spoken well,
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.060]   I will raise up for them a prophet like you
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.340]   from among their brothers.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.860]   I'll put my words in his mouth and he will tell them
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.540]   everything I command.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.020]   That's probably what they had in mind when they said
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.960]   this is the prophet from God.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.420]   But what's interesting is it seemed like they started
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.700]   to merge the category of prophet with king.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.500]   I told you it's Passover, they're feeling patriotic.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.900]   They're feeling excited about their nation.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.460]   And so they're expecting Jesus to be an earthly king
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.900]   and that's interesting 'cause that doesn't at all
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.460]   match up with what we see in Deuteronomy.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.480]   They weren't demanding to hear more about the words of God,
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.600]   they were demanding the kind of things that you might want
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.580]   from an excellent politician.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.420]   This shows where Israel like, you could be waiting
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.180]   for something, longing for something and still not even
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.380]   understand what you're waiting for when it's right
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.500]   in front of your face.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.540]   They wanted to make Jesus king by force,
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.700]   which would only be possible.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.060]   Now you think, how could they make Jesus king by force?
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.460]   Remember, this is a mob of 20,000 people.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.740]   They're saying we're about to just snatch Jesus up
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.300]   and make him king and Jesus of course responds
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.300]   by withdrawing to the mountain because Jesus was not
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.820]   interested in earthly political power as his reign.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.540]   He did not come for temporary national leadership,
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.100]   he came to redeem and to renew at a deeper level.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.360]   Right, we are, you know, a little bit after there was
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.740]   a politician, election season isn't that far back,
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.060]   when politicians thirstily beg for us to love them
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.440]   and care for them so that they can get elected.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.940]   But I want you to know what Jesus is doing
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.740]   is the opposite of political rallies.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.420]   Jesus gathers us to serve us.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.220]   Not that there are no politicians who have good motives
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.580]   but there is not an ounce of self-serving in the way
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.980]   that Jesus leads, there's no pandering,
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.340]   there's no compromising the truth for the sake of popularity
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.940]   there's no worrying about, if I should say true things
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.660]   because of how it will affect.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:08.620]   There's no ruthless self-serving, this is Jesus.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.220]   Not saying just what people want to hear
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.620]   but gathering us in order to serve us.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.980]   What's really clear is they misunderstood the kind of reign
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.380]   that Jesus came to bring.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.980]   They said let us give you this earthly kingdom.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.900]   John 6, 26, Jesus said, truly I tell you,
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.500]   you're looking for me, not because you saw the signs
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.520]   but because you ate the loaves and were filled.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.420]   Don't work for the food that perishes
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.580]   but for the food that lasts for eternal life
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.360]   which the Son of Man will give you
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.720]   because God the Father has set his seal of approval on.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.000]   John 6, 35, Jesus says, I'm the bread of life.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.020]   No one who comes to me will ever be hungry,
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.900]   no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.660]   But as I told you, you've seen me
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.100]   and yet you do not believe.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.580]   Y'all, they wanted Jesus to be king
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.280]   instead of king of kings.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.380]   They didn't want Jesus to rule as the eternal king
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.120]   of the universe, they wanted him to be
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.360]   a lowercase king of Israel.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.980]   This is like Jesus saying I've come to save your souls,
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.940]   to bring new heaven and the new earth,
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.980]   to do away with all sin and pain.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:13.900]   And we're like, no, no, no, Jesus,
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.300]   we want you to be president.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:21.020]   We want you to try to work out a deal with Congress.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.620]   They're disappointed that Jesus wouldn't be
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.540]   a lowercase king because they do not understand
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.680]   the glory of being under the reign of the king of kings.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.240]   When we are disappointed with Jesus,
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.220]   it's because our sights are set too low.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.820]   When we are disappointed that Jesus hasn't given us
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.720]   all these little earthly things we want,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.740]   it's because we're missing the fact that Jesus
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.980]   is after more than just those earthly things,
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.420]   not less, more.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.720]   When Jesus says no to something we ask him for,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.660]   it's not because he doesn't want to give us great things,
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.900]   it's because he's given us something better instead.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.540]   And that he knows what's best for us.
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.340]   So Jesus is saying, look,
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.500]   I'm not here just to fill your stomachs.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.440]   They wanted Jesus to be a bakery, right?
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.900]   Jesus says, I'm the bread of life.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.700]   This isn't the bread that comes down from heaven
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.900]   so that anyone may eat it and not die.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.500]   He says, I'm the living bread that came down from heaven.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.180]   If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.920]   The bread that I will give for the life of the world.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.380]   Jesus is saying, your ancestors had manna from heaven
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.340]   and they died.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.260]   He says, I have something even better for you.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.380]   The bread of life that you will have eternal life.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.600]   Jesus did not come to make us sandwiches.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.140]   Jesus came to make us whole.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.300]   Imagine being disappointed that instead of just feeding us
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.140]   for a moment, Jesus says, I will feed your soul
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.260]   for an eternity.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.620]   Here's one of my favorite things about Jesus
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.820]   and the gospels is that Jesus doesn't just point us
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.920]   to good things.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.840]   Jesus says, I am the good thing.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.540]   Jesus doesn't just say, I can point you
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.380]   to the bread of life.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.940]   Jesus says, I am the bread of life.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.620]   Eat of me, you'll never hunger again.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.780]   Jesus doesn't say, I can point you to living water.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.820]   Jesus says, I am the living water.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.140]   Drink of me, you'll never thirst again.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.140]   Jesus doesn't say, I can point you to the way.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.620]   Jesus says, I am the way.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.260]   Jesus doesn't say, I can tell you the truth.
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.900]   He says, I am the truth.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.820]   Jesus doesn't just say, I can point you to life.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.740]   He says, I am the life.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.620]   And the entire point of everything that Jesus does
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.900]   is not just to feed our bellies, but to feed our souls.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:35.020]   If the way you follow and look to Jesus
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.420]   is one where you're disappointed when you don't get
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.380]   every little thing you want,
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.900]   it's because you're overlooking the way that Jesus
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.980]   has already met your greatest need.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.460]   There's some times we're disappointed
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.900]   because of the temporary ways that Jesus
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.980]   hasn't done exactly what we've asked of him.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.500]   And Jesus is saying, I'm actually interested
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.460]   in more than that.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.940]   And it's out of love and kindness.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.220]   So that someone may say, okay, I know that there was
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.700]   this man who was a great teacher who walked the earth
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.740]   and we have great things to learn from him
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.980]   and he can solve my problems with having bad perspectives.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.500]   I want you to know, you're thinking
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.940]   too small of Jesus.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.060]   And there's a much bigger problem that we have.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.940]   Sin, death.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:28.460]   Right, well people will say nothing is certain
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.380]   except death and taxes.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.900]   You will die.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.300]   Your life will end.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.540]   There's no amount of medicine or food
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.180]   that can keep your life from ending
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.660]   except there's a savior who says, I've conquered death.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.820]   And you know, sometimes when people make such big claims
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.140]   like they can hold death back,
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.380]   it's like, well what are you talking about?
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.020]   How can you show me?
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.300]   Look, one of the most beautiful things about Jesus
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.460]   is he never said anything that he didn't back up
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.240]   in a way even greater than we would have imagined.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.660]   Jesus could have just said, well no,
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.420]   look at the way I raised Lazarus.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.740]   Look at the way I raised Talitha.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.100]   I'm just talking to people, they're getting out of the grave.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.140]   Jesus said, I'm gonna go in the grave myself
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.740]   to pay for your sins.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.180]   Scripture says that the wages of sin is death.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.400]   Jesus said, I already paid those wages.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:28.140]   [audience applauding]
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:37.100]   And the beautiful thing about these unimaginable miracles
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.500]   is if you're tempted for a moment to doubt,
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.700]   this man Jesus who says that he can save my soul,
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.300]   what proof do I have?
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.980]   Because that sounds impossible.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.580]   That sounds too big.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.020]   That he can wipe away my sins,
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.540]   give me a perfect record that I can live forever
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.560]   with a glorified body, eternal joy forever.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:06.140]   Jesus does these incredible miracles throughout the Gospels
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.180]   to remind us there's much more than meets the eye.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.020]   As soon as you think there's a problem too big,
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.580]   I've solved it over and over and over again.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.460]   So for those problems in your soul,
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.700]   there is a Savior who says, I want you to come to me,
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.980]   not just to feed you for a moment, but for eternity.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:31.620]   And he calls you, he welcomes you, he loves you,
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.460]   he forgives you by faith.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.020]   Jesus says, trust me and I will feed your soul forever.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.540]   The size of your problem doesn't change
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.820]   the source of your help because there is a Savior
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.380]   who's not limited in his name, it's Jesus.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.520]   Amen, amen, let me pray.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:00.060]   Father, we come before you in the name of Jesus.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.620]   Aware of the fact that there's not enough time
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.740]   or enough words or enough illustrations or enough stories
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.780]   that could ever get close to pointing
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.460]   to your majesty and power.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.460]   God, the sheer scale of your power that you showed
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:29.900]   means that everything we do is a weak attempt.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.660]   But Father, what we know is that your word is true
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.460]   and that your spirit uses your word.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.260]   Father, we pray you would impress on our hearts and souls
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.540]   the glory of Jesus, not just as a great teacher
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.460]   and a miracle worker, but as a Savior.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.820]   Thank you for Jesus.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.500]   Father, I pray our souls will feast on Jesus.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.600]   God, there was celebration at the passover.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.800]   There was a feast to celebrate what you had done.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.540]   God, thank you for a Savior who says,
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.220]   feast on me for an eternity.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.460]   God, give us grace to be satisfied in him.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.220]   God, I pray for my brothers and sisters in this room
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:09.260]   who see things in their life that seem bigger than Jesus.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.140]   I pray you would show them that giants are tiny
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.340]   when they stand before the Savior, Jesus.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.620]   Father, and for my friends in this room
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.780]   who do not know Jesus, God, I pray you would help them
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.980]   to see how powerful, how gracious, how loving,
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.280]   how kind the Savior is.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:31.380]   They would trust in his death and resurrection.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.620]   Father, and that they would have friends
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.420]   to walk alongside them in it.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.660]   We ask this in the name of your son, Jesus.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:37.500]   Amen.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.260]   (water bubbling)
