[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - 108 verses, 54 of them are imperatives.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.140]   An imperative is a command.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:20.980]   That Jesus was not just his half-brother,
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.060]   he was his Lord.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.680]   - What's up, guys?
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.520]   Hey, welcome, friends in the room
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.940]   and in Scottsdale, Arizona, Indianapolis, Des Moines, Iowa,
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960]   Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Phoenix, Arizona, Fayetteville,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.060]   Arkansas, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas,
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.900]   wherever you are joining in from and anybody online,
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.240]   we are continuing this series in the book of James,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.280]   where we are looking at for the next handful of weeks
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.200]   and really the previous handful of weeks,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.640]   listening to the half-brother of Jesus
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.880]   on some of the 14 topics that he covered.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.120]   And we're gonna launch into another one of them tonight.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.560]   I've got a two-year-old daughter whose name is Monroe.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.800]   And one thing that we started doing
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.000]   during shelter-in-place quarantine
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.860]   was we had this creek by our house
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.840]   that we would go down to
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.560]   and we would just throw rocks in the creek.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.000]   I think we even have a picture either of her or even,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.840]   oh, there she is.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.960]   Oh, man, she's just the best.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.960]   Oh, she can't say her R's or her W's.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.280]   So when she says, "We're going to the creek,"
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.560]   it's, "We're going to the queek, we're going to the queek."
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.760]   And her brother corrects her.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.800]   And I'm like, "Man, I will spank you
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.600]   if you correct her again."
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.480]   I hope she's 16 saying, "I'm going to the queek."
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.040]   And anyway, so we'll go down there.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.640]   And what we'll do, it's not exactly,
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.360]   it's actually, I think, like a sewage run,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.480]   but it looks like a creek.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.940]   And we'll go and we will throw rocks
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.320]   into this little like pond, creek thing that is there.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.160]   And they just love it.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.480]   They could do it all day.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480]   And anytime now that we see or pass a rock anywhere,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.440]   including here at Watermark,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.640]   she wants to collect them and put them in her pockets
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.440]   to bring them to go throw at the queek.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.740]   And so we'll walk around.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.800]   I mean, true story, anywhere.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.920]   We're at her little brother's baseball game.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.120]   She goes over, she like finds a rock in the corner.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.800]   She's like, "I'm putting it in my pocket for the queek."
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.680]   And then she'll run out of space in her pocket.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   So I'll find in her laundry, all kinds of rocks.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.640]   She puts them in our pockets.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.480]   We just have rocks.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.160]   True story, I got these from the laundry room
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.040]   this morning, today, because she will just load up.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.800]   Because anytime she sees a rock, it doesn't matter the size,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.520]   doesn't matter how colorful it is,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.000]   doesn't matter how big or small,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   it is a potential source of something
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.820]   to throw in the creek.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.800]   They're all incredibly valuable to her.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.120]   So wherever she finds them,
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.940]   she is gonna take them to use them.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.880]   What does that have to do
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.720]   with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.360]   Well, tonight we're gonna talk about the subject
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.460]   of favoritism.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.440]   And in that scenario, my daughter looks at every single rock
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.760]   that exists on planet earth and is like,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.400]   "This all has value because it's something that I can take
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.200]   and go with my brother to throw in the creek."
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.800]   And when the scriptures talk about how you and I
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.840]   are to look at one another,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.080]   it is to the command that you are to see
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.040]   every person you've ever met, Christian, non-Christian,
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   old, black, white, brown, age, gender,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.480]   as someone who is of incredible value.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.640]   Favoritism, by definition, is treating someone differently,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.600]   thinking about someone differently,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   saying or speaking to someone differently
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.440]   based on how you perceive them, how you think about them.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.120]   And the scripture says,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.360]   "This can be a source of tremendous division
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.280]   and is something that God hates
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.200]   and is a sin that's not to take place inside of the church."
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.840]   Now, just to get us going, in case you're like,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840]   "Man, do I really do that?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.220]   'Cause I think most people walk in the room like,
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.800]   "Oh, great, talking about favoritism,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.480]   partiality, not my struggle."
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.320]   I think in general, all of us, all the time,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.840]   are processing information
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.040]   and we are based on our preferences
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.760]   determining how we're gonna interact with that thing.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.800]   It doesn't even have to do with people.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   Let me use an example.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.080]   Any dog people in this room?
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.900]   Dog moms?
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.740]   There you go.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.200]   Any cat people?
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.280]   Like, you are dismissed.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   And I'm totally kidding.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.080]   I'm totally kidding.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.760]   All right, think about, if you are a dog person,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.400]   you walk into the dog room, no offense,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.500]   and you walk in, somebody's got a dog,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.180]   and they're there, and you walk in
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.020]   and you haven't met them before,
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.120]   but the dog's there, they look friendly,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.160]   you go up, you're just gonna pet 'em,
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.560]   and especially if you're a dog person,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.680]   like, "Oh, this is great."
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.280]   You walk into somebody's house and they have a cat,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.480]   if the cat approaches you, it's like,
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.160]   "What is going on right now?"
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.840]   And if it comes up and begins to paw
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.320]   or like jump at you like a dog would,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.400]   you're like, "Okay, this is not okay."
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.320]   Like, they're just supposed to kind of scurry by themselves
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.080]   and run off, and I don't know what cats do.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.480]   But in that moment, based on your preferences,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.040]   it's influencing and impacting how you behave.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.020]   Here's another silly one.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.140]   Someone's type of phone will impact
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.740]   how you think about that person.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.000]   There are people out there called Android users,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.100]   and they make every text group green.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.100]   And you just got their digits, or you connected,
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.740]   and you got their number, and you go to text them,
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.580]   you're like, "Hey, what's going on,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.940]   "or what do you got going on this weekend?"
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.340]   And then all of a sudden, a color pops up, boom,
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.900]   and it's green, and you're like, "Oh, man."
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.200]   Maybe, maybe it's just like they're out of Wi-Fi
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.100]   right now or something, and the next one will go through,
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.580]   and it doesn't go through, it's still green,
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.480]   and we can't name our text messages groups because of you.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.260]   And you go begin to process through like,
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.860]   "Oh, man, I didn't see you for an Android person.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.240]   "Interesting, that is interesting."
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.880]   And not just that, it impacts how we interact
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.760]   with each other, especially people of the opposite sex.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.840]   If there's a girl that you find attractive,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.280]   or a guy that you find attractive, it's going to impact,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.400]   it's just human nature, how you interact with that person.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.220]   You're gonna be more curious, asking questions,
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.700]   you're kinda bumping up, and like,
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.000]   "Oh, hey, what's going on over there?"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.900]   And you're just dialoguing in the conversation,
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.020]   versus oftentimes, if you're not,
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.560]   you're just kinda moving about your way,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.280]   and he's not that into you, and you are impacted
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.520]   based on how you perceive or how you think about someone,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.860]   how your preferences impact.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.080]   And what becomes tragic is whenever our preferences
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.200]   or the way that I think about someone,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.920]   based on where they're from, what college they went to,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.520]   what education they have, what family they grew up in,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.440]   good or bad, when I allow that to ascribe
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.960]   or begin to associate value,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   or how valuable or not valuable that person is,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.920]   it becomes incredibly catastrophic.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.480]   And so we're gonna talk what James has to say
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.220]   about the subject of how you and I are to treat one another,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.780]   and how you and I are to treat every person,
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.560]   just in general.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   The reason I think this issue is such a huge one,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.600]   think about how much a person's identity,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.960]   their gender, their age, their ethnicity,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.660]   is constantly being thrown in front of all of us,
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.080]   constantly thrown in front of all of us
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.980]   in a way that is oftentimes incredibly divisive.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.940]   And the body of Christ, unlike any other group of people
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.260]   on the planet, is to be a group that is united,
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.840]   not because we are uniform in how we look,
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.720]   but because we are united through Jesus to one another.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.400]   And James said, "If that mentality,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.580]   "if I treat you different because you look this way,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.140]   "or you are this way, or you have this,
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.080]   "you have begun to step into a serious sin
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.160]   "that God despises."
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.640]   So we're gonna be, in James chapter two,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.960]   if you have a Bible, you can flip open there,
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.560]   if not, it'll be up on the screens.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.840]   But we're gonna walk through three things.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.320]   The command that James gives as it relates to favoritism,
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.640]   the cause of that favoritism, and then the cure
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.440]   for how you and I can experience freedom from that.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.720]   James, if you haven't been tuning in,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.120]   is the half-brother of Jesus.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.600]   So Jesus grew up, had a little brother who saw him,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.120]   likely shared a room with him,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.520]   just 'cause everybody shared one room,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.080]   and he likely saw the journey of his brother
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.480]   that ended with him on the cross and resurrecting.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.600]   And after the resurrection, James came to faith,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.320]   and he writes this book covering all types of things
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.920]   he learned from his baby brother,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.160]   or from his older brother, Jesus.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.920]   We've covered trials week one, temptation week two,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.560]   last week, living according to your word,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.360]   and tonight, we're gonna cover how you and I,
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   the body of Christ, has no favorites.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.560]   There are no favorites that should mark our life,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.040]   and how we interact and treat one another.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.380]   He says this, verse one.
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.040]   "My brothers and sisters,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.840]   "believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   "must not show favoritism."
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.880]   In other words, or by favoritism,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   I mean ascribing value based on my preferences,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.460]   treating someone based on how my preferences
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.800]   or how I think about that person differently
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.880]   than I would someone else.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.680]   And then he gives an illustration.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.880]   He says, "Suppose a man comes into your meeting,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.920]   "comes into church, he's wearing a gold ring
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.820]   "and fine clothes, and a poor man comes in,
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.760]   "and he's wearing filthy old clothes.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.080]   "If you show special attention
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.380]   "to the man wearing fine clothes,
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.820]   "and you say, 'Here's a good seat for you,'
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.080]   "but you say to the poor man, 'You stand over there,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.200]   "'you sit on the floor by my feet,'
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.820]   "have you not discriminated among yourselves
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.000]   "and become judges with evil thoughts?"
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.720]   So he brings up the subject of favoritism.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.600]   He says, "Among Christians, this should not ever take place,"
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.280]   showing preferential treatment to people.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.480]   And he gives an illustration.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.680]   And a gold ring in that day and age
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.760]   would have been very unique.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.040]   It basically would be like the equivalent.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.980]   And today, he'd be like, "Look, imagine a guy shows up,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.680]   "he's got the Gucci buckle on,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.020]   "or he's walking in with Yeezys on,
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.960]   "or he's driving a G-Wagon here,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.160]   "and he's just got some look that gives away."
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.260]   Or a girl that shows up, she's wearing a,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.120]   I don't know what girls wear.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.900]   She's wearing golden goose shoes and a Birkin bag.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.440]   Let me just take a side note here.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.380]   When did we start making clothes
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.820]   that looked intentionally all nasty and tatted up and dirty?
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.740]   Literally, they came out of goodwill or something,
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.460]   and then we start selling them for $500.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.500]   That concept, I just still can't get my mind around
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.380]   called golden goose.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.420]   Men, if you don't know what that is, look around,
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.660]   and the tattiest, most tattered pair of shoes
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.380]   you probably see on a girl's feet are probably the O's
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.540]   and also the most expensive.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.440]   Anyways, point being, just fashion right now, man.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.280]   I just don't get it.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.100]   Point being, this person shows up,
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.400]   and inside of the church, and then there's somebody
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.440]   who shows up, and the word that's used to describe him
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.280]   is he's dirty, he's stinky.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.060]   It's a word that's synonymous with excrement,
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.720]   so he is dirty, and he's inside of the church,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.620]   and then you've got this guy, gold ring,
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.740]   or wearing whatever duds today would make sense,
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.040]   and the word that is used for the guy wearing the gold ring
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.460]   is literally a word that means shiny, which is so great.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.840]   I feel like there's a rap song
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.900]   that could have been made off of this.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.940]   I am shiny, and there's a shiny guy, dirty guy,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.380]   and he leads into,
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.100]   "When you begin to show preferential treatment
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.780]   "based on external appearance, based on how someone looks,
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.900]   "you have stepped into favoritism and sin,
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.520]   "whether for good or for bad."
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.280]   And he says, "Among the people of God,
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.060]   "this should not be present."
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.500]   So the first idea is the command, do not show favoritism.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.660]   It's crazy how often, just human nature, we do this,
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.920]   where we see somebody,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.460]   and you immediately begin to size them up,
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.700]   and you immediately begin to go through,
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.340]   and you're talking to them, and you learn more information,
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.820]   and you just run through the Rolodex
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.140]   of how important they are, how significant they are,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.060]   how you're gonna think about them,
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.660]   and even how you're gonna interact or treat them.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.500]   What do I mean by this?
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.100]   Tonight, afterwards, you're gonna be out in the lobby,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.140]   you're gonna be talking to somebody.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.060]   Let me tell you what the person
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.100]   on the other end of that conversation is gonna be doing.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.440]   You're gonna meet them for the first time,
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.780]   they're gonna say, "Oh, man, how did you hear
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.820]   "about the porch?"
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.980]   And they're just beginning the computing.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.860]   It's like they're Iron Man,
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.020]   seeing the stats that pop up as you tell your life.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.500]   And they're like, "Well, my friend invited me."
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.420]   And they're like, "Oh, interesting,
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.540]   "friends that are connected to each other.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.500]   "Where'd you go to college?"
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.620]   And their facial expression may not change that much,
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.380]   and they'll walk through, "Hey, where do you work?"
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.300]   And you respond with, "Well, I'm a teacher,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.260]   "or I'm in law school, or I work at Deloitte."
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.180]   And again, they're sizing up, how important is this person?
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.200]   "Where'd you go to college?"
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.540]   "Oh, big one right here."
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.000]   "Well, I went to Texas Tech."
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.300]   "Must be a part of your, oh, I went to TCU."
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.100]   "Bro comes from some money."
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.060]   "Oh, I went to Harvard, woo, cha-ching."
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.580]   And they're just sizing up one thing after the next,
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.140]   after the next, after the next.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.300]   "What are you doing after this?"
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.280]   "Well, I'm going to hang out with a couple friends."
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.140]   "Is one of them a girl?"
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:31.980]   And you're just going through like,
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.300]   "I wonder if he's single, is he not?"
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.660]   And they're just categorizing,
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.660]   and we just begin to ascribe and associate value,
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.460]   and that impacts how we're gonna treat that other person.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.220]   Some of you, candidly, like you do this,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.620]   and you do it in the negative way,
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.300]   where it wouldn't be somebody that shows up
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.540]   in poor, shabby clothes to you.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.500]   There's just people you don't like for whatever reason,
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.380]   and it's sin.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.380]   Like, some of you guys, you don't like artsy guys.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.220]   Like, you don't like artistic people,
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.100]   you're just like, "They're just weird, just don't get it."
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.540]   You think it's for whatever reason, you don't like it.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.820]   Some of you guys don't like athletic guys,
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.380]   'cause you're like, "Oh my gosh, yeah, barbell.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.380]   "I'm so over it, it's so annoying."
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.900]   And it's sin.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.980]   And you kind of exclude and you treat people different,
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.900]   and you judge them based on external appearances.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.740]   You don't know anything about them.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.940]   Some of you girls, you don't like skinny girls.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.340]   And you get around them, and you're like,
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.660]   you immediately rub them off, unless you get to know 'em.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.100]   You're like, "I can't believe it, oh my gosh.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.820]   "I would never wanna look like that.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.800]   "I mean, size two, that's gotta be horrible,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.220]   "and this is unbelievable that she thinks
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.060]   "she can join our party."
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.160]   And you don't like 'em.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.500]   There's people who, because of the car that they drive,
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.060]   you immediately judge and think of them differently,
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.340]   for better or for worse.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.780]   This can also happen where you begin
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.900]   to show preferential treatment,
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.020]   in terms of the girl or guy you're dating,
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.740]   on really superficial, shallow things.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.560]   Like, "Oh, he's a doctor."
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.220]   And that becomes the thing that makes you go,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.340]   "Oh, I'm interested."
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.740]   And James would say, "The way that you see people
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.800]   "is off, and it's Christians.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.980]   "We're not to see one another through the lens
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.160]   "of how the world sees us, or a value
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.640]   "that is a moving target, based on what
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.800]   "the world says matters.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.940]   "We are to see people entirely differently than that."
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.580]   And we're about to cover exactly what I mean by that.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.800]   Some of you think, so I'm gonna lean,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.260]   the most important thing about a person is their ethnicity.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.820]   Let me be abundantly clear.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.900]   A person's ethnicity, whether it's the,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.140]   "Here I am, and I'm so proud of this,"
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.980]   or "Here I am, and I hold that against that person
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.020]   "because they're of a different one,"
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.300]   compared to where they will spend eternity,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.460]   does not matter at all.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.780]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.820]   The most significant thing about someone
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.020]   is where they will spend eternity, not their ethnicity.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.380]   That doesn't mean they can't celebrate,
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.820]   or have ancestral heritage, or anything that they
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.380]   are thankful for that is in their life.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.020]   But when it comes to how you see yourself,
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.760]   how you see other people, it is a sick, toxic thing
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.440]   to think that if you are a sister and brother in Christ,
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.840]   you have a deeper connection to someone
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.440]   who shares your skin color than who shares
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.560]   the fact that you are related to Jesus
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.200]   and will be with them for all of eternity.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.840]   And you don't have to believe me now
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.040]   'cause you're gonna be together with whatever race you are,
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.120]   ethnicity you are, we're gonna be together
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.200]   for all of eternity, so you'll get there someday
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.440]   if you don't believe me now.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.640]   But the most important thing about someone
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.320]   is not the amount of melanin in their skin.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.200]   It's crazy.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.280]   And that type of thinking, when it seeps into the church,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.960]   is toxic, and James would say,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.320]   if you treat people differently based on how they look,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.520]   for better or for worse, it is sin.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.520]   And I know in the room, there's people who probably are like,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.320]   I can't believe you're, you don't have the right to say this
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.960]   'cause honestly, David, you're just some white guy
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.160]   standing up there telling me that.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.720]   I don't care.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.080]   The most important thing about you, you need to know.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.320]   It's not the color of your skin.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.720]   It's where you're gonna spend eternity.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.360]   It's a very relevant thing to your life
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.640]   and all of our lives, but it's not the most important thing.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.120]   And if you, conversely, if you think less of somebody
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.480]   because of their ethnicity,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.400]   if you think less of somebody because they're Asian
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.720]   or because they're black or because they're brown
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.960]   or because they're white,
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.920]   you are doing the exact thing that James said.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.440]   You're not to look at external appearances
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.680]   to form how you see someone.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.840]   And this happens on all sides.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.000]   Do I need to lean in even more here?
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.360]   And James says it is wrong.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.920]   If you look at somebody based on how much money
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.320]   that they make and you ascribe value, it's sin.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.200]   And you don't see like God sees.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.360]   Further, inside of the church,
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.440]   this has never, ever been okay.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.320]   To divide one another or to see one another
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.600]   or to focus on the differences
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.920]   and judge one another through that lens is tragic.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.480]   And the church has not always gotten this right,
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.880]   but it has always been called to
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.080]   because God doesn't see the way that we see.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.880]   In the 1950s, there was a guy named Billy Graham
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.160]   who led a bunch of crusades.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.880]   He went all over the country, all over the world.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.680]   He preached to more people in his lifetime
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.800]   than any other person who's ever lived.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.680]   Millions and millions of people.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.000]   In the 1950s, it was at the heart of a racial divide
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.280]   and tension in our nation that was enormous.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.680]   Segregation was legal.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.000]   Jim Crow was legal.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.360]   And Billy Graham would go on crusades.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.160]   In 1953, in Chattanooga, Tennessee,
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.080]   he showed up at a church.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.920]   He went inside the church
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.960]   and he was there to preach a crusade.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.360]   And he walked in and they had ropes
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.680]   that were dividing and segregating
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.440]   where different people based on their color
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.600]   would be able to sit.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.360]   And Billy went up to those ropes and said,
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.040]   "You either lose the ropes or you're gonna lose me.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.080]   "You either take these away or I'm going away."
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.160]   And they took him down.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.840]   And they did not tolerate.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.080]   This is where the people of God come together
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.360]   and they stand level at the foot of the cross.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.760]   Any Christian in history who has not agreed with that
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.360]   is wrong and in sin.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:24.200]   Mahatma Gandhi was a really influential figure
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.040]   in the 20th century.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.640]   One of the most influential of all time.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.520]   Tragically, he experienced something very different
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.360]   in his exposure to Christianity.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.280]   He writes in an autobiography about his experience
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.000]   and exposure to the church.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.360]   And he was studying and he was in college
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.120]   and he writes that he was studying Christianity.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.720]   And man, it's so powerful what he writes.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.240]   He basically says, when he was studying the gospels,
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.320]   he seriously considered converting to Christianity.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.400]   I believe that the teachings of Jesus
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.520]   could find the solution to the caste system
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.600]   that was dividing the people of India.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.440]   In other words, India, there's this caste system
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.400]   and based on kind of what caste or what group that you're in
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.520]   determines your life and where you can go in society
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   and laws that are applied to you.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.160]   And he read the teachings of Jesus in the Bible
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.360]   and he thought, man, if anybody can break down walls,
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.520]   it is this man.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.760]   These teachings may be able to transform India
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.840]   from what it is today and break down the caste system.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.320]   And he says, he went to a church.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.080]   One Sunday, I decided to attend services
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.880]   at a nearby church and talk to the minister
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.240]   about becoming a Christian.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.280]   When he entered the sanctuary, however,
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.200]   the usher refused to give him a seat
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   and suggested that he go back and worship
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.080]   with his own people.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.880]   Gandhi says, I left the church that morning,
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.240]   disillusioned, disappointment.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.760]   I decided not to return to a Christian church again
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.320]   saying if Christians have their own caste systems
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.560]   and play favoritism, I might as well remain a Hindu.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.200]   Think about the tragedy that was.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.280]   Someone who impacted millions and millions of people
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.360]   who had come and attempted and interested
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.240]   in becoming a Christian,
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.960]   turned away for something as silly as a Christian.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.000]   For something as silly as the color of his skin
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.080]   or where he was from.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.920]   Can you imagine God in heaven when he looks down
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.480]   seeing all things for all of eternity
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.280]   who made every single one of us in his image?
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.520]   Saying, really?
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.360]   Because he's got less or more melanin than you,
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.560]   that's how you're gonna divide things?
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.080]   That's so insane.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.960]   In any way that this line of thinking,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.720]   whether it's around ethnicity or it's around
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.440]   where someone went to college or their background
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.320]   or their education level begins to creep into the church,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.200]   it's toxic, it's sick, it's sin, and it is evil, James says.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.280]   Comes from an evil place.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.840]   That's what he says in the verse.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.880]   So he gives the command and then he gives the cause.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.480]   Says this, my dear brothers and sisters,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.500]   has not God chosen those who are poor
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.400]   in this world to be rich in faith?
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.720]   He's quoting from the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.320]   Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.600]   "for they shall inherit the earth."
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.560]   To inherit the kingdom, he's promised to those who love him.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.440]   He didn't promise it to the poor,
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.280]   he promised it to those who love him.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   But you have dishonored the poor.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.920]   Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.560]   So he's talking about a group of people
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.520]   who weren't believers that were exploiting
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.000]   some of the more poor Christians.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.600]   Are they not the ones dragging you in court?
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.920]   Are they not the ones blaspheming the noble name
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.000]   of him to whom you belong?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.160]   So he brings up the point, and the point is not rich or poor.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   His point is, hey, it's those who love him
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.080]   who will inherit the kingdom.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.120]   His point is, you see people wrongly.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.480]   You see people based on this earthly, worldly perspective
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.840]   where you see you got poor people, you got rich people.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.020]   God doesn't see like that.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.760]   God doesn't see through the lens and the spectrum
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.800]   of the way that the world sees around us.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.120]   There are poor people in this world
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.140]   who will live in poverty their entire life.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.500]   Some of them will live in third world countries
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.880]   their entire life who will spend eternity
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.320]   as billionaire, billionaire, billionaires.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.280]   Maybe it's some of the wealthiest people you have ever met
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.760]   or some of the most blue-collar, just faithful servants
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.040]   of God that you've bumped into who love Jesus.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   And there are billionaires in this world
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.240]   who will be bankrupt for all of eternity in hell.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.600]   And James is saying, God doesn't see through the lens.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.760]   Everything that you think is important,
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.400]   God doesn't think is important.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.160]   All the way that you treat people based on these
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.920]   superficial, silly, dumb things
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.920]   or insignificant in the eternal perspective things.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.280]   He doesn't see people like the way that you see them.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.400]   And you are not to treat people
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.880]   because the reason that you and I treat people differently
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.960]   is we don't see as God sees.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.160]   So we hold onto things that he would say
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.360]   it's just not important.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.280]   Every single person you've ever met
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.040]   is someone of infinite value.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.240]   Someone who the angels long to look into
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.960]   and see that person come to church.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.440]   First Corinthians six says that humans
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.760]   will judge the angels someday.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.600]   Think about that.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.040]   The angelic realm looks at you
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.240]   if you're a follower of Christ
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.680]   and the wonder and the glory that awaits you
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.440]   makes them awe or sit in long to look in
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.360]   is what first Peter two says.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.200]   Long to see.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.680]   You have no idea how infinitely value you are
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.200]   in every person you've ever met.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.880]   The infinite value and potential that they have
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.720]   is someone who's made in the image of God.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.260]   A future daughter or son of God almighty.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.540]   I mean, think about that.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.780]   If we could for a second see how valuable,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.500]   how every single person you've ever,
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.580]   the person who bagged your groceries,
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.140]   the person that's gonna wait your table at Torchy's
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.140]   after this or pick up your table at Torchy's after this,
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.020]   the person that you live next to,
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.380]   the person that is in the cube next to you,
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.420]   your boss, every one of them
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.300]   is someone of literally infinite value
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.460]   because Jesus was willing to die on the cross
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.900]   to give his eternal life for that person.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.900]   And it's crazy, like if Tim Tebow was here tonight
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.840]   or whatever the girl equivalent of that is,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.780]   there would be a huge line of people waiting.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.420]   They're like, oh man, I wanna take a picture of Tim Tebow.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.600]   Look, Tim Tebow.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.420]   And again, whatever the girl equivalent of that is,
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.460]   because you'd wanna meet and see and be around that person.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.400]   Every person you're around
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.660]   is of such infinite, extraordinary value
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.460]   because they're made in the image of God,
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.820]   regardless of what they can do
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.620]   with a ball made out of pigskin sewn together.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.580]   They're of infinite value
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.860]   because they're someone that Jesus said,
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.220]   I love them so much, I died for them.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.580]   Every person you've ever been eyeball to eyeball with
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.380]   is gonna spend eternity somewhere,
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.220]   either perfected and glorified with Jesus
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.180]   or in hell apart from.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.260]   And that same wonder that you would have
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.880]   of I can't believe I get to meet that person,
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.180]   you should know that is what every person around you
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.460]   ever is.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.620]   Uniquely in all creation, God made a lot of cool stuff.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.380]   He made the Aurora Borealis,
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.180]   He made the Grand Canyon, He made oceans,
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.460]   He made all kinds of cool stuff.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.260]   None of that stuff makes God say,
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.360]   whoa, this is the crown of my creation.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.860]   None of that stuff did He give His life for.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.580]   You, on the other hand,
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.460]   you're the one that He says, man,
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.000]   you're the apple of my eye, so to speak,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.940]   the most valuable thing that could ever be,
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.640]   both for you and for every person you've ever disrespected,
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.100]   treated poorly, ignored, ghosted,
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.880]   and not seen as God sees.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.920]   And He says, man, you gotta understand
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.620]   and see people differently.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.760]   Some of you, when you think through the lens of dating,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.340]   it's so relevant to dating 'cause you're like,
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.740]   oh, you just see, like, man, he's got a trust fund,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.940]   or she's got a trust fund,
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.180]   or I'm marrying into this really nice family.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.860]   And there are people who are gonna be married
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.000]   and rich in this life.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.700]   And people get married 'cause they're concerned
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.120]   about how much is in their bank account.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.100]   They're not concerned about how much of God has their heart,
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:14.200]   or how much money they have in the bank
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.240]   versus how much God has of them.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.140]   And when you make that deal and you take that bet
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.360]   for superficial, shallow, worldly reasons, it's costly.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.600]   And James says, that's not how people who know Jesus think.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.580]   The idea of the image of God,
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.900]   I've referenced already several times,
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.060]   but Genesis chapter one, verse 26 and 27 says,
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.620]   "So He created mankind in His own image.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.980]   "In the image of God, He created the male and female."
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.840]   And James says, man, you're looking at people.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.780]   Don't see them through the worldly lens that you're seeing.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.660]   Looks can be deceiving.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.900]   There's a bit on Jimmy Kimmel Live
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.980]   where he has Drake and Miley Cyrus
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.420]   and different people come out and they do eyewitness news.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.780]   And I think we may have a pic of it,
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.500]   where this is Drake in undercover
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.860]   and he's out interviewing people.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.860]   It's honestly a genius bit 'cause he goes out
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.220]   and he's totally undercover and he just dogs Drake.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.980]   He's like, man, what do you think about Drake?
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.100]   He's pretty terrible, huh?
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.360]   And the guy just goes back and forth.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.540]   And the people are like, yeah, man, I've never liked him.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.540]   And I can't believe you did that.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.900]   And honestly, this dude has not got talent.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.900]   That's a problem.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.100]   And he's like, yeah, yeah, man, no talent.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.020]   That guy needs to find another hobby or something.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.000]   And he walks through all of that.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.620]   And then at the end, he takes off the mask
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.400]   and the guy realizes who I thought I was talking to
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.120]   was not who I was talking to.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.740]   There's gonna come a day in eternity.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.820]   We're gonna finally fully see, as God says,
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.500]   and realize who we thought we were talking to
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.100]   was not who we were talking to.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.460]   And every person you will ever see
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.980]   is someone who will spend eternity somewhere
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:57.540]   and is of infinite value, whether you believe it or not,
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.880]   and is worthy and deserving of respect.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.900]   You know how frustrated I get
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.020]   when people don't treat my kids well?
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.060]   Like my son, he's on a tee ball team right now.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.260]   He plays tee ball and it's one of the first times
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.100]   I'm not coaching a team and I'm watching it.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.500]   And I'm like, man, why are you not putting him at second?
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.140]   Or why are you just sitting out this inning?
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.060]   You need to put him out there.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.620]   And I'm just kind of going through the Rolodex of like,
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.020]   hey, you need to put my son out there.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.900]   Because I care deeply about how people treat
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.140]   or how my kids are doing.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.620]   God has called a father
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.020]   of all those who put their trust in him.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.860]   A father who invites anyone and everyone
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.180]   to come have a relationship with him.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.140]   How much more does he think?
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.940]   When you ghosted that girl,
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.320]   dude, you think about who her dad is.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.660]   Anybody ever dated a girl or girl whose dad was like,
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.420]   man, have her home by seven.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.180]   That's the God who's there.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.280]   And vice versa on both sides.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.580]   Jesus said in Matthew chapter 25,
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.940]   a really interesting statement.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.940]   He says, there's gonna come a day
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.100]   where at the end of the age,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.500]   I'm gonna separate the sheep and the goats.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.540]   He uses this analogy and it's like sheep and the goats.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.140]   And the sheep will be on the right side,
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.100]   spend eternity with God.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.300]   Then the goats, and he uses a farming illustration
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.100]   'cause he grew up on a farm.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.820]   They're gonna spend eternity away from God.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.520]   Here's how you'll know that you were among those
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.020]   who will spend eternity with God.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.860]   And they asked, what did we do for you?
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:25.340]   And he said, I was hungry, I was thirsty, I was lonely,
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.140]   and you visited me, you cared for me.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.700]   You gave me something to drink, something to eat.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.880]   And it says, the people of God will go,
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.720]   when did we do that?
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.640]   And he said, whenever you did this for the least of these,
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.880]   you were doing it for me.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:40.040]   But Jesus says,
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.160]   man, you don't know who you're interacting with.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.280]   And every person is someone worthy,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.880]   dignity, respect, being treated as such.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.440]   And the reason that doesn't happen is we see
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.520]   as the world says, not as God's word calls us to.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:00.800]   Jesus was told, or was even said by some of his enemies,
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.320]   and move quickly, that they said, we know,
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.960]   this is Jesus's enemies even said,
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.120]   you just are not swayed by the opinions of people.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:08.960]   You don't think about people
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.920]   the way the world thinks about people.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.520]   It says this, Matthew 22, verse 15.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.600]   We know that you are a man of integrity, Jesus,
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.520]   that you teach the word of God in accordance with truth.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.640]   You're not swayed by others,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.240]   and you pay no attention to who they are.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.920]   When you understand and you look at people
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.140]   like God says who they are, you begin to look like God,
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.240]   looking at their infinite value
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.660]   and looking at not just their external appearance
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.080]   or their appearance, but their heart and who they are.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.280]   Matthew, or I'm sorry, 1 Samuel chapter 16,
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.660]   verse seven says this.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.320]   People look at the outward appearance,
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.560]   but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:53.160]   He doesn't see the way the world sees.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.200]   And as Christians, we're called to not see that way either,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.800]   but to see every person is valuable
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.420]   and to look past the superficial, skin deep things.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:10.000]   Finally, he gives us the cure to the sin of partiality.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.880]   He says, if you really keep the royal law
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.600]   found in scripture, what's the royal law, James?
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.720]   You're doing right.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:25.320]   But if you show favoritism, you sin
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.360]   and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.400]   Whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.080]   at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.200]   For he who said, you shall not commit adultery
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.280]   also said you shall not murder.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.920]   If you do not commit adultery, but you commit murder,
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.520]   you become a lawbreaker.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.000]   Speak and act as those who will be judged
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.720]   by the law that gives freedom.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:57.960]   Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.200]   who has not been merciful.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.160]   Mercy triumphs.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.000]   Mercy triumphs over judgment.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.200]   So he takes a lot and covers a lot there.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.800]   He lays out first the royal law.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.920]   He basically gives a solution and the cure
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.880]   to the problem of favoritism and the action
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   and response that is to mark believers
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.200]   is that you and I are to love people.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.040]   That's the cure.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.080]   That's the third idea from the text.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.320]   He says, this is what is called the royal law.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.280]   Why would you call it the royal law?
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.080]   Jesus, who is the King of Kings, in Matthew 22 was asked,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.120]   what's the most important commandment there is?
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.360]   And he replies, it says, love God
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.560]   with all of your heart, strength, mind, and soul,
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.360]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.000]   And then he says, all of the Old Testament
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.900]   can be summarized in these two things.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.260]   It's the royal law 'cause it's given by the King of Kings.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.720]   It's also, you could say the royal law
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.120]   because it's the law that rules over every other law.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.140]   If you fulfill or you do that one,
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.280]   all the other ones are gonna follow inside of it.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.120]   Romans chapter 13 says that law or love
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.100]   is the fulfillment of the law.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.120]   All of the commands can be summed up in this one command,
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.960]   love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.740]   Everything, first half of your Bible,
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.040]   all of it summed up in a sentence of love people
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.420]   and treat them the way that you would like to be treated.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.160]   When it comes to how you think about them,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.040]   regardless of how they look, where they work,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.320]   where they're from, what they've done,
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.080]   that you would treat them and care for them
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.320]   and be someone who thinks about them,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.720]   speaks about them, acts towards them
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.300]   in a way that you would want to be acted towards,
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.000]   spoken to, thought about.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.080]   He brings up an idea that is an interesting one
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.640]   where he says, if you break any of these,
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.560]   you've broken all of them.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.000]   He says, if you stumble at just one point,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.400]   you're guilty of breaking all of it.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.980]   How can you say that, James?
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.960]   Are you saying that murder is synonymous with favoritism?
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.080]   In terms of the fact that it's breaking God's law
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.480]   'cause God, who also said don't murder,
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.240]   said don't show favoritism, yes,
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.160]   in that sense it is.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.560]   It's not the same and there's consequences
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.040]   and that in one scenario, someone dies.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.840]   In another scenario, someone is disrespected.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:13.360]   So in a immediate consequence, they're not the same.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.640]   But in terms of breaking God's command,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.440]   you are a lawbreaker.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.800]   You have broken the law.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.200]   In other words, if you were hanging off the side of a cliff
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.440]   and you held onto a chain that was holding you above
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.520]   from falling on the ground
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.040]   and a single link in that chain breaks,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.760]   you're gonna fall.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.920]   If you sin one time, he's just saying,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.200]   hey, you've become a sinner, you're a lawbreaker.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.040]   If you steal one time, are you a thief?
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.840]   If not, when do you become a thief?
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.680]   And that's his point.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.920]   He's just saying, hey, you have fallen short.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.520]   You have broken God's law.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.840]   You've become a lawbreaker.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:53.000]   And he equates it in a pretty serious category
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.620]   of adultery, murder, and favoritism,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.040]   that it is a big deal to God.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:05.240]   Christians, and the jersey that is to mark
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.760]   and to be on, Christians, is that of love.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.360]   And I'm gonna explain even what I mean by that in a second,
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.000]   but what I mean by the jersey,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.720]   Jesus said in John chapter 13,
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.220]   by this one thing,
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:19.800]   everyone will know that you're my follower,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.640]   that you love one another.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.080]   That's gonna be the thing, the world looks on
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.040]   and they're like, man, the way they treat each other
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.880]   is just different.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.720]   Like, it's not normal, or we act in one way,
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.160]   but they act in a different way,
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.500]   and they're gonna be able to identify
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.440]   you're different from them.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.080]   My son, last fall, was playing soccer,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.900]   and we were doing YMCA soccer with a bunch of four-year-olds
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.240]   which is chaotic in and of itself,
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.160]   which is mass herds of cats back and forth
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.480]   waiting for Capri Sun.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.960]   And at the end of our game,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.440]   there was another team, or two other teams
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.600]   that were playing after us, and they came up,
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.480]   and they both had red jerseys on, like identical.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.640]   Identical red jerseys.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.420]   And I was sitting there watching, I was like,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.520]   how, it's already mass chaos, like, run, Bobby, run, run.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.360]   What is that, a flower?
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.640]   And then you're trying to, you know,
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.800]   get them to move different directions.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   When they're all wearing the same thing,
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.200]   none of the kids can tell each other apart
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.040]   and know who's on my team, and it's just total chaos.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.620]   Because without being able to identify and recognize,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.780]   oh, they're different,
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.720]   they just blend in with everybody else.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.000]   How many Christians, when it comes to the way
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.160]   that they're supposed to wear the jersey
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.040]   and be marked by something that makes them stand out,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.440]   they look like everybody else in the world around us.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.800]   The idea of, hey, be a loving person,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.920]   that's not a message that is unique to Christianity.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.440]   Actually being a loving person
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.840]   is something that is a unique thing to see,
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.920]   especially when it comes to being a loving person
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.160]   in the way the Bible describes love,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.420]   which is only those who have experienced the love of God
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.620]   through Christ can be and live a life
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.100]   that flows of love towards other people,
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.540]   not just to love them, to get a good feeling for what I did,
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.460]   but actually out of a response to God's love.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.020]   It's something only Christians can wear.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.820]   And how many Christians claim to be followers of Christ,
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.460]   and yet when you look at their life,
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.440]   they look like everybody else.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.420]   They don't give generously, they don't give differently,
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.420]   they don't spend their time differently,
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.260]   they don't care for their family differently,
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.980]   they don't use their mouth differently,
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.100]   they're not different at work,
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.500]   they blend in with everybody else.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.240]   And Jesus says the jersey that is to mark followers
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.900]   of Christ is that they are those who love people around them.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.860]   What do I mean by love?
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   The Bible actually describes and defines,
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.000]   this is what love should look like,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.180]   'cause everybody says love.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.200]   Ellen DeGeneres is like, you know what we need?
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.500]   Love, sweet love.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.260]   Everybody thinks that they have the corner
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.500]   on the market on love.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.900]   Christians have a foundation that we love
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.100]   because God first loved us.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.020]   Everybody else, any other worldview,
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.340]   or an atheistic worldview,
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   you love just 'cause people tell you to.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.060]   And that could change any day or any moment.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.140]   Christians have a command from God himself
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.740]   that says you are to love people
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.320]   when they can do nothing for you in return,
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.240]   because God first loved you.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.100]   That's what 1 John chapter four says.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.180]   1 Corinthians chapter 13 says this,
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.140]   here's how you know what love.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.620]   This is what you and I should be wearing
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.360]   and our lives should look like,
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.400]   and strive to look like,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.860]   and the more that you and I walk with God,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.560]   the more that they will look like,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.120]   love is patient.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.960]   Love is kind.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.040]   It does not envy.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.280]   It doesn't boast.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.920]   It's not proud.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.720]   In other words, if there's ever a moment
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.600]   where I'm not being patient,
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.540]   I'm not being kind,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.080]   I'm being envious or jealous,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.320]   I'm boasting about, hey, do you know,
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.160]   I'm kind of a big deal.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.320]   I'd like to tell you some of my stuff,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.120]   me, myself, and I.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.360]   I'm not acting in love.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:47.920]   It's not proud.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.440]   It does not dishonor others.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.220]   Anytime you dishonor someone,
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.240]   you're not loving.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.160]   It's a pretty powerful thing to think about.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.160]   Who'd you dishonor today?
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.000]   On Facebook, on Instagram, at work,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.900]   behind their back?
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.960]   Says, you're not wearing the jersey.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.480]   You look like everybody else.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   It's not self-seeking.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.520]   How much does our world need to hear that?
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.160]   How much do I need to hear that?
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.360]   It's not easily angered.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   It keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.780]   Doesn't hold things against people.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.660]   Love does not delight in evil,
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.200]   but it rejoices with the truth.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.280]   It always protects.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.400]   It always trusts.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.000]   It always hopes and always perseveres,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.080]   and never ends.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.480]   Love never fails.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.960]   But James says, you and I are to love
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.160]   and be marked by the quality and characteristic of love.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.240]   That's the cure for favoritism,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.520]   and that is the appropriate response
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.320]   to every person you've ever met,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.260]   whether they're attractive to you, unattractive to you,
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.180]   whether they look like you, they don't look like you.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.440]   That is to be the quality or the characteristic
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.880]   that is to mark your relationship with that person.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.020]   He brings up a really interesting sentence at the end
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.180]   where he talks about justice.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.720]   Judgment and mercy.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:23.460]   He says, if you are the type of person
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:28.260]   that passes judgment on other people,
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.500]   instead of being merciful to them,
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.740]   and you don't extend mercy to people,
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.240]   you will not be extended mercy.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.420]   James, what are you saying?
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.820]   I could not be a Christian,
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.900]   or I could lose my faith and relationship with God?
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.500]   No, he's saying if you have been someone
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.100]   who's received mercy from God,
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.500]   you put your faith in Jesus on the cross,
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.860]   dying in your place, rising from the dead,
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.540]   that you believe I don't earn, I don't deserve
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.860]   relationship with God, got it one way,
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.780]   because Jesus paid for me on the cross.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.120]   He said, I will go in your place.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.660]   Everything you did is messed up.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.760]   Every sin that you've ever committed,
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.100]   every pornography look that you've ever had, David,
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.660]   everything that is part of a sexual past you've ever had,
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.140]   every time you've gotten drunk,
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.380]   every time that you've had an abortion in your past,
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.980]   whatever your story is, he would say,
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.460]   all of it I paid for on the cross,
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.140]   and you, by saying I have received the mercy of God,
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.740]   I'm putting my faith in what you did for me on the cross.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.260]   He says, when a person receives that mercy,
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.180]   I don't deserve it, but it's mine.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.780]   They are someone who extends mercy.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.580]   They give people the benefit of the doubt.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.580]   They care for people, they love people, they forgive people.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.940]   How interesting, when you think about the topic
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.820]   of injustice and mercy, what comes to mind?
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:48.580]   Maybe the best picture of someone who extends mercy
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.120]   in the face of horrific injustice is Jesus,
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:58.700]   who one day, while he was out teaching,
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.140]   comes and he's with his disciples,
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.540]   he's arrested, he's brought in, he's beaten,
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.740]   and he stands before a Roman pagan named Pontius Pilate,
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.980]   and he stands there, and Pilate says,
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.900]   are you the king of the Jews?
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.020]   And he walks him through, and he says,
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.500]   basically, I can find nothing wrong with this guy.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.940]   And he turns him back over to the people who said,
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.780]   you know, Pilate, we want you to arrest him and take him in,
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.620]   and he says, there's nothing wrong,
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.740]   he didn't do anything wrong, even while he's here,
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.540]   there's no fault I can find, I'm gonna release him.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.540]   And they say, don't release him.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.700]   And there's this big crowd that begins to gather around,
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.780]   and they begin to yell, crucify him, crucify him,
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.940]   crucify him, and they call for the death penalty.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.580]   A guy who's been teaching all week
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.380]   with this group of people with the city of Jerusalem,
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.340]   and they're calling for the death penalty at this moment,
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.860]   that we thought you were gonna be different.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.100]   Crucify him, crucify him.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.940]   The perfect son of God,
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:53.060]   having the death penalty called for in his life,
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.980]   a man who had done nothing wrong, sinless his entire life,
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.380]   had given sight to the blind, allowed lame people to walk,
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.780]   allowed beggars to be lifted out of poverty,
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.540]   brought sick people back to life,
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.900]   allowed the mute to speak, healed lepers,
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.140]   transformed lives, restored families together,
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.180]   is being called for the death penalty?
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.020]   And it gets worse.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.940]   He's taken, he's beaten, he has a place,
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.180]   or a crown of thorns placed on his head.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.980]   He's led to be crucified on two wooden pieces.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.300]   And his hands are nailed into that wood,
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.460]   and he's lifted up.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:33.220]   In the face of the greatest injustice ever,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.940]   what does he respond with?
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.460]   Mercy.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.740]   He says in Luke chapter 24, 23,
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:50.740]   hanging on a cross for sins he didn't commit,
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.900]   you committed, and I committed.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.040]   He looks at those who had just nailed his hands
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.000]   into that wood and says, "Father, forgive them.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.580]   "They don't know what they're doing.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.900]   "Father, give them mercy."
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.540]   When Christians in the face of injustice respond with mercy,
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.940]   they look like Jesus.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.100]   Let me be really clear.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:19.140]   There's a lot of calls for justice in our world right now.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:24.140]   There's a lot of angry, upset, in every direction,
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.540]   with racial division, political division,
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.380]   and whatever the division is,
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:35.160]   and there's a lot of loud calls for justice as Christians.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.000]   The volume which we call for mercy should be louder
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.960]   than the volume we call for justice for.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:43.800]   Why?
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.520]   Because we know that according to Romans chapter 12,
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.560]   and all throughout the Bible, there will come a day
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.200]   that every sin, there will be justice for it.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.400]   God says in Romans chapter 12,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.900]   "Do not avenge yourself or take revenge.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.220]   "Leave it to the wrath of God.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.080]   "It is written, 'Vengeance is mine,'
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.240]   "says the Lord, 'I will repay.'"
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.120]   That day is coming.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.480]   Every sin ever committed, everyone caught on camera,
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.840]   everyone not caught on camera, will give an account,
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.280]   will pay for the sin and the actions that they've taken.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.680]   And as Christians, the volume which we cry,
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.600]   even an injustice to ourself, how crazy is that,
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.280]   should be louder than the volume
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.480]   that we cry for justice for,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.880]   because it's what our Savior did.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.220]   And when this happens, it's astonishing.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.980]   Six years ago, almost exactly, or in a month or two,
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.860]   and I'm laying on the plane, in Charleston, South Carolina,
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.000]   nine people were brutally murdered
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.360]   by a racist, evil person who made God
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.600]   get ahold of his heart.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.260]   He walked in to a church and he killed brutally
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.180]   nine different people.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.700]   He was a white guy, killed nine different people
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.680]   who were black.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.700]   Horrific evil.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:59.540]   Almost immediately after, family member after family member
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.660]   got up and in response at the deposition said,
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.020]   I'm gonna read one of them.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:10.180]   From Nadine Collier, the daughter of a 70-year-old
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.860]   Ethel Lance, who was killed.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:16.100]   "You took something from me very precious,"
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.400]   speaking to the person who killed her mom.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.380]   "I'll never talk to her again.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.900]   "I will never hold her again.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.980]   "But I forgive you.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:28.280]   "May God have mercy on your soul."
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.420]   In the face of injustice, she called for mercy
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.660]   and in doing so, she looked like Jesus.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:40.360]   We're in a weird, crazy time where there's so much division.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.180]   But one thing that has gotta be abundantly clear
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.260]   is as followers of Jesus, no matter what is taking place
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.400]   around us, we don't listen to what the world says,
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.240]   we listen to what God's word says.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.660]   And we call for mercy.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:56.300]   In the midst of the tragedy of George Floyd,
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.100]   which is all taking place right now.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.020]   We pray for mercy.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.220]   That God had gotten a hold of his heart
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.420]   and he's in eternity with him.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:06.660]   No matter what you think.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.740]   That God would get a hold of his family,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.220]   that God would get a hold of everybody.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.500]   Derek Chauvin, you know who loves George Floyd
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.100]   and Derek Chauvin?
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.660]   Jesus.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.380]   Whatever the worst person that you infill in the blank,
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.820]   you can't believe that, that you right now
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.640]   are thinking through your minds,
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.580]   I can't believe that you would even say that,
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.980]   and why would you call for mercy?
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:26.580]   You know how arrogant and bigoted it sounds
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.380]   for you to say, I would rather someone spend
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.420]   all of eternity in hell, because I'm angry
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.460]   about what someone did.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.980]   And there's a place where the heart of God,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.580]   there will be justice.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.780]   Every sin will be paid for in eternity in hell,
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.220]   on the cross by Jesus Christ.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.520]   But when any of us say for anyone, towards anyone,
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.220]   I hope that they go to hell forever.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.260]   You think that's the spirit of Christ?
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.340]   Who says, Father, forgive them.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.580]   They crucify me, they kill me.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.100]   And this has gone too far into the church.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.720]   We have to be people who say, no matter what we face,
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.220]   we're gonna love each other, we're gonna care each other,
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.580]   we're gonna call for mercy.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.560]   That doesn't mean there's not a justice system.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.380]   But God, would you, in your mercy,
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.420]   get a hold of their eternity and change their heart?
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.940]   And because I think that my sin is not as bad
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.040]   as someone else's sin, would you change any part of me
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.980]   that believes that?
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:24.940]   If you've never had a moment,
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.540]   will you put your faith in Jesus?
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.980]   The greatest gift is to receive that mercy yourself.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.460]   You can't give it until you've received it.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.560]   By saying, God, I believe I'm a sinner
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.780]   and I'm putting my faith in what you did
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.680]   for me on the cross.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.860]   You died for me, you rose again,
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.180]   and I'm gonna be with you forever,
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.860]   not 'cause I deserve it, 'cause you paid for it
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.580]   and I accept it.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.680]   Tonight is your night.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.500]   Let me pray.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.060]   Father, I thank you that you are a God.
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.300]   I thank you that you are a God
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.380]   who in the face of being brutally killed,
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.500]   cried for mercy.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:08.540]   The insane reality of that is beyond my ability
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.740]   to even comprehend.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:19.040]   We live in a time that is desperately sick,
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.300]   and the church uniquely offers the solution
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.180]   of healing and unity and hope,
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.380]   and I pray that you would help us to do that,
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.620]   that we would be people who love one another
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.880]   like we wanna be loved, like you loved us,
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.380]   that we wouldn't show favorites,
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.900]   that we wouldn't treat one another differently,
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.620]   and you would help us to see each person we cross paths with
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.940]   like you see them,
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.220]   no matter who they are, how they look,
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.120]   what they've done, where they're from.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.460]   I pray for anyone who's never received mercy,
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.740]   a gift of mercy tonight,
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.740]   that you would allow them to take that step,
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.060]   have eternity, their eternity,
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.360]   forever changed by putting their faith in you.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.300]   As they listen even right now
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.420]   and they know that this is the moment,
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.860]   would you grab hold of their heart?
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.460]   For any parts of our hearts
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.060]   that are not quick to extend mercy,
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.280]   would you forgive us and help us, God?
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.500]   We love you and we worship you now in song,
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:26.220]   thanking you that your mercy triumphs over judgment, amen.
