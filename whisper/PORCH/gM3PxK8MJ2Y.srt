1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 All right, let's do it.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 How we doing, PORCH?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Night two, week two of our James series.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 As we are looking at the book of James going verse by verse.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Studying through a book of the Bible together.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Last week we talked all about trials and how God uses trials

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 to test our faith.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 To create more maturity in the believer.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 To depend on him more.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And tonight we are hopping into temptation.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 But before we do that, a quick welcome to some really important

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 friends tuning in with us live.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Please give a warm welcome to our PORCH live, CINCI, PORCH

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 live Tulsa and friends in the room.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Help us welcome for the first time a new PORCH live location,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 PORCH Des Moines, Iowa.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Iowa.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I love it.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Two PORCH live locations in Iowa.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 It's crazy, who knew.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And so of course my friends here tonight also in Dallas, what's

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 up, so glad we are here.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Just want to say right off the bat, I have been talking really

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 weird today.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I have no idea what is about to come out of this mouth.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Moses had a stutter, God used him pretty well.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 We'll see what happens.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But before we get going any further, we are committed to

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 taking you guys verse by verse through this.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I want to start by reading the text we are going to study

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 tonight.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 If you would open up your word to James 1.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 James 1, like I said last week, trials and testing of our faith.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 How God puts testing moments in our lives.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And God does that for a greater purpose to bring us to him in

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 our suffering.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But tonight we are talking about the idea of temptation.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Something given to us not by God.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Testing is used to develop us.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 But temptation is used to defeat us.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And the source of our temptation is not God, it's something else.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And that's what we are going to learn tonight from the book of

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 James.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 James 1, verse 13.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Let's read.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 You there?

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Everyone there?

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We good?

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Sweet.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 It's on the screens if you don't have your Bible.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 When tempted, no one should say God is tempting me.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 For God cannot be tempted by evil.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Nor does he tempt anyone.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 own evil desire and enticed.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Don't be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 father of the heavenly lights who does not change like shifting

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 shadows.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 He chose to give us birth through the word of truth that we

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 might be a kind of first fruits of all he created.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Lots there.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But tonight tackling temptation.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And it is really important that you track with me tonight.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 If you have questions, raise your hand.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I'm just kidding.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But temptation is really important to cover.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 When I was thinking about the process of learning how to fight

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 temptation, I was thinking about our spiritual journey as

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 followers of Jesus.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And a lot of times the correlation between one's

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 spiritual journey often aligns with the correlation of one's

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 physical journey.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 There is a lot of times in the Bible where our physical journey

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 and how we train our bodies and treat our bodies and use our

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 bodies for the glory of God and health and fitness and different

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 things.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And we are all on our spiritual journey.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And for me, I think like a lot of us, I found myself 2021, this

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 was my year to get fit.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 That's what I was like, okay, this is my year.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I will start a physical journey and have that summer bod like we

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 all want and it's coming up quicker than I thought.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And working out.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And all of those different things.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And then people that are really in the gym a lot, like the

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 majority of people, 90% of getting fit is in the kitchen.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And I am like, no, not for me, not for this guy.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 That's not true.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I can get it all up in the gym and working on my fitness, he's

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 my witness.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And so after time, working out double hard, I work out double

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 hard in the gym so I don't have to do the whole kitchen thing,

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 the dieting thing.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It didn't work.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And I was like, I have to start the diet and be a disciplined

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 person in my life.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And so in my physical journey, destination summer bod over

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 there.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I'm walking, working out, denying different candies and

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 snacks at parties and gatherings.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And then there's this one thing, one thing that every single time

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 tends to just get me off track.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And it's these.

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Chocolate chip cookies, my favorite dessert.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I don't need pie, I don't need cake, I don't need anything

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 else.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I just need a good chocolate chip cookie.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And as I'm on my journey of getting, you know, dieting and

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 all those different things, you know, our sweet co-worker Ramsey

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Pittman over here, she brings things like this into the office.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And here's where temptation in my physical journey tends to look

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 like.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I tend to do one of these, you know, and I'm like looking at it

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 and I'm like, what up, girl.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Because these cookies, man, they're not just any cookies.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 They have the perfect sea salt on top.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 The perfect not too chocolatey.

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 You know what I'm talking about?

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 The perfect combination of batter and chocolate chip.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 When you bite it, it's not too gooey, not too crunchy.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 It's the perfect sweet spot.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 She has it down to a T.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Fellas, these cookies could be yours every week by asking Ramsey

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Pittman out on a date.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Just kidding.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 But really, you could.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Not today.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But then I start to think about it and I'm like, oh, just one.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And we all know that one cookie is never enough.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Maybe one more.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Maybe another after dinner if I'm feeling a little something.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Yeah.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And I find myself caving every now and then.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And after a few cookies, because I've been trying not to eat

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 sweets, even though I have a major sweet tooth, I find myself

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 sick because I gave in.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And I start there because I think a lot of times temptation

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 can look the same.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's not cookies.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 But in our spiritual journey we have a destination to look more

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 like God, to do more things for the Lord, to be honoring and use

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 our lives to steward for the glory of God and to live for him.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And like how I'm walking towards my destination and these cookies

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 seem to always get me off track.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 In the same way, sin wants to get me off track from my pursuit of

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 God.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And that begins in the form of temptation.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 So before we go any further of what James has to say about

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 temptation, I just want to define it really clearly for us.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Here is a definition of temptation.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Temptation is the moment when you mentally acknowledge the

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 option to choose sin or to choose God.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Okay.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 One more time.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 It's really important you understand this.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Temptation is the moment when you mentally acknowledge the

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 option to choose sin or to choose God.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 It's the moment when you are deciding, you are weighing the

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 implications of do I go after what the world is calling out for

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 me to do, what sin, my flesh, what Satan is calling for me to

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 do or do I choose to trust God with the results of my life.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It's when you find yourself at the crossroad of choosing

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 yourself to be Lord of your own life or choosing God.

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And in that crossroad, a lot of us I think talk about what it

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 looks like to be in an abiding relationship with God and a lot

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 of us talk about what it looks like to how you go back to God

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 after your sin.

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 But I think a lot of times the reason why a lot of us go back

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 to our sin is because we don't talk about this fork in the road

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 right here that's called temptation.

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 We talk about what it looks like to come to God after we sin.

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 But what if there was something that we could be trained on

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 tonight that helps us how to say no to sin and to come to God

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 without having to go through all of that unnecessary pain.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Because here's the reality.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Because a lot of you tonight, your parents never learned about

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 temptation.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And because of that, they chose to indulge in sin and not to

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 abide with God and you're still experiencing the repercussions

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 and the consequences of their actions because they never

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 understood temptation.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 A lot of you have found yourself, I mean, me too, like,

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 as I'm studying this, guys, like, I'm getting new to this

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 whole sermon prep thing and like taking three verses and like

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 diving deep and as I'm like learning more about temptation,

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 I'm like, like, everyone's tempted.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 We're all tempted.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 I'm tempted all the time.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Like we're all sinning.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Everyone's a sinner.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 What's wrong with us?

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 We're all being deceived and I'm freaking out.

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And I'm like, wait, okay, that's not new.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I knew we were all sinners.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Like -- but I think a lot of us don't talk about temptation

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 enough.

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 We talk about the don'ts and the sins.

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 But what if we could get out ahead of it?

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And so tonight when you're tempted to gossip, when you're

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 going through that temptation to buy those shoes even though

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 you're in credit card debt.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Been there.

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 When you're tempted to have that one night stand or when you're

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 tempted to look at porn, when you're tempted to scroll on

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Instagram on that one girl's account and just let jealousy

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 fester in you.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 When you're tempted to Snapchat that picture that's just a

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 little bit too revealing to get a response.

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 When you're tempted to drink that drink.

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 When you know it's crossing the line and you're taking something

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 that was meant for good and you're turning it into evil.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 We're talking about that part of your life.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 The ability to understand temptation can help one's walk

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 with Christ significantly.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Listen, who you are right now, who I am right now and who I

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 want to be with the Lord.

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Who you want to be one day with the Lord which I hope is in a

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 thriving relationship with Him.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 In between that, who you're going to be one day, in between

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 that is a lot of temptation that can have major consequences on

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 your life.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And if you don't know how to fight it, you could suffer the

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 consequences in your 30s and your 40s and your 50s and you

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 think giving into it right now and feeding your sin a little

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 bit here and there in your 20s is kind of what your 20s are all

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 about and it is impacting your future and the future people

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 behind you and the people all around you.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 That's why James takes a moment tonight to talk about and inform

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 us how to fight temptation to the believer.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 He's going to do that.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Tonight we're going to talk to you about where temptation comes

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 from, what temptation leads to and how temptation is defeated.

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Point 1, where temptation comes from.

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Because that's the reality.

239
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Most of us, we don't know, every day there's kind of this thing

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 that we talk about when being a Christian that you have entered

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 into a war, light versus darkness.

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Angels versus demon.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 God versus Satan.

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 You are in the light now and there's a raging war around you.

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 We use that terminology about being in a spiritual war.

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But if you don't know where the arrows and the bullets are

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 coming from, you don't know who to fight.

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And you could be fighting the wrong person.

249
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And so James really clearly lays out where temptation comes from

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 starting in verse 13.

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 He says in verse 13, when tempted, so when you find

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 yourself at that fork, okay, when you find yourself at that

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 opportunity, let's say you're at the office and you know some

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 information about a girl and what she did last weekend and

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 some coworkers start talking about that girl and you're like

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 right now I could gossip about that girl and talk about her and

257
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 elevate myself by putting her down.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And you're like should these words come out of your mouth

259
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 because ooh, it will feel so sweet.

260
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Because she did that one thing that ticked me off last week and

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I'm like, I'm not going to do that right now.

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 And you find yourself at this opportunity, this temptation to

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 gossip.

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 When that moment comes, in moments like that, James would

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 say when tempted no one should say God is tempting me.

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 For God cannot be tempted by evil nor does he tempt anyone.

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's like I mentioned earlier.

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Last week we talked about how God allows testing through

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 trials in our life.

270
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And it can be really easy to get confused, testing and tempting.

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And so what James is making sure that you understand very

272
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 clearly is temptation comes from a few sources but one of them

273
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 is not God.

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Testing and tempting are not the same things.

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Why?

276
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Because temptation is an invitation to disobey God.

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And he wouldn't want that.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Temptation is an invitation to follow down a path that pulls

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 you further and further away from God.

280
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Last time I checked a good father does not want to be away

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 from his children.

282
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 He wants to be near them.

283
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And last time I checked God is perfect.

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 He's perfect in the midst of sin.

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And James is saying, hey, it seems obvious but it's quite

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 profound.

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Your God doesn't make mistakes.

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Because if he could make mistakes or if he could sin or if he

289
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 could be tempted by sin, that makes him an illegitimate God.

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 He's just like everyone else.

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 But he's perfect in every way.

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 That's what makes him a trustworthy father in every way.

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And so let me remind you that when you're tempted, do not say

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 that God is tempting me.

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Because number one, God cannot be tempted.

296
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 God cannot be in the presence of sin.

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Because it would taint his holiness.

298
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 God is perfect.

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 He cannot be in the presence of sin.

300
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Although he is radically in love with the sinner, he hates the

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 sin.

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And so then he goes on to say, because God does not tempt

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 anyone.

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 So not only can he not be tempted but nor does he tempt anyone

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 because he doesn't want anyone to participate in sin.

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Because if you're in sin, then you can't be with him because

307
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 he's holy.

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And so there's this moment where James is just saying, hey, God

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 does not want to like put sin in front of you and say, choose

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 this.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 That is not God.

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And so to think that God is the problem behind your temptation

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 is crazy because God wants to be with you.

314
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 God is a father who longs to be with his children.

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I think a lot of times this looks like -- I mean, people

316
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 are like, yeah, I'm blaming God all the time for temptation.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I know it's like from Satan or whatever.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But I think a lot of us more than we realize have blamed God

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 for what we think is our problem.

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Well, God, if you didn't give me these sexual urges, then I

321
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 wouldn't have like Snapchatted her at 2 a.m.

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And asked her to come watch a movie and happened to slip my

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 hand up her shirt and all these different things.

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 It's because you gave me these desires, God.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And I'm like, if I'm not doing this for my wife, my wifey for

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 lifey, then I could be doing sex the right way.

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And God, this is kind of your fault.

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And the point is, I'm tired of being single.

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 God, this is you.

330
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And that's what we do, we kind of blame God and make him the

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 object of our problem.

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 But James is saying here, hey, God is not the source of your

333
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 temptation.

334
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 God might test you.

335
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 God might bring trials into your life to allow you to be closer

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 to him.

337
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But God does not want you to sin.

338
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 He does not want you to partake in sin.

339
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And so if it's not God, who is it, James?

340
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And James would say in verse 14, but each person is tempted when

341
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 evil desire and enticed.

344
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I read that and I'm like, wait a second, you mean I'm tempting

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 you?

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 There is something in me, I go in the mirror and I'm like, what

347
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 is wrong with you, man.

348
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 I'm reading this and I'm like, man, it's your fault.

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And there is something, what does that mean?

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 That it's my own desires.

351
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 If that only results in harm, what is it in me that would lead

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 me to temptation?

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And it's what we talk about here called a sin nature.

354
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And yes, James parks in on the fact that it's you who wants to

355
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 sin and give in to those evil desires.

356
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And if you read the Bible in books like Ephesians 2 and

357
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Colossians and different places throughout the New Testament and

358
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 the Bible, there are often repeated three sources of

359
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 temptation.

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Write these down.

361
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Three sources of temptation.

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Because you want to know where the temptation is coming from.

363
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Here's where they are coming from.

364
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 One, Satan.

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 The prince of the air, the Bible would say in Ephesians 2.

366
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Satan.

367
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 The prince of the air, the Bible would say in Ephesians 2.

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Satan.

369
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 The second one, the world.

370
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 The system.

371
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Culture.

372
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Society.

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 We have chosen our sin time and time again.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Therefore taking the world and what God originally designed,

375
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 we have perverted it in such a way that now the world is

376
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 constantly sending you things to tempt you and take you -- it

377
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 says, hey, meet your own desires.

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Give yourself care.

379
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Do what you want when you want and don't let anyone else tell

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 you any different.

381
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 It's your truth and nothing but your truth.

382
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Do you boo.

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 That's what the world says.

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 But the problem with doing you is the third source of temptation.

385
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 You.

386
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 You.

387
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 You are the problem.

388
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 James says, you are dragged away and lured away and tempted by

389
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 your own evil desires.

390
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Who tempts you?

391
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Say you.

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Who tempts you?

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I guess you should say me.

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Who tempts me?

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Me.

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I'm like, I ain't tempting all y'all.

397
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And it's so true.

398
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Like I don't care if we're in church right now.

399
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Can we all be real?

400
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 There is a reason why we sin.

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 There's a reason why you and I sin.

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Because it's F-U-N, it's fun.

403
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 There's a reason why we think we're supposed to live it up in

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 our 20s.

405
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 There's a reason why we go and hook up time and time again with

406
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 people, different people occasionally on occasion every

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 other week.

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 There are reasons why we go out and get drunk and get high and

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 live for the high highs and low lows.

410
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Because there's something intoxicating about it.

411
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 There's something amazing about the way it makes you feel, the

412
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 endorphins that are released.

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 All the different things that go on in that, sin is fun.

414
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 But we know ultimately we're about to see here in the next

415
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 week, that sin ultimately does not end where it begins.

416
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 That's the problem.

417
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Yourself, Satan, and the world are giving you something fake.

418
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 They're making you believe that it's worth giving your life to,

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 but it only results in death.

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Which James would say in point two, what temptation leads to.

421
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Verse 14.

422
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their

423
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 own evil desire and enticed.

424
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to

425
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 sin.

426
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.

427
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I read this and I was like, oh, Lord, I'm about to have to give

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 the whole bees talk thing, the conception and birth and all of

429
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 that.

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Like everyone here knows what conception is, right?

431
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Well, don't assume anything.

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 When a mom and a dad love each other very much, they make you.

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And so A plus B equals C.

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 That's conception.

435
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 That's what you need to know.

436
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And James is using this illustration here and it's the

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 perfect illustration to give us an idea into what temptation is

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 and what it leads to.

439
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 What does temptation lead to?

440
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 It leads to sin.

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Which ultimately it says here when full grown leads to death.

442
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 So if A plus B equals sin, C, here's what that looks like.

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It is sin, you'll see.

444
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 You plus choosing evil desire equals sin.

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Okay?

446
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 So when you get to that fork in the road that I've been talking

447
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 about and you're sitting here, here's what this looks like.

448
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 What's an example?

449
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 When you're in bed and you've been feeling super lonely lately.

450
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Your phone is in your nightstand.

451
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 You've brushed your teeth.

452
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Floss, I hope.

453
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I don't floss.

454
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 You're laying in bed and right before you fall asleep you're

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 tired.

456
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Feeling a little more lonely than usual.

457
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 All of your friends went off with their significant others and

458
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 you're back at home.

459
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And all of a sudden you hear that noise.

460
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's the Snapchat notification because you have Snapchat on your

461
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 phone.

462
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 You need to delete Snapchat off your phone, it's nothing but

463
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 trouble.

464
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But you have Snapchat and it goes off and you look and it's that

465
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 name.

466
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 It's the name of the person that doesn't want commitment with you

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 but they want pleasure from you.

468
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And they want to first butter you up and convince you that you

469
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 should come over and watch a movie and cuddle.

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And you know it's always going to lead somewhere else and you're

471
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 like, you know, I hate the way I feel the next day.

472
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 But for now it could feel good for a moment.

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And the guilt and shame and the way I feel, how low I feel about

474
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 myself and the low self-esteem and the worth issues that are

475
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 soon to follow this night.

476
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 You know, for just a moment, this short moment to give in to

477
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 this would be worth it.

478
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 All those thoughts, that's called temptation.

479
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And you've got to get ahead of it.

480
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 You've got to start being proactive, not reactive.

481
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Because if you are not being proactive and you're being

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 reactive, if you're in a moment of weakness not ready to embrace

483
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 temptation because it's coming for every single one of us,

484
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

485
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

486
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

487
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

490
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

491
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

492
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

493
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

494
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

495
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

496
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

497
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

498
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

500
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

501
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Because you're going to lose the fight against temptation.

502
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And so when you get that Snapchat.

503
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 And you say, you know what, I'm worth more than that.

504
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Because I am a daughter or a son of the Father God.

505
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I don't need this.

506
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 You say thank you, but no thank you.

507
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And you call it a night and you go to bed.

508
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 You have fought temptation.

509
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But I'm afraid, I know myself.

510
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And I know for a lot of us here.

511
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 It's usually, that's not the end of the story.

512
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 You're out with your friends and you're like, I'm not going to drink tonight.

513
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And everyone is drinking.

514
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And you're like, okay, one ranch water I guess, low calorie, the diet thing.

515
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 You drink.

516
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 You drink another.

517
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 You start to feel something.

518
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And you're like, if I drink one more.

519
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 If I drink one more, I know that I'm crossing the line.

520
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And I know that on the other end of that line, on the other end of this temptation.

521
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I'm going to be led to sin.

522
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I'm going to be led to text that person or do that thing or mess up in some way.

523
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And it's going to take me further and further and further.

524
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And that is what produces sin.

525
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 But the temptation, the thought you have, is not the sin.

526
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 It's the result of the brokenness of the world and that you are broken.

527
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 So because you choose, because you and I choose to sin.

528
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Because in that moment we don't choose often God.

529
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Or we don't choose, you know, like fellas, I think a reoccurring one for us.

530
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And this is the reason why pornography, and ladies too.

531
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I got to stop saying that.

532
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Like ladies too.

533
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 I think one of the reasons why pornography is on just the way that it is in today's society.

534
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Is one, because it's just temptations everywhere.

535
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 In marketing, in commercials, on billboards.

536
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And we don't know how to fight that.

537
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 We don't know how to get in a fight.

538
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And like I said, we're reacting.

539
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Temptation hits us, billboard or person walking by or that.

540
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And we're reacting to it.

541
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And we don't get in front of it and we fall and we lead.

542
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And we're saying, I don't know how to fight it.

543
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 But you have to know that if you were to give in to that, where does it lead to?

544
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 What does it say in James?

545
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 That once you give birth to sin and you continue to feed it, it's going to lead to death.

546
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You have to see the end.

547
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Because that's what sin does.

548
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 It tempts you.

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Temptation convinces you that sin is going to be amazing for as long as you want it to.

550
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 But the reality is that sin rarely ever ends where it starts.

551
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Sin rarely ever ends where it begins.

552
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 What do I mean by that?

553
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Yeah, like I said, like in your 20s, you're single.

554
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 You can go live it up.

555
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 But like the reality is, is when you go and you go get wasted.

556
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Or when you go get high, it usually results in a lot of anxiety and stress or that hangover the next day.

557
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Like last time I checked, no one is just getting their hair held back and like, this is awesome.

558
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 You know, they're puking everywhere.

559
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 But like you know it's coming.

560
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Because sin, when given birth, it leads to so much consequence.

561
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Or wondering, man, all this hooking up.

562
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Like statistics are crazy about STDs.

563
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And none of us are talking about it.

564
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Like, what are we doing?

565
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And we're being deceived.

566
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Like, man, yeah, this is awesome.

567
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Hookup culture is awesome.

568
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And yet everyone had to go get tests constantly wondering, do I have an STD?

569
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Like on the other end of that, it's no good.

570
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 It doesn't end where it began.

571
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 What started so fun and carefree and passionate ended in just like embarrassment and guilt and shame.

572
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 The pornography.

573
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 It's just me.

574
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It's not affecting anyone else.

575
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 It's just me saying I'm a single.

576
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It will change when I get in a relationship.

577
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And then when you get in that relationship, you start comparing them because you're used to being addicted to a variety that you see on the screen.

578
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 And then that person isn't entertaining you in the way that those women did on that screen or those men did on that screen.

579
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And now it's just leading to more and more death.

580
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And it didn't end how it began.

581
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 So James is saying here, hey, wake up.

582
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Sin is robbing you.

583
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Temptation is lying to you.

584
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And the more you feed it, like over here, if I go over here and I just -- if I were to like right now grab one cookie and eat it, it's like, sure.

585
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Diet's not ruined.

586
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Not the end of the world.

587
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 There's always tomorrow.

588
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 But like more than likely I'm like, well, today is already a new day.

589
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Tomorrow is a new day.

590
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Let's send it.

591
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Let's eat a few.

592
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And then like I eat a few cookies and then I'm like people want to go eat, I don't know, like salada or something.

593
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And I'm like, no, thanks.

594
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And I'm like looking in the mirror and I'm just miserable.

595
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And what just started off as one cookie, like eating more and more and more, I feel sick.

596
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And in the same way, like what started off as just one small thing, you kept feeding it, like James says, more and more and more and it grew bigger and bigger and bigger and it got more and more of an appetite.

597
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And now it's devouring you.

598
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And you're addicted.

599
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 You're ashamed.

600
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 You don't know what it's like to be free.

601
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 That's never what should mark the life of a Christian in a relationship with the Lord.

602
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 He wants freedom for you.

603
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 He wants good things for you.

604
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Which is why James ends the way he does with temptation.

605
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 How temptation is defeated.

606
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 1 16.

607
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Don't be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters.

608
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows, who he chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of all he created.

609
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 So I'm about to just walk us through as I wrap up three steps.

610
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Three steps on how temptation is defeated.

611
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And I'm just going to take it through sentence by sentence of what James says here.

612
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And what he says is, hey, remember what's true.

613
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 When faced with temptation, when faced with that opportunity to choose God or to choose sin, remember what's true.

614
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Wake up.

615
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 You're being poured lies by Satan or by the world, what culture is saying, what your self is saying.

616
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Your heart, the Bible says, is wicked and deceitful above all else.

617
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Don't listen to yourself.

618
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 You're going to choose you every single time.

619
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And that only ends, like he said earlier, in death.

620
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And so don't be deceived.

621
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And so in the moment of temptation, how you can defeat it is to remember what's true.

622
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He says in 16, don't be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters.

623
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 So how?

624
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 One, know who you're fighting.

625
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Point one.

626
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Know where the source of temptation is coming from.

627
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And then two, understand that your temptation is lying to you.

628
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Everything we've covered.

629
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 That's how you remain in remembering truth, constantly being reminded, speaking it out.

630
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 I remember the time in my life where I started actually bringing accountability into my life.

631
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And by accountability, I just mean brothers and sisters who are willing to call you out and call you higher as you pursue the Lord.

632
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Accountability changed everything in my life.

633
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 If I'm struggling with lust, I can say, hey, guys, I'm struggling with lust.

634
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 I'm struggling with wondering thoughts.

635
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 I want to give in.

636
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 I want to cross boundaries.

637
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I want to do these things.

638
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Will you hold me accountable?

639
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Because no soldier goes into the war zone alone.

640
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 You need other brothers and sisters to remind you of truth, that when you're being deceived, they can say, hey, wake up.

641
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 You're being lied to.

642
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 There's no life there.

643
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 It's leading you to death.

644
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Wake up.

645
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Because sometimes we can't see it ourself.

646
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And so practically remember the truth and let people remind you, be around people who will constantly remind you of truth.

647
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Never forget the power of confessing.

648
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Like the truth behind confession, that we confess our sins to one another.

649
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 We pray for one another so that we will experience healing.

650
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 The reason why we confess is not just to be better sinners or to like, man, glorify our sin.

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 We confess so that people can remind us of what's true.

652
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Because your temptation is constantly deceiving us.

653
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 First Corinthians 10.13 says, no temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind.

654
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And God is faithful.

655
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.

656
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.

657
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 This fired me up when I read this text and I was thinking about temptation.

658
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Temptation at times can feel so heavy.

659
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 When you're driving home and you're like, I know exactly what's waiting for me.

660
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 That computer is waiting for me when I get home and I'm alone.

661
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Or I know when I get to the house with me and my girlfriend or significant other or that person, I know what's coming.

662
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And I know tonight when I go out, I'm going to drink and drink or I'm going to hit this or do that.

663
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Whatever it might be.

664
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Temptation can feel so heavy and it's like there's no way I'm breaking free from this.

665
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 I'm sending it tonight.

666
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I'm doing this.

667
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 If you are a son or daughter of God, we have been given a way out according to this verse.

668
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 This is a powerful verse.

669
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 The key to being proactive and not be deceived is to constantly remind yourself of this verse.

670
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 That God is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.

671
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 When Satan and the world and yourself are convincing you that you have to give in.

672
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 That this is the only way to fix your loneliness.

673
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 That this is the only way to bring you satisfaction.

674
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 That this is better than God.

675
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 That this is better than God.

676
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 When it's screaming that at you, you can shout this verse back at it.

677
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Because if God is allowing you to be tempted, it's because he's already predetermined that you can withstand that temptation.

678
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 That's what this verse is telling me.

679
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 If God is allowing us to be tempted, it's because he knows he can withstand it.

680
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 He can choose me.

681
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Because I will give him the strength.

682
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 That's what that says.

683
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 That you can not withstand that God allows in your life.

684
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 That's powerful.

685
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 So the next time that you feel like all you have to do is cave in, remember, man, if this is in front of me, if God is tempting me with this, there is power in being a son and daughter of God.

686
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And I can resist.

687
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 And I can choose him.

688
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Which leads me to step two.

689
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 You choose him because you remember who your father is.

690
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 You choose him because you don't forget who he has been and who he is in your life.

691
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 We can't forget, you guys.

692
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 We can't forget who God really is.

693
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 In verse 17 it says, every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the father of the heavenly lights.

694
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Who does not change like shifting shadows?

695
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 We have to have the right view of who God is.

696
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 A God that's a father.

697
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 A God that's a father.

698
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And I'm going to tell you, guys, this is a big deal for so many of us.

699
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 So many of us want to run to ourselves or run to the world or run to any solution other than God because we do not remember who God actually is.

700
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 You've let culture dictate who God is.

701
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 You've let media dictate who God is.

702
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 You've let circumstances or your upbringing or that church that you hated or did that really wrong thing to you or that person dictate who God is.

703
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 You've let God dictate who God is.

704
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 God is a dictator.

705
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 God is a cosmic kill joy.

706
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 He doesn't want me to have vacation or fun.

707
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 He wants me to do all of these rules and yes and no's.

708
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 That's not who God is.

709
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 That's not my God.

710
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 That's not the God in the Bible.

711
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 That's not who God is saying or who James is saying God is here.

712
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 James is saying on the contrary, every good thing you have, whether you follow God or not, he's the creator of everything you have.

713
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It's not from you.

714
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And if you think it's from you, you are being deceived.

715
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Every good and perfect gift has come from above.

716
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 But there is a father of lies.

717
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 A father of lies and his name is Satan and he wants to convince you that he has something better for you than the father of lights.

718
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 That's what James is referring to as the father of lights.

719
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 The God that illuminates and allows you to see clearly in the midst of all the temptation creates.

720
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 You can see that God is not trying to rob from you.

721
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 He's not trying to rip you off.

722
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 He's trying to set you free.

723
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 You think that following temptation and going to sin is going to give you freedom.

724
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Yeah, night on the town.

725
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Yeah, I can drink when I want.

726
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 The men I want do what I want when I want.

727
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And you are enslaved.

728
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 You're a slave to sin.

729
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 And it's deceiving you to believe that you're free, but you're bound.

730
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Only in the Lord can one be free.

731
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 But your sin is going to do everything to convince you that that's not true.

732
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 It's going to do everything it can to distort and allow you to forget who God is.

733
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 And so in the face of the temptation, the way you defeat it is to remember that he's a good father who loves to give every good and perfect gift to his children, which is step three.

734
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Remember what your father's done.

735
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 How do you defeat temptation?

736
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Remember what your father's done.

737
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Verse 18, he chose to give us birth through the word of truth that we might be a kind of first fruits of all he created.

738
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 It's really cool here, James uses another birthing analogy.

739
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 But this time it's not us plus a choice or temptation or a desire that gives birth to sin.

740
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 This time, because us plus sin is going to continually keep us separated from God, God knew that.

741
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 So he gave us ultimately the perfect gift through his son.

742
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 When James says here the word of truth, he's talking about Jesus, his brother.

743
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And so he's really saying right here, look at what God has done.

744
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 He chose, despite when you get to that fork in the road and you choose sin over him and he saw what you would do, that while you were a sinner, he chose to allow you an opportunity to be reborn,

745
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 to die to your old self that craves sin and wants to be Lord of your own life and to be reborn in Jesus.

746
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 God gave us the word of truth, also known as Jesus, so that we can be reborn, that we can be new,

747
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 so that we can have the strength through Jesus to defeat and conquer temptation because he conquered sin once and for all on the cross.

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Jesus.

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Looking to Jesus.

750
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Remembering what the Father has done for you in giving his one and only son is how you withstand temptation.

751
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Remembering that at one point that all had sinned.

752
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Today, every one of us come in here with sins that create a separation between us and God.

753
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 And God did not want that separation.

754
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 He did not want that distance.

755
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 He didn't want to keep things from you.

756
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 He wanted a thriving relationship with his children.

757
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 And so in order to make that a way, he sent his one and only child.

758
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 So we could be children of God.

759
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 And that child named Jesus came down to earth.

760
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 And instead of giving in to temptation, he was literally tempted.

761
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 There's a part in the Bible where Jesus is literally tempted by Satan himself, like right there in front of him,

762
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 in the midst of a wilderness, a desert, for 40 days had not eaten.

763
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Satan is holding out a platter of bread and is trying to get Jesus to eat it and is tempting him and tempting him.

764
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 And Jesus does not fall.

765
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Jesus remained perfect through it all, making him the perfect sacrifice in a way that you and I never could.

766
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And so he took himself, and he who knew no sin became sin on the cross.

767
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 And he died our death that we deserved for all the times that when we came to the fork in the road and chose our sin over God,

768
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 he hung there on that cross and he became sin.

769
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Why?

770
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Because God knew that when the temptation would come, yeah, we would want to choose God,

771
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 but at times because we are broken people, we were going to choose our sin.

772
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 So he came and made his son sin on our behalf.

773
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And he died.

774
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 He died the death that was in our place.

775
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 And then they buried him.

776
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 And three days later, he defeated death.

777
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 He conquered sin.

778
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 He rose from the grave.

779
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 We are about to celebrate one of the greatest days in history when Jesus rose from the grave,

780
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 declaring victory over sin and death once and for all this weekend.

781
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 I hope you come and join us.

782
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 If you don't have a church home, come join us.

783
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday, as we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus and what it meant for you and I on behalf of our sin.

784
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 That in the midst of temptation, when it seems that there's nothing that we can do to defeat it,

785
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 we have Jesus to look to.

786
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 It is crazy to think that God chose, James says, he chose to give us birth,

787
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 to give us the opportunity to be reborn through his son's death and burial and resurrection on our behalf.

788
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 And that we may have life.

789
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 God wants to use young adults to change the world.

790
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 God wants to use young adults like you and I to declare to the world of his goodness and to bring glory to him.

791
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 But the reality is, is temptation will be in the way trying to get you to stop that from happening.

792
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 And Satan is on a mission to do everything he can to stop you from seeing the potential that God wants to use you for,

793
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 to bring his name glory and to use your life in ways that you could never imagine.

794
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 And so get ready to fight.

795
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And look to Jesus.

796
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Because Jesus chose you, because Jesus chose you and died on the cross,

797
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 you now, when faced with the decision to choose your sin or to choose God,

798
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 have the power to choose God, to say no to sin and yes to God.

799
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 And when you don't, you have Jesus.

800
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Jesus who said, "I'll take it for him."

801
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 So when you're faced to follow temptation, choose Jesus, because he chose you.

802
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Let's pray.

803
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Father, thank you that in the midst of our sin and our suffering,

804
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 you made a way through Jesus that you did not leave us alone.

805
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 That you did not leave us here to fight on our own.

806
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 That you made a way through Jesus that despite our victory, our failures,

807
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 we can look to Jesus who took our sin and who will take those times that we,

808
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 even tonight, when we're faced with temptation and we come at the crossroads

809
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 to choose you or to choose sin and we choose sin,

810
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 may tonight we not use that to run further from you.

811
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 May we run to you because of Jesus, because he ran to us,

812
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 because he ran down to earth for us.

813
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 And God, because of that, may we not choose you instead of sin out of some obligation,

814
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 because out of an awe that you would love us that much.

815
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Because Jesus chose sin on our behalf, may we choose him instead of our sin.

816
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 In that we pray, amen.

817
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Let's respond in worship.

818
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,360
