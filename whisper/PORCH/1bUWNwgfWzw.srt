1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 I mean, he's practically dating a model.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,500
 She told me they went to Cabo, and he paid for the whole thing.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
 Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 He proposed at the Eiffel Tower. In Paris.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league, and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,500
 She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 What more could you ask for?

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
 What more could you ask for? How we doing, The Porch?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Thank you for being here. Dallas, Fort Worth, we're so excited you guys are watching.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Downtown Dallas, thank you guys for hanging out with us there this summer.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We'll see you here next week. Houston, Texas, we're so glad you guys are gathered there as well.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 We are excited about this series and what God is doing through the lives of young adults.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 He's changing the world through the lives of young adults.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 That's why we do this. We are just pumped.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We're continuing our series, Relationship Goals.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I'll start with a story. Twelve years ago, September 20th will be marked 12 years.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I and my lovely wife, Monica, were headed to our honeymoon.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We had just got married.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 The day after our wedding, we are in DFW Airport,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 about to go to the Riviera Maya in Mexico Beach,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 all-inclusive resort for a week.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 We're so pumped about it. We are so excited.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We go to the airport. We get there early.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 We park at remote north parking because that's what you do when you're a good steward.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 We had four bags just like this.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I remember we had these four bags.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I'm trying to be chivalrous. I'm trying to be a gentleman, a good husband now that I'm 24 hours in.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I'm like, "Hey, you take this one, baby. I'll get these three."

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I'm loading them up on the bus one by one.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 We take the bus to the terminal.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 There, where the bus dropped us off, to get to the gate to check in, you had to go up this escalator.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 DFW has the biggest escalators.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 It drops us off at this escalator. We got these four bags.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 This is not where I dog on her for bringing a bunch of bags because in reality, I'm the shopper in our family.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 She had two bags. I had two bags.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 We were created equal and equally yoked, if you will.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 There we are. I'm like, "All right, sweetie. You got your bag. I got these three."

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I get them on the escalator. It's complicated because those stairs move.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I got one on and then the other. I'm holding them.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'm doing this act. She's right here just below me.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I got her bag and I got these three.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 When we get to the top of the escalator, the sides of the escalator don't move.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 The sides are not moving. The side kind of grabs one of the bags and it lurches me forward.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I bump her and then she begins to fall down the stairs.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I grab onto her and when I do, I begin to fall on top of her.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Three bags falling on top of me. I'm not lying.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 We fall from the top of the escalator to the bottom of the escalator.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I'm laying there on my back. She's on top of me. Bags on top of her.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I'm bleeding.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'm like, "This is how it starts?"

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Like, "Is this a bad omen or something? This cannot be good."

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Like, "I'm hurt. My leg is bleeding."

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 The moral to the story is don't go on your honeymoon with a bunch of baggage.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It happened. It's true.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I believe the Lord gave me that so 12 years later I can say that line.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Do not go on your honeymoon with a bunch of baggage.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That's what we're going to talk about tonight as we move through this series.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 We're not on the date yet. I'm well aware of that.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 We've been talking about the prerequisites to dating.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 First, that you date for marriage.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 To date for marriage you have to have an understanding, a biblical worldview of what marriage is.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Then we talked about this idea that we love people.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 To love people we have to go back to the author of love, the one who invented love,

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 the one who claims that he is love, to understand how to love.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Next week we'll move towards the date.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 We'll move towards looking for the one that we're going to spend the rest of our life with.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 But this week we have to deal with our baggage.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I don't know if anybody in the room, if there's 3,600 people here,

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 there's 3,600 people with baggage here.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You have baggage. You have to know what it is.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 How amazing this evening if we can identify our baggage and you,

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 so you don't have to be like me, you don't have to take it on your honeymoon.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 You don't have to take your baggage into marriage.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Could you imagine how powerful that would be?

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I hope tonight is not a burden for you. I hope that it presents to you hope.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 At some point in this message you may feel guilty, you may feel weight,

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 you may feel condemnation or conviction.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I just want you to hang in there with me.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Hang in there because there's good news this evening from the Scriptures

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 as we dive into the Scriptures.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 What more loving thing could you do for your future spouse

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 than to begin tonight to intentionally deal with the baggage from your past?

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 The baggage that you carry around with you today, whether you realize it or not.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Some of you will realize that you have baggage that you're carrying with you.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 That means that you shouldn't be dating right now.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 That you need to take a season.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Some of you will realize that you need to end a relationship tonight.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Okay, don't leave. Take a deep breath.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 No need to elbow anybody. Just hang in there.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Let's look at the Scriptures for hope because here's what I can promise you.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 If you do things according to God's plan, he'll bless that.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 You trusting yourself over God's plan will never, ever, not one single time,

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 not ever go well for you.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And so let's just see what he has to say from these ancient texts this evening.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And I do hope that you leave with hope.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 As we move through this text here in Colossians chapter 3,

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 we're going to look at unchecked sins, unchecked hurts,

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 and before you leave here this evening, unchecked lies that you are believing.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Now it's not often that I always kind of will read the Scriptures and learn things.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 So I'll learn things, but it's not often that I'll see something that will just kind of blow my mind.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Like, "Wow, I never realized that before. That happened to me this week."

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 That happened to me this week, and so I want to share that with you,

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 what I learned from the Scriptures this week because I never noticed something.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 In Ephesians chapter 5, Colossians 3, and 1 Corinthians 6,

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 the Apostle Paul, who wrote these letters to the churches there in Colossae and Ephesus and Corinth,

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 he wrote these letters. That's what these Scriptures are,

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 these ancient texts that the Holy Spirit preserved for us.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 They're just, at least in the New Testament, the epistles, those are letters to literal churches.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And so he doesn't know that he's writing Scriptures.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 He's just writing letters. He's saying, "Hey, this is how you should conduct the church.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Hey, these are things that you need to be aware of.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Hey, this is what it means to live a godly life, a holy life, to pursue Christ.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 This is what Christ has done for you."

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So he's just writing these letters that now we read and we apply to our lives.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 But what was interesting to me about these letters to the church in Ephesus, Colossae, and Corinth

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 is that he talks about marriage in all three of them.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 He talks about the role of a husband and the role of a wife in all three of them.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And in all three of those letters, right before he talks about marriage,

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 he gives a list of sins and he says, "That's what you were. That's not who you are.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 You need to put these to death. You need to put them aside.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 You need to take them off and put on the clothes of Christ to realize who you were."

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 See, some of you came in here this evening and you have an identity problem.

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 You have to go back to the basics of the gospel and realize who you are in Jesus Christ.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And so I'm going to tell you where the other two places are.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I don't have time to cover right now. That's your homework.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I want you to look this up. Write these down.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 So in Ephesians chapter 5, this is where husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Right before that, in verses 3 through 8, he gives us this list of sins.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 In 1 Corinthians 6, which is right before 1 Corinthians 7,

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 where he talks about the role of a husband, the role of a wife, the Christian household.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 In 1 Corinthians 6, verses 9 through 11, he gives us a very similar list of sin, lots of overlap.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And then again, where we'll be tonight in Colossians chapter 3.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And so this blew my mind this week and I'm glad I can share that with you.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I want you to go home and study it for yourselves.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 But we'll be in Colossians 3, verses 5 through 10 this evening.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Very similar list. He says this.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You, porch, you used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived, your old life, your past life,

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 your BC life, your before Christ life.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 But now, you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these, anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices,

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator."

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 He says, "Hey, porch, that's who you were. You're not that anymore.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Stop continuing in those ways. Christ has made you new.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 He's given you some new clothes to wear.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 You don't have to wear those old grave clothes.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 You don't have to carry around that old baggage.

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 That's not who you are.

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 You're a new creation, with the Holy Spirit living inside of you, purchased with a price.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Walk in that way. Check that baggage."

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And so, my first point this evening is, sin left unchecked leads to addictions.

153
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I've realized that as I've met with young adults, there are three categories of baggage that I want to pull from this scripture,

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 that I think are the three biggest categories of baggage for everyone here.

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And the first one is addiction.

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 This comes from your pet sins.

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 This is the bag that you carry around with you.

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 These are those little pet sins that you have in your life.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And so, if we open this bag, what's inside? These are the clothes you can't get rid of.

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 You know that old comfy sweatshirt that you like to wear when you're watching movies?

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 You know, these are the clothes that you just, maybe it's something that has, you know, some...

162
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It's okay. It's okay.

163
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Like, I don't know if butterfly collars and pearl snaps are still in, but...

164
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It's true religion. I paid way too much for this shirt, and so I'm going to keep it, okay?

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 That's not going to goodwill.

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And I don't know when the engineer pants are coming back in style, but these always fit just perfect.

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And I just can't... And who else wears 36 inseam? I mean, I can't get rid of them.

168
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 But you guys know these sins. You know these ones that you can't...

169
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I mean, some of these things are very familiar to you.

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And you know the addiction that they've caused in your life.

171
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 You know the things that rule you.

172
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Talked about that comfy sweatshirt you can't get rid of.

173
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And you're carrying them around with you.

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And it desires to end your marriage long before your marriage ever started.

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Desires to hurt your spouse before you ever even meet them.

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 These sins. These sins that are left unchecked that grow into something that controls you.

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry."

178
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 These things are addiction.

179
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And so I want to talk about the first few on the list, because these are the ones he repeats over and over.

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 He talks about sexual immorality and impurity and lust.

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 These are the ones that I've noticed as I've met with you tend to be some of the biggest baggage that folks here carry.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 They come from your addiction to pornography, your past sex life, your encounters, be it one time at prom or be it right before you came here.

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Maybe it's like, "Well, we're married in God's eyes," or "We're going to," or "It's a committed relationship."

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 "I think it's okay." Read your Bible.

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Understand God's Word.

186
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 You're behind a lie.

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I don't know if you've ever noticed that we create categories for sex.

188
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 We create different categories for it.

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 The other day I was talking to a young man.

190
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 He told me he was struggling with pornography.

191
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 By struggling, I mean he was falling into it.

192
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 There was no struggle.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 The struggle was him falling victim to pornography and giving himself to it on a weekly, regular basis.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 He said, "Yeah, I look at porn every week, but at least I'm still a virgin."

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I want you to hear what I said to him.

196
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I said, "Why do you think Jesus is a liar?"

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He said, "I don't think Jesus is a liar."

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I said, "Well, why would you call yourself a virgin?"

199
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I read in the Scripture, Matthew 5, verse 28 says,

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 "I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her."

201
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Jesus said you're not a virgin.

202
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Now listen closely.

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I don't say that to condemn you, or to hurt you, or to put condemnation on you.

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 You've got to remember, Jesus, the one who said those words, is the one who paid for that sin to make you a new creation.

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 But why do we put these categories around sex as if one is better than another,

206
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 and I'll live with this one as long as it's not that one?

207
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I think we have to redefine what this even means.

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I believe the reason Jesus is saying this is because he knows how dangerous and detrimental to a healthy marriage that activity is.

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 If we've hung out long at all, you know that derailed my marriage two years in.

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And not that I was actively looking at porn two years into marriage,

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 but I was actively looking at porn the 12 years before marriage.

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And it almost cost me my marriage.

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I'm so passionate about this.

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 This is why Jesus says, "Do everything you can to get rid of it."

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away.

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off, people.

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Get rid of it.

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Get rid of the computer.

219
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Who needs it?

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 What are we doing?

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Do whatever it takes to deal with these sins that seek to kill you.

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And so I'm talking about any kind of sex outside of marriage.

223
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Oral sex, anal sex, sexting, gay sex, straight sex.

224
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Any kind of sex.

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 As you pursue sexual pleasure outside of marriage, just to clear the categories.

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 God is saying, "Hey, you're hurting yourself."

227
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And I have something better for you.

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I'm not just trying to give you rules to follow to make you feel guilty.

229
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I'm trying to set you free and give you life so that you can have it abundantly, he says.

230
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 There's this misunderstanding around this word, "sex."

231
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Sex is nowhere in the Bible.

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 It's not mentioned in the scripture.

233
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 We have different words.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Sex is an English word that we use to describe this activity.

235
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 But in fact, I have a friend that says, "I don't even talk about sex inside of marriage."

236
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Because people have such a skewed view.

237
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Young adults going into marriage have such a skewed view of what it is.

238
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 He actually speaks to premarriage often.

239
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And he says, "You know what? I hope you never have sex."

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 These are couples that are just about to get married.

241
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 He says, "I hope you never have sex," which he gets all their attention.

242
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And he says, "I hope that you pursue intimacy and oneness in marriage."

243
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 He says, "Sex is something dogs do on the side of the street."

244
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I hope that you pursue intimacy and oneness with one another.

245
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 We don't know that.

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Some of you will never have that.

247
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And I'm not saying that you will never have sex.

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 You may only just have sex.

249
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And God has something better for you.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 You're learning the wrong way.

251
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 You're training your heart and your mind for something distantly second, third, fourth, best.

252
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 When God has something much better for you.

253
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 The Hebrew word that we translate sex is literally mingling of souls.

254
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 What a beautiful reality.

255
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And so I've talked about that one.

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 He says, "Sexual immorality, impurity."

257
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But listen, addictions that you need to check can be anything.

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 If you're addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, anorexia, bulimia, eating disorders, an addiction to food.

259
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 It could be an addiction to working out.

260
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 It could be an addiction to things.

261
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Maybe you love to shop.

262
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You wake up in the morning.

263
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 You go to Woot.com.

264
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 You go to Amazon.

265
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 You can't wait to buy something.

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Maybe it's masturbation for you.

267
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Maybe it's gambling.

268
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You love to go to Shreveport or Vegas or play Hold 'Em or whatever that is for you.

269
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Maybe it's an addiction to people, relationships.

270
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 You're codependent.

271
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You look back and you realize you've never been single since the fifth grade.

272
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 You've got a problem.

273
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 You've got to deal with it.

274
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Paul says, "Greed, materialism."

275
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 In 1 Corinthians 6, he goes on to say, "I will not be mastered by anything."

276
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 You have an addiction.

277
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 If you can't go, say, three months without something, that's an addiction.

278
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 See, I don't think we ever think we have an addiction.

279
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 There's so many of you that have been looking at pornography at least every month since the fifth grade.

280
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 You wouldn't say, "Well, I'm addicted."

281
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You wouldn't even say that word.

282
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Can I tell you something?

283
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 As a friend who loves you, you're addicted.

284
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 You're an addict.

285
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 You need help.

286
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And help's available.

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 That's the good news.

288
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I've found healing.

289
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I was an addict.

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I've been healed.

291
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I've been set free.

292
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 I walk in freedom, and you can too.

293
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Often, these addictions in our lives, they lead to deep hurts.

294
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And these deep hurts turn to us lashing out in anger.

295
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And that's what Paul writes in verse 7.

296
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 "You used to walk in these ways, friends."

297
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That's who you were.

298
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 That's the life you once lived.

299
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 That's who you were.

300
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 It's not who you are.

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 "But now you must also," verse 8, "you must also rid yourself of all such things as these."

302
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Anger, rage, malice, slander, filthy language from your lips, cursing.

303
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 My second point this evening is that hurts left unchecked lead to anger.

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Hurts left unchecked lead to anger.

305
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 This is that bag that we don't want to show anyone.

306
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 This bag.

307
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 This is that one that we don't want anybody to see what's in it.

308
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 We don't want to deal with that thing that happened.

309
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 We don't want to face it.

310
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 It's hard to open.

311
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 It's heavy.

312
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 It's got weights in it, rocks in it, been carrying around.

313
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 These are things that happened to you.

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 These are clothes that have been given to you.

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I wouldn't buy that.

316
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Somebody gave that to me.

317
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And they're heavy and they're thick.

318
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Someone passed it on to you.

319
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Someone did that to you.

320
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And now you've got this weight and you're carrying it around.

321
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 You don't want anyone to see it.

322
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 It's hard to hide.

323
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It shows up in traffic.

324
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 It shows up when things don't go your way, when you don't get the promotion.

325
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 It shows up when you realize the state that you're in.

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 When you feel like God's ripping you off, this shows up.

327
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And you are just waiting for someone to come along so that they can make you feel better.

328
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And you're going to sink them.

329
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You're going to latch on to them.

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And you're going to weigh them down with your anger and your malice and your rage and your cursing and your broken heart.

331
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 These hurts, they can be anything.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 They can come from anywhere.

333
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 It comes from past relationships, a breakup.

334
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Someone stole your heart.

335
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Why'd they do that to you?

336
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Ended up cheating on you.

337
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Betrayal.

338
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Caused hurts.

339
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 An abortion.

340
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Partnered with that.

341
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Tried to hide something.

342
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Tried to fix it.

343
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 That can cause this.

344
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 There's healing, friends.

345
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 You don't have to carry that weight around.

346
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 We're not mad at you.

347
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 We're not mad at you.

348
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 We love you.

349
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 God loves you.

350
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 He's not mad at you.

351
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 He just wants to talk about it.

352
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Can we just talk about it?

353
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 You're going to hide that your whole life?

354
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 You're going to take that to the grave?

355
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 No, you're not.

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 You're going to die from the inside out, slowly carrying around that weight.

357
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 It can be from parents.

358
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 A parent that left.

359
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 You don't understand why a divorce that you experienced,

360
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 that still hurts when you think about it,

361
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 caused a damage that you never wanted to admit,

362
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 or maybe you do admit it,

363
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 or maybe your parents did this weird thing.

364
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 It was a performance-based acceptance.

365
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 They said, "Hey, I love you as long as you're good,

366
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 "as long as you get the ribbon,

367
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 "as long as you get the trophy,

368
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 "as long as you make the team,

369
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 "as long as you perform,

370
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 "as long as you look my friends in their eyes.

371
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 "Yes, sir.

372
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 "No, sir.

373
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 "Yes, ma'am.

374
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 "No, ma'am."

375
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 As long as you do these things,

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 you're going to feel love from me,

377
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 but if you don't do these things,

378
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 you're going to feel like I regret you.

379
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Gosh.

380
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 That's heavy.

381
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 That's a heavy, heavy weight.

382
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 It can come from abuse, friends.

383
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Any kind of abuse.

384
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It can be physical abuse.

385
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Someone taking their anger out on you.

386
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You swear you'll never be like that,

387
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 but the stuff is passed on like a disease,

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 one person to the next.

389
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 People who say they'll never be that way,

390
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 it just goes, just perpetuates itself.

391
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Example, such a strong force.

392
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 It can be mental abuse.

393
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Maybe you dated someone that played mind games with you.

394
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 They said they loved you,

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 but they consistently hurt you,

396
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 and this causes this.

397
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 It can be the unspeakable sexual abuse

398
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 that you swear you'd never deal with.

399
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 I know that's heavy.

400
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 I know it's heavy.

401
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I've sat with you.

402
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I've talked with you in my office.

403
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I know it's heavy,

404
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 but we've got to deal with it tonight.

405
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 We've got to stop carrying it around.

406
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 We've got to find healing from this.

407
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 The truth is, friends,

408
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 the truth is most of us here tonight

409
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 have experienced sexual abuse.

410
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 That's the reality.

411
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 You probably, in ways that you're naive to,

412
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 have experienced sexual abuse.

413
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Let me redefine the term for you.

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Sex or intimacy between two people

415
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 was God's invention,

416
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 a genius invention, I might add,

417
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 for marriage.

418
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 If you've had sex outside the context of marriage of any kind,

419
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 you've abused it.

420
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You've gone against the Creator's design,

421
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and you have been a part of a force

422
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 that is so much stronger and more powerful

423
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 than you could ever imagine.

424
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 The world tries to convince you that it's no big deal,

425
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 and that is why the world is suffering as it is today.

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Why divorce rates climb while marriage has declined.

427
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Kids born out of wedlock.

428
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 The hurts that we see today,

429
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 because they keep telling you, "No big deal."

430
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 We've experienced sexual abuse,

431
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and we've never experienced healing from that.

432
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 But let me tell you something.

433
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 There's hope, because

434
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 if you have been a victim of any kind of abuse,

435
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 and you appropriately heal from it,

436
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 you expose it, you bring it into the light,

437
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 God begins to repair your heart.

438
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 You are given one of the most powerful forces in the world.

439
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It's called empathy.

440
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Hurt people who carry around weight,

441
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 hurt people, hurt people, hurt people.

442
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 But healed people have the power of the Holy Spirit in them

443
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 when they've been healed through the blood of Christ Jesus,

444
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 through confession, repentance,

445
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 dealing with their sins, their struggles, their hurts.

446
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And they go through recovery,

447
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 and healed people heal people.

448
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And you have that opportunity to go through that.

449
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I've seen this, man.

450
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 I have a friend who had been divorced,

451
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 gone through all kinds of crazy relationships,

452
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 found identity in men,

453
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 got pregnant, had an abortion,

454
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 carried that weight.

455
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And went through a recovery program

456
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 for those who had an abortion.

457
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And you know what she had to do?

458
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 She had to carry these rocks with her everywhere she went

459
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 until she was ready to receive the grace of Christ.

460
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And I was with her.

461
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 We were in the Amazon jungle, true story,

462
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 on a boat, on an international discipleship trip to the Amazon.

463
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And she took those rocks to the top of that boat,

464
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and she threw them in the Amazon River

465
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 and said, "I am ready to receive the grace of Christ.

466
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 "I am ready to extend forgiveness to those who have hurt me.

467
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 "I am ready to understand that God has forgiven me

468
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 "for the hurts that I've done."

469
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And she got baptized in the very same water that she threw the rocks in.

470
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And that's not all.

471
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Do you know what happened next?

472
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 The Lord began to heal her,

473
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and He created a ministry

474
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 to those who've had abortions around her.

475
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And that ministry grew,

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 and today it's thousands of people,

477
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 many of whom are listening to me right now.

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 That's what God does

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 when you bring your hurts to Him.

480
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Some of you, the hurt that you carry around

481
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 is that you look at where you're at,

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 and you're like, "Hey, I don't even marriage.

483
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 "I don't even have any prospects, and I want to get married to God.

484
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 "Why have you forgotten me?"

485
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And you're sitting there, and you're drowning in the sea of singleness.

486
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 You're drowning in the waters of singleness,

487
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 and you're like, "God, why don't you throw me a life raft of marriage?

488
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 "Throw me the life raft of marriage."

489
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And He's like,

490
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 "'Cause you'll drown."

491
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 If I did, you'd sink.

492
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 It's too heavy for you right now.

493
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 You need to heal with the bitterness inside of you,

494
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 and stop wearing these weights.

495
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Stop wearing these weights,

496
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 but check the baggage.

497
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Check it.

498
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I'm not saying--I want to be clear--

499
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I'm not saying that once you deal with this,

500
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 as soon as you deal with your baggage,

501
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 God's going to send you someone.

502
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 I'm not saying that.

503
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 You may deal with your baggage, and you may walk outside and get hit by a meteor.

504
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 I don't know, man. That may happen.

505
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 You may get up to heaven and be like, "What was that all about?

506
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 "If you wanted my attention, you could have just spoke to me or something.

507
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 "You didn't have to send a meteor."

508
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 But I know what won't happen. You won't get up there and be like,

509
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 "Hey, why wasn't I married?"

510
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 You'll be like, "Oh, wow.

511
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 "What is marriage?

512
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 "I'm married to the bridegroom of Jesus Christ

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 "for the rest of eternity."

514
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Nobody's married up there. I don't know if you knew that.

515
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Nobody's married in heaven.

516
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Scripture says that explicitly.

517
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Someone who hasn't forgiven someone else is carrying around weight

518
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 that will expose itself in times of trouble.

519
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Sometimes people say, "I can forgive others. I just can't forgive myself."

520
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 You're right. You can't forgive yourself.

521
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 You didn't sin against yourself.

522
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 You can't forgive yourself. You sinned against God.

523
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Others will use that semantics, terminology.

524
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 I don't have a problem with it, but I'll just let you know.

525
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 You're not trying to forgive yourself.

526
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 You're trying to receive the grace that God is freely extending to you right now

527
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 and understand that He's forgiven you

528
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 and that He's making you into something.

529
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 He already sees the finished product.

530
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 He loves it immensely.

531
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Not some future version of you.

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Not what you're becoming.

533
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 He loves the finished product of what He's going to do in your life.

534
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 He already sees it as such.

535
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 "Do not lie," verse 9.

536
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 "Do not lie to each other,

537
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 "since you have taken off your old self with its practices

538
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 "and have put on the new self,

539
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 "which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."

540
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Since you have taken off your old self with its practices

541
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 and you've put on this new self,

542
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 which is being renewed in the knowledge, the reality,

543
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 renewing your mind, Romans 12, 1 and 2 says,

544
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 around that there is a Creator

545
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 and that He's going to turn you.

546
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 He's finishing a work that He started in you,

547
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 making you into the image of Jesus Christ, His Son,

548
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 perfected at glorification forever and ever and ever and ever.

549
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And He's not holding your abortion against you,

550
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 your sex against you, your pornography against you,

551
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 your alcoholism against you, your gambling against you,

552
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 your hurts, your sexual abuse.

553
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 That what you did, that's what was done to you.

554
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 It's not being held against you.

555
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 He's forgiving you for it.

556
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 He's set you free from it.

557
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 But you don't feel free because you're carrying that baggage.

558
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 The last one, it's a big one.

559
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Big baggage in marriage.

560
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It's unchecked lies.

561
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Lies left unchecked will lead you astray.

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Lies left unchecked lead you astray.

563
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 See, you came in tonight and you have all of these preconceived notions

564
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 of what dating and marriage and sex and all of these things are,

565
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 but they're not informed by the Scripture.

566
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 They're informed by Cosmo, they're informed by TV,

567
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 they're informed by movies, romantic comedies,

568
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 they're informed by the Internet.

569
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Oh my goodness.

570
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And so, can I just say, you're believing lies in this room.

571
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 You have bought all of these lies that, hey, it's all about your happiness

572
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 and all of this craziness and eternity has zero implications

573
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 on what you believe about marriage and dating.

574
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 You have to renew your mind.

575
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And so this is that baggage.

576
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Like I said, it's a big one.

577
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 The lies that we believe.

578
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 These are the clothes that you bought because someone else convinced you

579
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 they were cool.

580
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 My Yeezys, who knew?

581
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 How'd those get in there?

582
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Sorority shirt, Coyotes in the house.

583
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Those things that you did because you wanted to fit in.

584
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Clothes you wore because you wanted to fit in.

585
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Clothes that culture said, hey, this is what the style is.

586
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 This is where you need to go.

587
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 You're being influenced by external influences.

588
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Some of them are wrong and you've believed lies.

589
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And so what happens in marriage, have you ever done this?

590
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Have you ever got to the gate or the baggage check

591
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 and your bag has to be under 50 pounds?

592
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 That one, that's mine. It never is.

593
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 You get up there and it's like 54 pounds and then you have to unzip it.

594
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Has this ever happened to anybody?

595
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 You have to unzip it and shuffle around.

596
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 You do the shuffle.

597
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 You're like, okay, here's my bottle of Don Julio tequila.

598
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 No, I'm just kidding.

599
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 That has to go somewhere else.

600
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 We've got to move this around and put that there and this, that, whatever.

601
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 And all you're doing, and this is what happens in marriage,

602
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 is you begin to shuffle around the lies that you've believed

603
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 throughout the years.

604
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Oh, what? We're not going to make love every single day of our lives?

605
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Marriage isn't all about that? What?

606
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 You're not going to come to bed every night in lingerie? What?

607
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Oh, this really isn't about tips and tricks? What?

608
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 It's not about performance? What?

609
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Oh, we do that less than one half a percent of our lives? What?

610
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Oh, God speaks into how many kids we should have?

611
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Those sorts of things? What?

612
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Oh, community matter? What? Church membership? What?

613
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And you begin to learn new things, renewing your mind

614
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 around what the Creator has for you.

615
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Proverbs 4:23 says, "Above all else, guard your heart,

616
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 for everything you do flows from it."

617
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Your version might say, "Keep your heart with all vigilance,

618
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 for out of it everything in life flows."

619
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 What it's saying, friends, is that you've got to be careful

620
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 what you let in your heart, because what you put in your heart

621
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 takes you places.

622
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And when you begin to inform your heart around what love is,

623
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 what dating is, and what marriage is, and it's lies,

624
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 you go into marriage, and every single person,

625
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 every pre-married couple Monica and I have done pre-married counseling with,

626
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 every single one of them have struggled with bad expectations.

627
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And it's because the culture has fed their bad expectations.

628
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 So we sit in our living room, we go through how awful their expectations are,

629
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 they call me two months later and tell me that we were right,

630
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 but they didn't believe us when we said that.

631
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And it's just these rose-colored glasses that we wear,

632
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 or these terrible expectations that we have.

633
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And so where does it come from? It can come from your friends.

634
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Some of you, you came here by yourself because no one would come with you.

635
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 "What? Aren't we going to church on Tuesday?"

636
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 No, no thanks.

637
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And you realize you have no positive influences.

638
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 You don't have community, you're not really a part of the church.

639
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 You're sitting on the outside looking in,

640
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 and you know that you keep going to the same places

641
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 hoping that something else happens.

642
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 You return to the same sins like a dog to his vomit.

643
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 And it's because those around you are such strong influences on your life.

644
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And for you, my friends, what I would say to you is you need to change your playmates

645
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 and your playground.

646
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 "What? You want me to just stop being friends with them?"

647
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 I want you to stop being friends with them.

648
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 "What do you mean?" Stop.

649
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Talking, calling, going over, hanging out with.

650
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 That feels unloving.

651
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 It may be the most loving thing you can do.

652
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Most God-honoring thing you can do.

653
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 "I'm not going to go to the bar with you anymore.

654
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 "I'm not going to do that anymore."

655
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 It can be your parents.

656
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Your parents didn't make you a sinner, but they gave you some great sins to choose from.

657
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 They passed their baggage on to you.

658
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Some of you, your mother was a worrier.

659
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Anybody's mom a worrier? Don't raise your hand. That wouldn't be loving.

660
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 You go out with your friends, she's like, "Where are you going?

661
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 "Text me when you get there, text me when you get home."

662
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 "Who's driving? He's got a driver's license? What?"

663
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 She's out there with breathalyzer tests, you know, I mean, she's crazy.

664
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Right?

665
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And today that looks like, "Why aren't you married yet?

666
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 "Aren't there some good guys in that church?"

667
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Oh, man. Thanks, Mom, for that encouragement. Marriage motivator.

668
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Just marry someone.

669
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 As long as you're happy.

670
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 And they tell you stupid things.

671
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Like it's about your happiness.

672
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Parents love to say that.

673
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 It's not about your happiness. Life's not about you.

674
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 You were put here by someone else, and life is all about him.

675
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 You living for him.

676
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Comes from magazines, lots of magazines.

677
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Teach you tips and tricks you never see.

678
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 I always walk through the grocery store aisle, I'm like, "Who buys these things?"

679
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 But evidently people do, because there's always new ones out there.

680
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 And they say the dumbest things. They never say, they never have said this,

681
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 they never say, "Hey, here's how to be married for 60 years."

682
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 It's the headline that I've never seen. It's always, "Tips and tricks.

683
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 "Here's how to get his attention." You know who reads that?

684
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Women who've been married six times read that.

685
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 That's who read that.

686
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 They're always trying to get his attention. It says dumb things like,

687
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 "Seven tips to get her to orgasm."

688
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 And what, you know, it's the O word, I know.

689
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 And here's what it does, and this is why I'm grieved for you.

690
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 This is why I'm grieved for you, because I've talked to so many of you

691
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 who go into marriage with performance anxiety.

692
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Because the culture has taught you,

693
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 this is all about you working your moves.

694
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Oh my goodness. Read the Bible.

695
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 Okay?

696
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Learn to pursue intimacy.

697
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Learn to understand

698
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 from the one who created the act.

699
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 I mean, those people

700
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 that are all about being great lovers

701
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 get divorced and remarried and divorced and remarried and divorced.

702
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 And just in case, like you, the enemy's tempted,

703
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 "Oh, well, he just, maybe he's got problems." No, listen.

704
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Monica and I, no, we don't have problems in regards to that area.

705
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Okay? Things are going quite well.

706
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Listen, listen. But I will tell you this.

707
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Listen. Back with me. But I took a lot of baggage

708
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 into marriage. I took a lot of

709
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 baggage into marriage. And it took

710
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 seasons of healing.

711
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 And it just gets better and better and better. My friend told me

712
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 so many of these young adults think the goody bag

713
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 is the word he used, happens on the honeymoon.

714
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 He's been married for a long time. He says,

715
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 "The goody bag happens in the 35 years of pursuing intimacy."

716
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 And it just gets better and better

717
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 and better. And we just don't think that way.

718
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 We just don't understand

719
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 what God has desired for this. I want you to,

720
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 I want you to understand a better way. We learn this

721
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 from movies and TV. You've never seen that show

722
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 that really gives you a biblical view of relationships.

723
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Lots of worldly views, though.

724
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 So I want you to think about where you're getting

725
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 relationship advice from.

726
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 A guy tells me the other day,

727
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 he was at a kid's birthday party.

728
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 He's on his fourth wife. And he says, "JP, come here.

729
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 I want to give you some relationship advice."

730
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 I said, "No thanks."

731
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 He said, "Well, I've had lots of practice."

732
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 I said, "That doesn't make you an expert, bro.

733
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 I've got an expert.

734
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 I've got community.

735
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 No offense, but I don't want your relationship advice."

736
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 People write in all the time.

737
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 They email and say, "Hey, JP, I just want your opinion

738
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 on something." No, you don't.

739
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 You don't want my opinion. I hope you don't.

740
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 I hope you want to understand.

741
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 I mean, if you want me to clarify a verse or give you

742
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 what I think that means or send you some commentaries

743
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 or suggest some resources, but I'm not an advice column.

744
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 I'm not here to give you my opinion on anything.

745
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 I want you to know what God

746
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 desires for you from the instruction

747
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 that He's given us.

748
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 We check our baggage

749
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 because it's cumbersome, it's reckless, it's hard to carry around.

750
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 That's why we check it. We don't carry it with us on the plane.

751
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 That's why we unpack it as soon as we get somewhere.

752
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Could you imagine carrying all that stuff around all the time?

753
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 So application quickly. If you came in with addictions,

754
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 you may need to trust in Christ that He's forgiven

755
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 your sins through His death and resurrection on the cross.

756
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 That He's paid for it. He saw all the porn

757
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 that you saw in a moment when He paid for it.

758
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 And it crushed Him. And it cost Him His life.

759
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 He paid for everything

760
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 that you've done wrong. He paid for that abortion.

761
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 It cost Him His life. But He did it because

762
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 He loves you. He's crazy about you. He did it to set you

763
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 free.

764
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 You need to confess. Bring it to the light.

765
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 Stop hiding it. And you need to pursue recovery.

766
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Man, if you're looking at porn,

767
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 you shouldn't be dating. If you're having sex,

768
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 the most loving thing that you may be able to do right now,

769
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 the most loving thing you should do is break up.

770
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Say, "Hey, we need to put the brakes on this.

771
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Pull the parking brake. Take some time.

772
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Pursue healing.

773
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 Get right with God. Understand what really matters in life.

774
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Stop training for adultery.

775
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Stop training ourselves for sex

776
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 outside of marriage. I don't want to train myself to cheat on you anymore

777
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 by having sex with you outside of marriage."

778
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Some of you, what you need to do tonight is

779
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 go on your Outlook calendar, move forward six months

780
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 or a year, and just write in the subject line,

781
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 "Date again." And between now and then,

782
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 go into regen,

783
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 go into biblical recovery,

784
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 and heal. And it'll be the most loving thing

785
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 you could do for your spouse. If you came in angry from past hurts,

786
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 pursue healing. Identify the source of those

787
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 hurts. We have all kinds. We have someone cares,

788
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 shelter from the storm, men. If it's sexual abuse,

789
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 we have people who are here that

790
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 what they do every day is they exist to help

791
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 you recover from that

792
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 in a godly way, be it an abortion, be it an abuse,

793
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 whatever it is, but you've got

794
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 to bring it to the light. If it's parents,

795
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 a relationship, you've got to forgive. That scripture

796
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 says, "Forgive as God also has forgiven you."

797
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Forgive. Some of you, what that means

798
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 is you need to leave here. You realize that you've been a part of

799
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 the hurts of someone else, and you need to go to them, if at all appropriate,

800
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 and say, "Will you forgive me? When we dated,

801
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 I took advantage of you, and I need to ask your forgiveness."

802
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Now, if they're married, I'd be wise. I would talk

803
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 about that in the context of your community. It may be a letter,

804
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 it may be an email, it may not be appropriate.

805
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 But some of you, you realize that the Rolodex

806
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 is going through your mind, and you need to leave here and seek people

807
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 out and say, "Will you forgive me? Because I look back and I realize

808
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 that I hurt you. I put weight

809
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 in your life."

810
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 It says, "Therefore, as God's

811
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourself,"

812
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 this is verse 12, "with compassion, kindness, humility,

813
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 gentleness, and patience." Isn't that beautiful that Christ

814
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 gives us new clothes to wear? It's amazing.

815
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 He gives us new clothes to wear. These clothes look good on everyone.

816
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 They always fit. They're suitable for every

817
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 occasion. Humility. No one's ever worn humility

818
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 and looked bad in it. Humility looks

819
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 good on everyone. Gentleness looks good on everyone. Patience looks good

820
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 on everyone. Compassion and kindness. These are clothes

821
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 that look good on everyone. "Bear with each other and forgive

822
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 one another," he writes. "If any of you has a grievance

823
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 against someone, forgive as the Lord forgave you.

824
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 And over all these virtues, put on love,"

825
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 the love we talked about last week. Adam did a great job

826
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 speaking of this love last week, "which binds them all together

827
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 in perfect unity."

828
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 And if you came in this evening believing lies, I want you

829
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 to cut off the source of those lies. You may need to leave

830
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 here and stop watching romantic comedies. Stop watching

831
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 that sitcom that is feeding your heart a

832
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 view of what marriage is.

833
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 I said already, change your playmates in your playground. Cut off the TV

834
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 and open your Bible.

835
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Friends, it's faithfulness in one direction.

836
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Long obedience in the same direction. Okay?

837
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 You can trust in Christ tonight if you haven't,

838
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 but sanctification is a process.

839
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 And some of you, you need discipleship. You need

840
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 to sit down with someone and learn this

841
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 book and make the ingestion of these scriptures a daily

842
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 part of your life.

843
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 For the rest of your life.

844
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 That this would be a daily part of your

845
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 existence on this earth is knowing God's

846
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 will for you. And renewing

847
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 your mind and your heart around the Holy

848
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Scriptures. Following

849
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 His spirit over the advice of

850
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Cosmo and Maxim and men's health.

851
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 Friends, you need more than just will and want.

852
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Some of you are like, well, I want to

853
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 stop looking at porn. I want to forgive that person. You need

854
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 more than just will and want.

855
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 You need a plan for recovery.

856
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 You need discipleship.

857
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 You need to plug into a healthy body of church.

858
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 Begin to prioritize the things of Christ.

859
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 And put on new clothes.

860
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 We, Monica and I went back to

861
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 that resort for our 10 year anniversary. It was so amazing

862
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 to sit in that same place

863
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 10 years later and reflect on what God has done.

864
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 I've told you before, even earlier tonight, almost got divorced

865
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 year two. And then God just began

866
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 to heal us in such a way that today we have this

867
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 incredible marriage. These three amazing kids. We get to

868
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 talk to people about marriage. Share our struggles and learnings with them.

869
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 She's the most amazing wife

870
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 for me, I'll say. I love her so

871
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 much. And it was great to celebrate that

872
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 and specifically talk about the healing

873
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 that we encountered through Christ.

874
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 And on our way back from Mexico, celebrating

875
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 10 years of marriage, we got diverted from Dallas to Houston.

876
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 We got to Houston about midnight. We sat on the tarmac

877
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 for a while. We eventually were able to deplane.

878
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 And they had sent, at Houston Hobby, they had sent

879
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 customs home. And so we got stuck at

880
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 baggage claim. We're there at baggage claim

881
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 and they said, "We cannot let you into the country because we've sent customs

882
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 home." And we're just sitting there

883
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 with our baggage and we can't move forward.

884
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 And this,

885
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 after about an hour and a half, somebody called

886
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 a gentleman who was at home with his family,

887
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 sleeping I imagine, and he drove back

888
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 to the airport and he let us in.

889
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 He let us move forward. That's what Christ does.

890
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 Some of you here tonight, you feel

891
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 like you can't move forward with your baggage.

892
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 You can't stop. You can't get out of that trap.

893
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 You can't forgive. You don't know what to do.

894
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 He came

895
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 to give you some new clothes.

896
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 I got to tell you,

897
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 the blood of Christ covers

898
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 your sins. He has a covering

899
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 for all this stuff.

900
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 Oh, what's that doing in there?

901
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 Righteous clothes.

902
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 He takes your baggage.

903
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 He took it on Himself, guys.

904
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 He came to give you

905
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 a new life to heal you.

906
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 Make you spotless.

907
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 That's what He did.

908
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 He set you free. The scripture, this in Colossians,

909
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 it starts with this beautiful text. I'm just going to read it to you.

910
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 Verses 1-4 says, "Since then you have been raised

911
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 with Christ. Set your hearts on things above where Christ

912
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds

913
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 on the things above, not on earthly things, for you died

914
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 and your life is now," listen, "your life is now hidden

915
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 with Christ in God. When Christ,

916
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 who is your life, appears, you then also

917
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 appear with Him in glory." And isn't

918
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 it amazing that God sees not your

919
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 sin, but His payment.

920
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 God sees not your sin,

921
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 but His covering. God sees not

922
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 your baggage, but His righteousness.

923
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 God sees not your life,

924
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 but the perfect life of His Son.

925
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 And He gives you an inheritance,

926
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 His glory, forever and ever

927
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 and ever and ever and ever

928
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 and a million years from now you're still

929
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 with Him. And nobody's up there living with the

930
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 regret of that abortion,

931
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 the addiction, the drunkenness,

932
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 the pornography, the relationship that you

933
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 swore, completely coded, "There's no way I could

934
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 live without Him." He says, "Yes you can.

935
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 You're my son, you're my daughter.

936
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 I've come to give you

937
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 a new life.

938
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 To give you life so that you might live it to the full.

939
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 So you might live it with

940
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 me." And I'm just crazy

941
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 enough to think that in His

942
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 sovereignty and power that He would have you right now

943
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 here listening to this

944
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 to remind you

945
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 that He's crazy about you.

946
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 He's in love with you.

947
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 That He forgives you.

948
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 He's gone to incredible, great

949
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 lengths to forgive you, but you've got to move past

950
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 yourself and begin to live your

951
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 life for Him.

952
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 Every day for Him.

953
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 Faithfulness, long

954
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 obedience in the same direction.

955
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 Discipleship, recovery.

956
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 And begin to work on your marriage.

957
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 That may happen even 10 years from now.

958
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 You can work on it now as you

959
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 work on you and surrender to Christ

960
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 to make His work for you.

961
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 So I'm going to pray that you would do that.

962
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 And we're going to worship.

963
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 Christ, you said

964
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 verse 13 that we've been forgiven.

965
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 You said over and over

966
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 and over that that's not who we are.

967
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 We're not those things.

968
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 That we've been made perfect in your image.

969
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 Would you help us to see ourselves

970
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 as you see us?

971
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 Thank you for forgiveness through the cross.

972
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 Thank you for new life,

973
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 new creation that is no longer us who live

974
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 in the flesh, but your spirit

975
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 that lives in us, perfecting us,

976
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 making us new.

977
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 Father, thank you that we can bring our

978
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 baggage to the altar, that we can

979
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 check it there, and that we can move forward

980
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 as your sons and your daughters.

981
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 Is how the enemy lies to us

982
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 and says that

983
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 like, "Hey, you can't be fun if you're a Christian.

984
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 And you have to die to the excitement

985
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 of life. You have to settle for something

986
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 bland." I've met few people

987
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 who have partied

988
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 and engaged in debauchery

989
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 in the ways that I did.

990
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 And I've found treasure, world.

991
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 I've found

992
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 treasure. Today I bear my cross as I wait

993
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 for the crown, but I've got to tell you something.

994
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 His burden is light. His yoke

995
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 is easy.

996
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 He did the hard part for me.

997
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 And like this weekend, there's going to be a thousand

998
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 people having a better

999
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 time than they've ever had at any club with any

1000
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 bottle service or taking shots or doing

1001
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 any strip club, anything.

1002
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 And I know this, I don't say that naively, I know

1003
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 this because they come up to me and they're like, "Man, you wouldn't believe my story."

1004
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 Yes, I would. You won't surprise me.

1005
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 No offense, I just hear it every day.

1006
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 I found life in Christ. He set me free.

1007
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 Hey, some of you need not

1008
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 to leave. You need to find

1009
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 somebody with a shirt with a yellow light bulb

1010
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 on it, and you need to go up to them and say, "I need to talk to you.

1011
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 I need to confess my abortion

1012
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 to you. I need to confess my addiction to pornography

1013
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 to you. I need to confess that this week

1014
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 I had sex with my boyfriend/girlfriend.

1015
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 I have a gambling addiction."

1016
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 Whatever that is. Don't leave without telling somebody.

1017
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 And that's step one.

1018
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 But it's not the end. It's not the finish line.

1019
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 I want you to pursue recovery.

1020
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 You can show up here, this same room,

1021
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 Monday night at 630. It's not a room full

1022
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 of weirdos. It's a room full of broken people.

1023
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 It's the healthiest place in our church.

1024
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 And say, "Hey, help me with recovery.

1025
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 Come in with any addiction."

1026
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 And they would love to do that.

1027
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 If you're looking for community, if you realize

1028
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 you don't have that, tonight we have open community group.

1029
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 Guys, you can walk down this hallway. And girls, you can walk down that

1030
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 hallway, and there's a room full of people also looking

1031
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 for community. And if you're here in college,

1032
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 we do have our college hangout on the second floor.

1033
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 And I'll just reiterate, if you're a freshman, don't be a fool.

1034
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 Sign up for LaunchU. If we can help you do that, if money's the issue,

1035
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 talk to us. But we want you out there.

1036
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 It's going to be amazing, and we've saved spots for you.

1037
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
 So you need to do that tonight if you're waiting until last minute.

1038
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 Tonight's last minute. So make that happen.

1039
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
 I love you guys. If we can serve you in any way, let us know.

1040
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 Peace, love, and serve the Lord.
