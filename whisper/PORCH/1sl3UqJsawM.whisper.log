[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.440]   - All right, what's up guys?
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.360]   Welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.080]   friends in Fort Worth and El Paso and Houston
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.440]   and Tulsa and Ohio and Iowa and Florida
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   and wherever else you are joining us
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.720]   and especially welcome fellow Dallasites,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.200]   home of the Mavs.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.640]   And not our strongest start so far,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.120]   but hey, we're continuing this series, Vice and Virtue.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.960]   I'm gonna start with a story
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.320]   that'll give us some traction.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.800]   When I moved to Dallas from the University of Texas A&M,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.240]   I-- (audience cheering)
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.040]   Man, it gets me every time.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.040]   Didn't see that coming, love it.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800]   I moved into a back house for a little bit
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.080]   and then eventually moved into,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.760]   a friend of mine had a house in Lakewood,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.360]   which is an area in Dallas,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.320]   and me and another guy moved in with him
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.880]   and it was like, it just felt like adulting
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.000]   for the first time in a while.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.720]   We weren't in an apartment or a dorm
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.760]   or like a back house or a garage apartment.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.320]   We were in kind of like your own home
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.560]   with a yard you gotta mow and just responsibilities.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.760]   And one of the things inside of the house
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   was it had a fireplace.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.000]   It wasn't a wood fireplace,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.280]   it was a gas fire or gas log fireplace.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.560]   And I, well, you'll know why I say that in a second.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.840]   And so I moved into the house,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.880]   it was kind of wintertime
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.520]   and I was in grad school at the time.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.640]   So on one of the earlier nights that I was there,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.040]   I decided, well, everyone else had plans that evening
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.560]   and I had to study for an exam that was kind of,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.640]   so I stood home, was reading and decided,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.680]   I'm gonna light a fire.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.520]   It's cold outside, light this gas log fireplace.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.420]   So gas logs don't produce smoke
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.040]   like a wood fire would do.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440]   So you just turn it on, it's pretty awesome,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.040]   turn it on, light it and welcome to 2018.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.000]   So I light the fire, I'm reading a book,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.480]   I end up falling asleep on the couch.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.280]   My roommate comes home and he's the guy who owns a home.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280]   He says, oh man, hey, great call.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.320]   Kind of wakes me up, great call
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.720]   in lighting the fireplace, it's freezing outside.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.460]   Hey, you made sure to open the flu, right?
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.040]   And I said, what are you talking about?
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.800]   Open the flu, yeah, you open the flu.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.080]   What are you, pause, let me hit pause on the story
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   because if you don't know what the flu is,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.000]   like me, circa eight years ago,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.680]   you're going, what, open the flu?
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.520]   What are you talking about?
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.880]   Like the thing that is infecting half of America right now?
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.320]   Is that what you mean by flu?
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.520]   The flu, the chimney flu,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.440]   is altogether different than this virus.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.560]   The chimney flu is the thing inside of the chimney
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.000]   that you open up or has to be opened up
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and it allows, if it's a wood fire,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.520]   the smoke to go up the chimney
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.720]   and if it is a gas log burning fire,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.820]   the carbon monoxide that will kill you
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.840]   to go out the chimney.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.320]   And so I'm going, what are you talking about?
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.440]   You didn't open up the flu?
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.320]   He turns off the fire, he goes, opens up the flu,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.400]   starts opening doors, he's like,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.380]   how long has the fire been burning?
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.280]   And I'm like, several hours at this point.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.600]   And he's like, you know, that will kill you.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.400]   And I'm like, what are you talking about, it'll kill you?
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.480]   I would have realized or smelled it
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.760]   or sensed there's something wrong.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.800]   No, carbon monoxide, you can't see it, you can't smell it,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.760]   you can't sense that it's there.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.680]   And yet, if you breathe it in, it will kill you.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.000]   And it is the thing filling your lungs right now
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.840]   in this house.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.820]   And so we're like now scrambling,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.760]   trying to get the air out.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I'm going, oh my gosh, you go into like panic mode.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.040]   Like, do I need to go to a doctor right now?
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.020]   I'm starting to feel funny.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.840]   And so I did what any guy does,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.680]   didn't go to the doctor.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.920]   I just began looking up the worst possible case scenario
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.520]   on Wikipedia and finding out what would happen
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.180]   if you inhale large amounts of carbon monoxide.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.360]   Thankfully, he came home and thankfully,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.080]   everything ended up working out fine.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.540]   But the reason I start there is because just like
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.680]   in that scenario, where there was something in the air
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.040]   that I was breathing that was killing me
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.360]   and would kill me from the inside out,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.520]   we are talking tonight about a vice that is in the air
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.980]   that we breathe as Americans
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.560]   that is killing us from the inside out.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.880]   And it is the vice of entitlement.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.200]   Entitlement.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.360]   Throughout this series, Vice and Virtue,
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   we essentially go and we look at some of the biggest vices
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.640]   of our generation and really kind of inside of our culture
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.460]   and couple them with the virtue, the biblical virtue,
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.600]   that should replace them.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.840]   Entitlement, what do I mean by it's in the air
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.680]   that we breathe?
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.500]   What does it mean to be entitled?
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.480]   Entitlement, what I mean by that is just this
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.920]   really pervasive attitude all across our country
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.680]   and just all of us that can be easily
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.620]   and endlessly almost focused on hey, what I deserve,
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.280]   what I'm owed, what I'm entitled to.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.880]   And it is something that when I say it's in the air
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.040]   that we breathe, it truly is.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.920]   I mean, just kind of as Americans, we're all about like,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.480]   hey, you're owed this, you deserve this.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.040]   We live in a culture that's on demand more than ever before
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.120]   that just constantly feeds it, where it's like,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.740]   man, I can't have a pizza in five minutes.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.700]   I can order some from Jeff Bezos in Amazon
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.240]   and it'll be here in two hours.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.000]   We are fed kind of this like, hey, you earned it,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.560]   you deserve it, and our expectations are higher than ever.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.840]   And as we're gonna see tonight,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.920]   our expectations are directly connected
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.160]   to this sense of entitlement.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.060]   I mean, it's such a part of even just materialism.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.020]   Marketers, if you studied marketing in college,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.240]   you probably came across what marketing studies
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.000]   will show you is marketers will try to convince you
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.240]   you deserve something, you earned it, you work hard,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   you have earned this car, this vacation,
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.080]   this whatever it is.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.600]   And so not only is it in the air that we're breathing,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.400]   there's something just a part of our sin nature
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.440]   where it is like easy for me, with no effort,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.640]   things in my life to quickly move to
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.880]   I feel entitled to them.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.960]   Things that were like, oh, this is an amazing gift,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.440]   one week, the next week becomes something
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.280]   I just feel entitled to.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.400]   Example, last week at the porch, if you were here,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.700]   it was like seven degrees outside, so we decided,
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.320]   hey, we're gonna go pick everyone up in golf carts
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.480]   so that if you're really far away,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.080]   we'll go pick you up at the golf cart.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.020]   So people, some of our volunteers are driving around
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.080]   picking up people at the five-story parking garage
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.180]   and like the joy on people's faces,
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.700]   you would have thought like we were handing out
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.440]   just suitcases of cash to people,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.760]   like, oh my gosh, this is amazing, thank you so much.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.880]   And they'd get inside of the golf cart,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.960]   they'd ride through.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.040]   You know what happens the next week
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.280]   when you had a golf cart show up
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.000]   and pick you up at the fifth-story parking garage?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.720]   You're like, where's the stinking golf carts?
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.080]   You serious, huh?
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.720]   I'm having to walk a stinking mile to get to church,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.680]   there's no golf carts here.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.080]   What is wrong with this place?
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.920]   I'm going somewhere else.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.380]   I mean, it just quickly, with no effort at all,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.000]   we move in the direction of entitlement.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.080]   It's in the air that we breathe,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.440]   it's just kind of a part of our DNA,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.400]   and it's very easy for us to get there,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.840]   and yet it is without question,
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.100]   it is impacting our relationships in a toxic way.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.840]   It is gonna rob, it does rob all of us of joy and gratitude.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.480]   And I think most of us are unaware.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.800]   Similar to carbon monoxide, we're like,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.840]   I can't see it.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.240]   It's like almost, here's what I thought
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.440]   when I was preparing this message this week.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.680]   I was like, this might be the first time
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.400]   I've ever given a message where I'm like,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.600]   I don't think this is a problem for me.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.360]   I think I got entitlement down.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.520]   Like, I don't think I'm that entitled to things.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.040]   And literally, as I'm writing and working on it yesterday,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.160]   JP and Garrett, who's in Fort Worth,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.400]   and I will prepare messages together
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.480]   and we'll kind of like, you know,
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.360]   pick up the phone and work
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.720]   and just talk through different things.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.200]   Neither of them, and so that was the plan.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.720]   Hey, Friday or Monday afternoon,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   we'll connect and we'll have chances to do that.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.320]   And for whatever reason, because of a fire thing
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.440]   in Fort Worth, a big fire that kind of broke out,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.320]   Garrett had some lack of availability
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.080]   and JP had similar circumstances.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.360]   And I'm sitting there going, what the heck, you guys?
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.000]   I thought we were gonna work on this thing together.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.060]   And you want me to write this entitlement message
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.900]   all on my own?
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.960]   Are you serious?
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.200]   I'm entitled to have some people
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.720]   help me out here a little bit.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.640]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, I thought I had this thing down.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.760]   Turns out maybe I don't.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.600]   And here's what I think.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.920]   I think that's how all of us are.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.520]   I don't think anyone in the room really,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.000]   when we think entitled, we think of the kid who's like,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.080]   dad, my Range Rover has 20 miles on it.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.320]   Can we change it out, please?
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.600]   We don't think like, oh, maybe I'm entitled.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.220]   Maybe there's parts of me that like have expectations
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.580]   or is more focused on what I deserve and what I'm owed
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.480]   and what God hasn't given me or what my boss should give me
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.360]   and how much I should make that there's a part of all of us
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.200]   that is entitled.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.000]   Tonight, Jesus is gonna display through a parable
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.080]   in Matthew chapter 20.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.080]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Matthew chapter 20
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.020]   he is going to show us some of the cause
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.980]   that stems or where our entitlement stems from,
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.740]   what it does to the relationships that we have
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.320]   and then the remedy that we're given
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.540]   to kill entitlement inside of our lives.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.640]   So Matthew chapter 20, we're gonna start in really verse 30
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.080]   of chapter 19, right before it,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.880]   Jesus would often tell a parable.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.680]   A parable is kind of like a made up story
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.040]   and it is a made up story.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.480]   It was a made up story that Jesus would tell
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.600]   in order to make a point or in order to teach something.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.840]   And so on this one, he gives his disciples this parable
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.560]   and in so doing gives us a look
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.200]   into the problems of entitlement and the cure for it.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.960]   So verse 30 of chapter 19, here's what it says.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.320]   Jesus speaking, "But many who are first will be last
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.580]   "and many who are last will be first.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.560]   "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.760]   "who went out early in the morning
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.020]   "to hire workers for his vineyard.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.680]   "He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.080]   "and he sent them into the vineyard."
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.360]   So Jesus starts saying, hey, let me tell you
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.240]   kind of what kingdom of heaven, how it works,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.080]   what it's like.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.880]   It's like a guy owns this plot of land,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.720]   it's a vineyard, he's got grapes growing,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.320]   he's gonna make some wine, decides,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.080]   I need some people to work on this field.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.520]   Goes over to Home Depot, whatever they had at the time,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.200]   says, hey guys, do you wanna work for the day?
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.320]   I'll pay you a denarius.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.720]   Here's what you need to know about a denarius.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.780]   Essentially, denarius is like above minimum wage.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.260]   It would be like 15 to $20 an hour times eight hours.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.220]   So for the day's wage, I'm gonna pay you really well.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.060]   Will you come work?
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.300]   They agree to work.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.380]   The man sends them into the field.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.620]   It's early in the morning, maybe six or 7 a.m.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.040]   Story continues.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.280]   "About nine in the morning, the landowner went out
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.940]   "and he saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.180]   "He told them, you also go and work in my vineyard
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.820]   "and I will pay you whatever is right.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.220]   "So they went.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.340]   "And he went out again at about noon
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.560]   "and about three in the afternoon
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.520]   "and he did the same thing."
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.140]   So the guy goes out at nine, says,
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.000]   hey, do you wanna work today?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.520]   Go out in the field, I'll pay you whatever's right.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.240]   Goes out at noon, hey, do you wanna work today?
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.520]   Finds more people, go out,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.960]   and apparently it's a big vineyard.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.440]   And he finds people again at three o'clock.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.120]   Hey, whatever's right, I'll pay you, go out there.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.600]   Then finally, at about five in the afternoon,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.120]   now there's only one hour left in the workday.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.480]   The workday ended at six o'clock.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.120]   So at five in the afternoon, he goes out again
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.880]   and he's like, hey, do you wanna work today?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.080]   Sends them out with one hour left in the day,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.000]   in the workday.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.520]   You may have the 11th hour in your text.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.660]   "He went out and he found others still standing around
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.880]   "and he asked them, why have you been standing here all day
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.720]   "doing nothing?
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.300]   "Because no one has hired us, verse seven they answered.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.680]   "He said to them, you also go and work in my vineyard.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.700]   "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.380]   "said to his foreman,
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.600]   "call the workers together and pay them
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.540]   "and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.880]   "that were hired and going on to the first."
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.680]   Which is unusual in this time.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.560]   Just like many times today,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.440]   you would pay the people who've been here the longest,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.400]   they're gonna get paid first.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   Those guys who just showed up, you'll get paid last.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.560]   But he says, we're gonna flip it.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.000]   And here's what happens.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.520]   "The workers who were hired at about five in the afternoon,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.360]   "the people who only worked one hour,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.240]   "they came and they each received a denarius.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.200]   "Each received 150 bucks.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.860]   "So when those who came who were hired first,
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.340]   "they expected to receive more."
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.460]   So they're sitting in line going,
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.120]   he just paid the one hour guys 150 bucks.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.540]   We've been here for 12, oh my gosh,
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.280]   we're gonna get like, you know, 100,000s of dollars.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.860]   They're already going through what they're gonna buy
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.860]   with their money, maybe a new camel,
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.060]   whatever you bought in that day for $1,200.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.540]   And they're beginning to think through it,
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.700]   expecting that because we've been here 12 times as long,
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.580]   we're gonna get 12 times as much.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.200]   "Having an attitude of what they thought they deserved."
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.400]   But here's what happens.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:13.240]   "But each one of them also received a denarius.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.800]   "And when they received it, they began to grumble."
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.640]   I'm gonna pause there.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.120]   The word grumble just means they became indignant.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.160]   So they're sitting in line
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.840]   and they're indignant at the landowner.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.900]   They're indignant in general because they felt entitled.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.160]   Not that they had been done wrong
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.280]   or not that, you know, the guy lied to them
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.120]   or kind of cheated on them.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.220]   He said, "I'll pay you a denarius."
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.140]   And they're sitting there going,
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.020]   "Hey, I feel like I deserve more."
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.460]   Our first idea from this text is that entitlement
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.900]   stems from what we think we deserve.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.500]   I know that sounds pretty straightforward,
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.980]   but it's a key in understanding how we can experience
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.820]   a cure for the entitlement that we experience.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.580]   That entitlement is just where you put the expectation,
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.580]   you begin to have the expectation
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.100]   of what you think you're owed
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.940]   or what you think that you deserved.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.380]   And anytime that those expectations are not met,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.220]   "Hey, I expected to be paid more,"
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.960]   it exposes the entitlement inside of our hearts.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   It exposes the entitlement.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.120]   Like maybe you've experienced this at work
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.720]   where your job came up and it's the, you know,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   about to transition to a new fiscal year
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.540]   and you're expecting, "I'm gonna get a promotion,
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.440]   "maybe some sort of raise," and it doesn't happen.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.080]   Worse yet, somebody else gets a promotion,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.420]   like, "Really, you gave Bob a promotion?
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.640]   "I didn't get a promotion," and it exposes entitlement.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.920]   This happens all the time where, you know,
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.440]   someone will start really running hard after Christ
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.080]   and they're diving in the community group
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.140]   and they are getting plugged in
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.480]   and they're serving and all of that.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.980]   And some point, they hit this wall
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.520]   where they begin to become bitter towards God
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.580]   that they're not where they want to be
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.640]   in their relationship status.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.260]   They're like, "Man, I thought if I got everything
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.000]   "kind of right and I really started following hard
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.740]   "after Christ that, you know, Mr. Right or Mrs. Right
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.300]   "would come along and God, you would, you know,
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.020]   "I thought I would be married by now
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.420]   "and have at least one on the way,"
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.840]   or if you're a guy, someone with one on the way,
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.740]   and it's not the case at all.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.200]   And it exposes the entitlement that's inside of their heart.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.560]   I mean, when tragically, honestly,
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.260]   when things inside of our life
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.500]   just kind of begin to fall apart,
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.600]   maybe a parent gets sick,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.980]   maybe something really tragic happens,
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.180]   people will get bitter at God.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.860]   And it reflects the fact that there was an entitlement
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.820]   inside of their heart that I felt entitled
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.780]   to have parents that lived.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.380]   I felt entitled to have good health.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.100]   I felt entitled to not lose my job.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.860]   And I'm angry at you for it, God.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.820]   Entitlement stems from us not getting
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.360]   what we think that we deserve.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.860]   And what the Bible tells us is that you and I are to not,
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.540]   the goal is to not, hey, so you need to make sure
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.140]   that you just lower your expectations
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.100]   of whatever you deserve.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.140]   The goal's not to lower them, the goal's not to raise them,
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.100]   it is to base them on what the Bible says you deserve.
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.840]   It is to live a life that stems from,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.100]   I am gonna base my expectations
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.260]   on what the Bible tells me I deserve.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.740]   I'm not gonna set my expectations
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.680]   on what I'm entitled to based on socially or culturally
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.600]   kind of what others have and what I don't.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.220]   I'm gonna set them biblically.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.240]   The Bible says if you're a Christian,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.660]   we should be the least entitled people in the world.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.220]   Because the Bible teaches that, hey, what is it,
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.780]   at the end of the day, what do I deserve?
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.100]   Hell, that's what I deserve.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.960]   That's what my sin deserves, that's what my life deserves.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.980]   Like, what does God owe me, or what am I owed?
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.820]   Hell.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.300]   And yet at the same time,
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.380]   it also tells us the incredible truth
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.700]   that the God who's there provided a way,
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.640]   dying in our place, so that we could have eternal life.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.780]   That I was owed, I deserve hell,
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.660]   that's where I should align my expectations,
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.660]   and yet God, in his incredible love for me,
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.740]   despite the fact that I don't deserve it,
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.860]   died in my place, has promised me
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.180]   eternity with him in paradise forever.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.240]   In other words, not just, hey, you don't have to go to hell,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.460]   you get to spend eternity in paradise.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.860]   It's be comparable to, hey, I'm not just gonna pay off
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.900]   your student loans, I'm gonna give you $10 billion.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.780]   That's what we have been given inside of Christ.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.460]   That it's not just that, hey, we weren't given,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.940]   or what we deserve is hell,
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.100]   and God has now promised us something,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.740]   which is eternal life with him forever.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.340]   And the Bible presents this idea, it's pretty crazy,
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.340]   that that should be enough.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.340]   I mean, isn't that like, it almost just,
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.820]   'cause we're Americans, we're like, man,
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.400]   what an American dream, that it's insane
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.500]   that at some point in time, that stopped being enough.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.460]   That, hey, you don't have to go spend eternity
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.020]   away from God forever in hell, eternally separated from him,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   you get to spend eternity with him forever.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.000]   And even inside of this room, it's like, oh my gosh,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.700]   well, that is not coming for a while, I hope.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.540]   So is there something else that you can give me?
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.500]   So here, what now should we expect?
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.060]   That's what we deserved, we weren't given that,
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.620]   we were promised by God eternal life forever and ever.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.260]   So what should we expect from God now in this life?
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.700]   Nothing.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.780]   Or at least nothing that doesn't come directly
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.140]   from God's word.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.540]   Like, you and I are to set our expectations biblically,
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.100]   and I mean that with all my heart,
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.740]   that you and I, truly, if you base your expectations on,
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.500]   hey, God's gonna give me a long life,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.860]   God's gonna give me kids that know him, or kids at all,
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.100]   or a husband, or a wife, or any of that stuff,
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.060]   you are setting yourself up for frustration,
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.180]   for disappointment.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:20.380]   And you are entitled, and reflecting that entitlement.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.260]   The God who's there says, man, inside of this life,
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.220]   here's what you can expect.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.100]   You wanna expect him, or align your expectations biblically?
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.500]   You can expect you're gonna have trouble
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.520]   inside of this world.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.380]   That's what Jesus promises.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.460]   John chapter 16, looks into his disciples,
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.280]   says, hey, I'm gonna go, prepare a place,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.260]   we're gonna be forever together in eternity,
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260]   it's gonna be amazing, but in this world,
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.940]   you're going to have trouble.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.220]   Things are gonna be, it's Jesus' words,
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.700]   like, guys, I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.420]   It's gonna be rough, okay?
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.860]   But I've overcome the world, that's what he says.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.540]   So the expectations that you and I are to have,
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:56.200]   as crazy as that sounds, is that God doesn't owe me anything.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.180]   And when I become more aware of that,
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.660]   it begins to allow me to be more grateful.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.400]   Everything else is just icing on top.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.940]   Another day that I lived, another opportunity
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.380]   where God provided another meal, another opportunity,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.980]   everything else becomes like, man,
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.380]   none of this was promised.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.240]   God, you're so good, thank you.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.060]   Help me to not fall in love with the gifts
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.980]   that you've given, but in love with you more,
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.300]   the giver of those gifts, that we set our expectations
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.240]   of what we deserve, biblically, not socially.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.420]   Socially is what happened in the parable,
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.940]   where they kinda essentially looked around
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.100]   and they're like, look, all my friends
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.340]   or all the other people got this,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.720]   so I think this would be fair,
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.540]   and God, if you don't give it to me, I'm angry at you.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.580]   That's what they did to the landowner, who is God,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.980]   essentially, who represents God inside of the story.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.780]   Tragically, it's just all too common,
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.340]   part of the human experience, where often,
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.180]   the way we determine what we deserve or what is fair
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.780]   is based on what others have, a comparison.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.860]   Even, this happened, even, there's a story in the Bible
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.260]   where the disciples, this happened with Peter and John.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.900]   Peter and John were two of the disciples,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.460]   and Jesus, in John chapter 21, you can read it later,
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.660]   has this conversation with Peter,
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.300]   where he essentially says, Peter,
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.860]   he begins to tell Peter how he's gonna die,
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.580]   and Peter would be crucified upside down,
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.900]   and Jesus kinda tells a, man, here's what's gonna happen,
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.380]   and Peter's gonna willingly die for his faith,
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.140]   and Jesus says, this is what the future holds for you,
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.160]   but don't lose heart and remain faithful,
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.900]   and Peter soaks it all in, and then it says
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.860]   he does what is so easy for any of us to do.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.580]   He's like, it says, literally, the text says,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.220]   and then he looked over and he saw John,
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.820]   and he's like, great, okay, I'm gonna die,
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.920]   crucified upside down.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.740]   What's gonna happen to John?
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.660]   Like, what's the faith that he's gonna have?
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.300]   Are we sure we're handing these out equally?
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.700]   And Jesus looks at him and he says,
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.380]   that's not between you and John, or me and you,
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.300]   that's between me and John.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.700]   Like, if I, and it says, if I want John to live forever,
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.140]   that's for me, between me and John,
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.340]   and the text is so funny 'cause it literally says,
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.940]   and from that day forward, a rumor went around
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.580]   with people saying that John would live forever,
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.220]   but it didn't say that John would live forever,
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.540]   is what it says there.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.740]   If you knew your Bible, that would be funny, okay?
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.660]   But Jesus says to Peter what I think he would say
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.820]   to all of us, hey, your faith is between me and you.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.180]   The hand that I deal to someone else
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.180]   is not between you and me and them,
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.420]   it's between me and them.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.120]   This is between me and you, Peter.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.820]   Don't base your expectations on what life has for you
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.500]   based on what others have, but based on what the Bible says.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.540]   And to this landowner, he says, man, you're grumbling,
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.620]   you're angry at me, all based on your expectations
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.300]   of what you deserve, entitlement.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.340]   And then he goes on to how entitlement really costs us,
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.560]   and here's what happens next inside of the story.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.820]   Verse 11, when they received it, that's the denarius,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.420]   they began to grumble or be indignant against the landowner.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.100]   And they said, these who were hired last
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.820]   worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.560]   who've borne the burden of work.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.060]   We work 12, and we were in the heat of the day.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.700]   The word there is like super hyperbolic language,
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.260]   or hyperbole, the heat of the day
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.140]   is essentially other translations
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.520]   or other places it's used is like set on fire.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.460]   They're essentially like, look,
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.320]   we've been out here for 12 hours,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.820]   it's like Houston in the summertime out here,
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.100]   we're burning up, I got sunburn all over me,
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.940]   you know how hot it is in the middle of the desert,
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.700]   and you made them equal to us?
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.940]   And they're angry at the landowner.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.100]   They do what entitlement does to any of our hearts,
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.500]   it begins to move us in the direction
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.700]   of being angry or bitter towards other people
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.300]   because entitlement, our second point,
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.740]   entitlement poisons relationships.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.540]   It always poisons relationships.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.580]   It poisoned their relationship with the landowner,
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.540]   likely their relationship with the other five o'clock people
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.620]   who they weren't happy for, they were like,
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.040]   oh man, I can't believe this person,
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.900]   how do you think that walk home win?
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.340]   I mean, imagine had no entitlement
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.420]   been a part of this conversation,
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.260]   or no entitlement been in the hearts
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.460]   of the people who worked all day long.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.940]   Imagine that they had just sat there,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.660]   they received their wage, and they were like,
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.780]   oh my God, you just paid us the same
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.980]   as you paid that one hour?
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.780]   This landowner is incredible, look how generous this guy is.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.700]   He paid us 150 bucks, we were here all day,
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.980]   I didn't have a job before this,
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.980]   he came along, he hired me, then he paid these guys,
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.300]   this is the most generous guy ever,
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.660]   I'm gonna work for you for the rest of my life,
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.540]   can I work for you tomorrow?
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.940]   Can't be here till five o'clock,
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.220]   but I'd love to work for you tomorrow.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.500]   I mean, think about how different that would have been.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.820]   And instead, they're like, man, I'm angry at this person
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.700]   because he didn't give me what I think that I deserve
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.620]   because I'm not getting what I think that I deserve
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.420]   because anytime there's entitlement,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.500]   it poisons relationships, and it is poisoning
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.820]   the relationships in your life
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.100]   and the relationships in my life
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.900]   anytime that it intersects with them.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.500]   Because entitlement, it just ruins
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.340]   or affects everything that it touches.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.780]   It's like this, last week I was doing laundry
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.740]   in my house for, I have a wife and a two-year-old,
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.940]   and so doing laundry, just being dad of the year,
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.820]   husband of the year, I think I'm nominated
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.260]   for both right now, and, (audience laughing)
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.140]   self-nominated, self-nominated.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.460]   But I'm going through, I'm doing laundry, this is great,
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.220]   and cleaning up the house, spring cleaning,
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.780]   getting all the Christmas stuff cleaned up,
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.820]   and I noticed that there's, around our Christmas tree
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.980]   that we had taken out, there was this thing
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.020]   called a tree skirt.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.540]   What's a tree skirt?
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.020]   It's something, it's like a hat towel or a blanket
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.620]   you put at the bottom of a tree.
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:28.140]   I don't know, it's, keep moving.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.380]   Anyways, it's this big red tree skirt,
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.660]   and so I was like, I'm gonna take that,
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.340]   wash that too, throw all the laundry together,
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.280]   and so I throw that in with the rest of the laundry.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:42.740]   And, (laughing) man, everyone saw where this was going
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.140]   but me. (audience laughing)
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.740]   And so I'm doing the laundry, this is great,
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.800]   and my wife, I had to go off, I don't even know where.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.660]   At some point, I left, and she fielded the laundry
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.940]   out of the washer, and she says,
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.340]   "Hey, did you put the tree skirt in
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.820]   "with the rest of the clothes?"
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.400]   Yeah, husband of the year, that's what I do.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.520]   Because all of our clothes are now pink.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.440]   My favorite shirt I got at Christmas is pink.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.300]   Our towels are all pink.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.420]   Everything that it touched was this lovely shade of pink.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.020]   This shirt was bright white last week, now it's pink.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.300]   That's not true.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.860]   But everything that it touched was this shade of pink
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.860]   because it bled onto everything that it was around,
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.940]   entitlement, anything that it touches, it ruins,
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.480]   it affects, it poisons, and particularly
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.860]   as it relates to relationships.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.680]   What do I mean by how can it poison relationships?
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.980]   Think about how entitlement has impacted
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.020]   and is impacting your friendships.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.980]   And you can see this easier on the other side,
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.740]   like when you're friends with someone who's entitled
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.660]   who gets really angry that you didn't text them back
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.660]   because after only 30 minutes, they're like,
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.140]   really, 30 minutes later, are you kidding me?
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.100]   Life has moved on, I'm done with that.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.260]   I mean, think about it.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.460]   You can see how it impacts, like,
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.060]   you didn't come to my birthday party.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.640]   You showed up late or you came for the very end.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.540]   You missed that dinner that I had with all those people.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.380]   You can see how it impacts and it erodes
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.980]   relationships and friendships at work.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.500]   Entitlement, I mean, it'll mess your ability
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.780]   to work as a follower of Jesus, which is like,
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.580]   hey, I'm gonna faithfully serve, not my boss,
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.260]   but I'm gonna work as though I'm working for God,
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.180]   not for man.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.700]   If you feel like your boss is not treating,
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.540]   if you feel entitled to be treated differently
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.100]   than your boss is treating you,
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.820]   I mean, it'll impact your dating relationships.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.660]   Golly, please, listen up.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.420]   If you're dating or if you ever want to date someday,
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.920]   if you date, so you do not wanna marry someone
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   who's entitled, I mean, it is a horrible thing
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.340]   to step into a covenant with a person
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.260]   who has a certain expectation on where you're gonna live,
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.660]   what car she's gonna drive or he's gonna drive,
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.460]   what type of vacation they're gonna go on,
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.600]   just all the different ways that they expect to be treated
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.260]   and it is a very different thing to step into
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.300]   a relationship with someone who has no sense of entitlement.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.360]   They're just grateful that you're there.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.620]   They're grateful to be in this with you.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.900]   They're not like, oh man, I can't believe
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.780]   that we're going back to Mexico.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.660]   I always wanna go on vacation to Hawaii.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.620]   We always end up in Mexico.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.700]   They're just like, I can't believe we're going to Mexico.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.780]   This is unbelievable.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.740]   That's a very different reality
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.900]   and that's a reality you want, I promise.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.640]   And it's not a reality that a lot of people have.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.800]   If you pick up on entitlement, you need to jump ship now
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.140]   and I mean that sincerely and you should do it
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.600]   with a kind heart and sit them down and talk through
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.340]   why you don't see the relationship moving forward
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.380]   but it is deadly and if you begin to pick up on entitlement,
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.220]   it will make a miserable marriage.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.400]   Entitlement will also impact your,
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.980]   and this is really common with young adults,
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.720]   their relationship to the church.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.740]   I mean because they think entitlement is often
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.940]   at the foundation of how we decide on what church
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.020]   we're gonna be a part of and where we're gonna go.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.220]   I mean think about the ways that you hear people
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.820]   talk about church and this is for people
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.020]   who maybe have been in church for a while.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.060]   If you've been running with us for a while,
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.920]   you grew up in church, you'll hear people say things like,
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.460]   look, I'm just looking for the place where I get fed.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.780]   Like in other words, I'm looking for a place
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.340]   where I'm entitled to that and then we'll say things like,
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.580]   I just feel like I'm gonna go here for a while
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.120]   because I wanna do a deep dive on the Old Testament.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.260]   I don't feel like we're doing enough of that
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.580]   or Leviticus or Revelation.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.300]   Will somebody tell me what's going on in Revelation?
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.500]   And we'll talk through, like hey, I'm entitled
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.040]   to go into a place where I feel fed
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.580]   and if you're not feeding me, then I'm outta here.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.980]   I mean we had a guy come and visit our staff
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.000]   a couple weeks ago who joined us for what we call
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.740]   staff prayer but he was another pastor
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.460]   and he said, you know what's going on right now
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.740]   inside of our country?
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.500]   There's this epidemic of spiritual narcissism
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.620]   and I heard that and I was like, ah,
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.780]   I bet I know what he means, like just selfishness.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.820]   And he said, here's what it looks like.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.740]   People have the expectation,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.940]   they put an expectation on their pastor,
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.940]   on their church that was never meant
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.360]   to be put on their pastor.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.640]   It is not the job of a pastor to feed his flock.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.880]   It is the job of a sheep to feed themselves.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.860]   In other words, at the beginning that's fine
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.000]   and if someone grows but the point of Christianity
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.880]   is that you and I and every person who's a believer
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.980]   would get to the place where they can feed themselves.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.340]   As silly as it would be for me to show up at your house
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.420]   because I'm like, look, I'm not sure you can eat on your own
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.820]   let's get some applesauce here.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.260]   That's as silly as it is for people to show up
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.620]   years and years and years, sometimes decades
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.420]   and expect that man, if I'm ever gonna get fed,
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.620]   it's your job, your job is to learn how to feed yourself.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.620]   And the pastor hopefully is an encouraging part of that
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.280]   but that's where God wants to lead you to.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.780]   And if you find yourself in a place where hey,
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.700]   I'm entitled to be fed when I want, what I want
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.220]   and from who I want, you are a spiritual narcissist
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.820]   and you're not gonna grow in your faith
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.100]   or your faith is gonna be stunted.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.980]   Honestly, we see this a lot of times at the porch
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.380]   where just, this is a plug for one of the girls who runs,
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.740]   who administratively helps us, where people will call in
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.220]   and they feel like entitled to know
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.260]   what the message is about.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.740]   It's insane how like entitled, they're like,
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.120]   yeah, what's the message on tonight?
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.540]   Just wanna know, hey, and we won't tell you, heads up,
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.540]   so you're not ever gonna know.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.420]   If you call in, just save it.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.380]   And they're like, yeah, hey, yeah, I know you won't tell,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.260]   but come on, just tell me what the message is about
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.620]   and I won't tell anybody.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.180]   And we're like, no, we're not actually gonna tell.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.940]   Do you guys even love God over there?
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.540]   Look, I'm just trying to know because I have a friend
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.860]   that I wanna invite to church.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.020]   I'm not sure they're gonna wanna come
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.980]   if we're just talking about anything.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.220]   Hey, I think they're gonna be encouraged.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.260]   Okay, yeah, I'm going somewhere else.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.900]   And it's like, oh my, entitlement.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:42.380]   And it is deadly and it is poisoning
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.660]   and does poison relationships,
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.620]   poisons minds and it poisons yours.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.900]   The opposite is true though for those who are not entitled.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.220]   I mean, their relationships, it's just amazing
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.660]   how different it is when you interact with them.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.620]   We've all interacted with people
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.260]   who really don't have a sense of entitlement.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.820]   I mean, they're like, dude, you missed my birthday?
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.640]   Are you kidding me?
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.900]   You're so busy, don't worry.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.260]   I got birthdays every year, man, literally, they come.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.540]   They'll be another one, it'll be great.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.900]   You missed the next five, who cares?
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.020]   Hopefully I'm around, if not,
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.260]   we'll be together for billions of years.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.400]   And that's amazing.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.300]   And they're just quick to forgive, they're quick to,
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.020]   that's the type of people you wanna be around.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.060]   I mean, how much more attractive even is that
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.940]   in a friendship or a dating relationship?
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.820]   We've said it before, guys,
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.780]   if you wanna be more attractive tomorrow when you wake up,
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.820]   maybe you got hit by the ugly stick on the way out.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.100]   You do not have to be worried.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.540]   You could be more attractive in just a minute.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.140]   I'm gonna give it to you right now.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.300]   (laughing)
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.060]   There's no ugly stick, I apologize.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.220]   (laughing)
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.020]   If you are someone who's grateful, you're not entitled,
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.340]   you're quick to forgive, you will be all of a sudden
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.140]   like more magnetic.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.540]   People will wanna be around you,
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.940]   you'll be more attractive to the world around us,
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.180]   and God wants you to experience that.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.540]   It's a better way to live.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.980]   Free from the poison that entitlement brings
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.180]   to relationships, and finally,
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.660]   we're giving kind of the clearest indicator of the cure,
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.340]   the ongoing cure that we've talked a little bit about
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.660]   already for entitlement, but here's what Jesus says
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.580]   in verse 13.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:21.100]   But he answered them, so they land on a response.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.900]   I am not being unfair to you, friend.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.180]   Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.380]   Take your pay and go.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.820]   I wanna give the one who was hired last
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.300]   the same as I gave you.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.220]   Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money,
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.340]   or are you envious because I am generous?
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.380]   So the last will be first, and the first will be last.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.060]   Excuse me.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.860]   I wanna reread the line, are you envious
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.460]   because I'm generous, because inside of it
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.460]   there's something really significant taking place.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.440]   Your translation may have, or is your eye evil?
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.980]   Neither of which is great.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.140]   Essentially what the original language says
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.140]   is is your eye bad because I'm so good?
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.080]   In other words, are you gonna allow the goodness
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.620]   of the landowner to lead you to be angry at the landowner,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.100]   to lead you to be angry at other people,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.580]   and angry at the world around you?
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.760]   Or are you gonna be grateful to just the goodness
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.500]   of the landowner and the gifts that he's given to you,
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.180]   or to the payment, to what he's given to you?
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.780]   The third idea from this text is that entitlement ends
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.380]   where gratitude begins.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.980]   And I know that sounds like just a pithy line,
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.300]   and oh yeah, that's great, I'll tweet that.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.020]   Entitlement, truly, it ends where gratitude begins.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.060]   That their response would have been radically different
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:40.100]   than just said, man, this landowner is incredibly good.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.020]   How amazing is this guy?
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.740]   In the same way that our response, entitlement ends
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.920]   when we just look at God and go,
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.060]   God, you're so good to me inside of my life.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.780]   I'm just overwhelmed with all the ways
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.660]   that I wanna thank you.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.580]   The scripture says that everything good inside of your life
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.800]   and inside of my life comes down
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.580]   from the heavenly Father of lights, James chapter one.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.060]   It says that everything good in your life and in my life
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.780]   is a gift from God himself.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.600]   And you might be thinking like,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.300]   man, do I really have like a ton to be thankful for?
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.100]   Do I really have a ton that I should be,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.860]   have an attitude where I'm just grateful?
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.500]   I mean, think about the last 24 hours of your life.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.640]   I mean, think about all, and if you're like,
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.940]   yeah, it's been really hard, honestly.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.920]   I don't love my job that much.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.580]   The internet's out at our apartment, and I'm,
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.260]   I mean, think about like even the fact
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.860]   that many of you drove a car into work here.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.700]   Many of you today, you had heat inside of your office
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.540]   building or inside of the home that you live in,
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.300]   and there's all kinds of different things that had you.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.920]   If we could trade places with the King of England
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.120]   200 years ago, he would be like,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.840]   oh my gosh, I would give anything to experience
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.240]   the life that you guys live.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.320]   With the touch of a button,
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.200]   you can access endless information of the world around you
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.960]   and answers to any question you may have.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.000]   You can push a dial and it controls the environment
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.720]   or the heat inside of a room.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.840]   For many people, you guys walked across the parking lot
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.080]   and you're like, yeah, it was really far.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.760]   You have legs that move.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.880]   Think about how many people inside of the world
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.640]   would just say, gosh, I would love to be able
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.720]   to have the health to walk that distance again.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.440]   There's a video that a church did over the holiday season
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.720]   that just captured, honestly,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.520]   the power of just the attitude of thankfulness
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.400]   and how much we take for granted.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.880]   And the guys are gonna throw it at a church
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.200]   out of North Carolina, and they just displayed as well
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.160]   as really I could say it.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.460]   So you guys watch this.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.600]   I'm alive.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   I'm alive.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:40.760]   Hey, Christine, you're here too.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.640]   I love you.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.480]   - I know.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   - Dad, what's happening?
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.160]   - Honey, the power works.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.200]   It's going, it goes on and off whenever we want.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   We've got clean water.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.200]   - That's great, look at that.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   - Ooh, I bet I know what this does.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.720]   - Rain down the glorious water.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.360]   - Ha, shoes.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.940]   Oh, what do we got here, guys?
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.800]   Food.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.640]   - Mm, I love food.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.220]   What, a toothpaste?
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.280]   We might have work.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.880]   This is awesome.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.800]   Come on, let's get here.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.960]   - Hey, the what?
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.120]   - Doug, be careful.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.800]   - Ooh, I have a car.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.480]   Did you guys see this?
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.800]   - Yeah, you have a car.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.640]   - A car.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.480]   - A car.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.520]   (laughing)
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.080]   - And don't forget your coffee.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.440]   - You're the best.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.640]   (laughing)
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.440]   - Oh, man.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.840]   I love it.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.640]   Our parking team is right now wrapping
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.320]   every single one of your cars in the parking lot,
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.160]   just to show you.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.480]   (laughing)
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.400]   What if they were?
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.000]   Can't believe we have to do this.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.840]   I mean, it's a silly video, but it's powerful.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.600]   You think about, man, just all the things
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.040]   that we take for granted that our heart
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   immediately doesn't go, gosh, man, I'm overwhelmed.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.360]   Lord, thank you for the gifts inside of my life.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.160]   I mean, it's just such a better way to live
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.600]   when you allow your heart to continue.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.360]   There's something that happens inside of my heart
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.600]   when I spend time just thanking God
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.160]   for the things that he's given me inside of my life,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.440]   even especially maybe when I allow circumstances
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.560]   where I'm like, gosh, my car just broke down,
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.800]   and I, in healthy moments, just go,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.120]   Lord, thank you for a car that can break down.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.280]   Less than 1% of the world even owns a car,
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.560]   and I have a car, so thank you that I even have a car
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.400]   that can break down.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.480]   Lord, thank you that I have a sore throat,
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.280]   because it reminds me, sickness can remind me
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.960]   of how good it is to not be sick and to be healthy
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.480]   and how often that is the case.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.520]   There's just something, it's a better way to live.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.120]   And people who embrace just this attitude of,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.360]   Lord, I'm gonna be grateful,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.140]   and they practice gratitude towards God
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.180]   and gratefulness towards others,
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.080]   they're like, it's hard to get those people bogged down.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.520]   Their life is filled with more joy.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.720]   If you wanna have more joy,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.040]   and I'm gonna give you practical things,
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.680]   or two practical things that I want you to do,
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.960]   begin to practice thanking God
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.480]   for the things inside of your life.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.800]   I mean, it just does something to our heart.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.360]   It tunes our heart.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.240]   And it moves us more towards worshiping God.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.780]   Inside of our house, one of the most common ways
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.880]   that we pray at our family dinner tables,
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.760]   we say five things we're thankful for.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.600]   That's how we're gonna pray.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.740]   Five things, go.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.740]   Men, water, the dog, a wife that is just incredible.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.760]   Lord, thank you for food, thank you for Jesus.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.120]   And it does something to your heart.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.380]   If you wanna have more joy tomorrow,
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.900]   practice thanking God, thanking others.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.200]   If you wanna be depressed, continue to be entitled
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.140]   and think that everything that you have inside of your life,
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.060]   you earned, you're owed, you deserve.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.240]   Practically last week, we said,
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.360]   hey, we're gonna invite you, if you want to,
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.440]   for the next 30 days.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.080]   Hey, wake up 30 minutes early with us.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.580]   You can go to jointhejourney.com
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.080]   and join us in kind of this Devo that we're doing,
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.920]   where we're just waking up,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.800]   studying God's word for our staff.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.640]   We do Join the Journey,
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   but whatever that looks like for you,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.480]   and we invited you to, hey, wake up 30 minutes earlier.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.360]   Now, as an add-on to that,
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.500]   here's something you can add on to it.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.280]   Begin your time of studying God's word
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.320]   by just writing out or just praying out
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.560]   five things I'm thankful for.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.600]   God, thank you for this.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.360]   It does something in the inside of your heart.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.120]   And it moves you in the direction of the person
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.200]   that you want to be, of a life that's more filled with joy.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.880]   And so we wanna invite you, five things.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.280]   As you begin, do 100 things.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.600]   Do it, and there's no cap on it,
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.640]   but begin recognizing, Lord, thank you.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.120]   Thank you for a season of singleness,
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   even if I don't want it,
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.200]   where I can just further use my time
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.400]   to serve the people in the world around you
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.320]   and to grow in my love and knowledge,
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.400]   my relationship with my heavenly Father,
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.840]   to grow in my faith.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.200]   Whatever those things are,
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.860]   and when you begin to turn what feel like obstacles
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.740]   or challenges, and you flip 'em by thanking God
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.680]   for just whatever's inside of your life, it does something.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.600]   Some of you, you need to leave here tonight,
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.120]   and you need to reach out and you need to thank somebody.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.000]   Like someone, your boss, someone that you work with,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.280]   a family member, that there's just little things
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.440]   inside of your life where you need to reach out
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.280]   and send a text.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.480]   Imagine if 3,500, or between everyone involved,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.800]   5,000 people tonight just sent a text to someone,
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.720]   hey, I'm just thanking God for you tonight.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.160]   I'm just thankful for whatever it is inside of you.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.980]   Because here's what's crazy about gratefulness
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.320]   and thankfulness to one another.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.740]   When someone doesn't thank you,
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.000]   like not expressed gratitude,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.800]   we've all been on the other side of it, right?
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.480]   Like when you do something really hard
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.700]   and they don't thank you,
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.920]   even if they feel thankful inside of their heart,
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   if they don't express it or communicate it, what happens?
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.340]   It's received as they're ungrateful.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.060]   I mean, think about that.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.360]   That anytime you and I withhold thankfulness
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.840]   towards another person, it is received as ingratitude.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.160]   It's not just received as, hey, kinda neutral.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.400]   It's if I work really hard and I plan something for you
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.960]   or I give something to you and you don't say thank you,
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.240]   I'm not like, oh man, it's neutral.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.600]   It's received as they're ungrateful.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.920]   They don't care.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.220]   Some of you, best thing that you need to do
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.600]   is you need to reach out, thank a parent,
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.720]   thank the boss that you work with.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.240]   Thank your community group, and you're like,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.160]   oh, they don't need to be thanked,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.980]   that's just a part of being in community.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.720]   Those are especially the people that you need to thank.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.600]   And it does something to you and it does something to me,
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.800]   and I have a hunch that when the body of Christ,
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.760]   and maybe we'll just start here,
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.960]   inside of this room and in Fort Worth
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.160]   and wherever you're listening in,
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.520]   if we unleash on the world just waves and waves
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.380]   of young adults who are filled with not entitlement,
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.640]   like the world around us says, but just gratitude,
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.920]   they can't get bogged down based on circumstances.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.660]   They're grateful to God to have another day
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.760]   that they weren't promised.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.320]   It is powerful, and that's what we're gonna do in this city.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.520]   That's what we hope to see experienced inside of this room,
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.400]   and that's what we hope to experience inside of our own life
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.180]   and it only benefits you.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.280]   The final reason why entitlement,
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.880]   and I'll land the plan in quotes here, is so dangerous
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.720]   is because it will not just cost you joy or relationships,
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.060]   it will cost you heaven.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.840]   Like if you are not able to get over
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.180]   just an entitlement attitude towards God,
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.640]   it will cost you eternal life.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.680]   Here's what I mean by that,
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.440]   and I think this is way more prevalent than you think,
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.040]   'cause you're like, who's entitled towards God?
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.320]   The most common belief in the country, I think,
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   maybe in the world, is rooted in an entitlement towards God.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.780]   What do I mean by that?
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.040]   The most common expression,
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.840]   outside of what the Bible teaches,
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.560]   that maybe if you lumped
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.320]   kind of the major world religions together,
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.440]   people would think, hey, when it comes to me
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.880]   having eternal life with God,
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.200]   if I'm gonna be in heaven or not,
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.080]   it is all based on how good of a person
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.160]   that I think that I am,
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.040]   and if I'm good, I think I deserve heaven.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.720]   If that is your attitude,
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.320]   like I have a good heart,
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.140]   and I've done good things,
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.160]   and I try to live a good life,
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.760]   you are entitled towards God,
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.920]   you are not a Christian,
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.400]   you don't know what the Bible teaches,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.280]   or at least you're not believing what the Bible teaches.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.920]   The message of Christianity is not that,
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.800]   hey, if you try and you're a good person,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.680]   then you have eternal life.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.900]   I was talking to a friend last week,
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.920]   and we were talking through just faith,
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.120]   and I asked him the two questions,
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   or these two questions of,
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.560]   man, if something happened to you today,
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.680]   like you died, and hopefully that doesn't happen,
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.160]   but if it happened, on a scale of one to 10,
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.200]   how confident are you that you would go to heaven?
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.040]   And he said, you know,
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.200]   I think I'm probably like an eight or a nine.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.820]   And I said, why?
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.600]   And he said, because I have a good heart.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.700]   Like I've always had a good heart,
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.840]   like I look back, and I've always,
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.040]   you know, I've always wanted to help people,
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.320]   I've got a heart to help people,
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.360]   you know, if somebody was in need,
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.720]   I would give them my last $15,
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.680]   I would give them whatever they needed,
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.640]   you know, like I've always had a heart to care for people,
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.420]   and I had to look him in the eyes and say,
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.560]   you're not a Christian.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.280]   That's not the message of Christianity.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.040]   And we walked through that the message of Christianity
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.060]   is not that, man, I'm a good person, so I deserve God,
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.160]   I am entitled to heaven because of me.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.040]   The message of Christianity is that
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.120]   I'm not entitled to anything but hell.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.380]   But the God who is there loved me so much
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.500]   that he died in my place, he made a way for me.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.720]   And that anyone who doesn't say,
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.160]   look, I'm entitled, and I'm gonna try,
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.120]   and I'm gonna work really hard,
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.060]   but anyone who says, I've come to the place
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.220]   where I know that I can't save myself,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.720]   I'm not deserving of a relationship with you, God.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.220]   You're perfect, you're holy, you're sinless.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.060]   You're everything that I wish that I was, but I'm not.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.520]   And if the basis for me ever getting to heaven
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.120]   is gonna be based on I have a good heart,
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.760]   and I've tried really hard, and I pay my taxes,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.200]   and I go to church, I'm never going to get there
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.680]   according to Jesus, according to the Bible.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.120]   And if that's what you believe right now,
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.280]   the God who is there has brought you sovereignly
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.120]   into this room, and into the room in Fort Worth,
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.560]   and into the room in El Paso, in Tulsa,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   everywhere that you are, listen to me very closely.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.660]   If that is what you believe,
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.640]   the God who's there has sovereignly brought you.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.480]   He wove the pieces, he had a friend invite you,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.740]   he brought you into this room right now
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.060]   for the moment that you could hear
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.260]   the message of Christianity is not work your way to God,
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.600]   it is God has worked his way for you,
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.040]   and died in your place on the cross.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.280]   And if you will accept the free gift,
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.160]   what does it mean to accept,
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.240]   what does it mean to have a gift?
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   It means that you're not deserving of it.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.720]   If you deserve it, that's called a payment.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.680]   It's a gift, if you will accept,
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.560]   not by what you do, but by his grace,
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.100]   or just by faith in what he did.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.400]   I'm trusting, God, you paid for my sin.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.260]   Every time I've smoked marijuana,
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.620]   every look at pornography I've done,
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.280]   every time that I was in that affair,
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.640]   every action of anger,
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.520]   every time that I've gotten hammered on the weekend,
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.260]   or hammered last night, you paid for it.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.620]   And if I'm gonna have a relationship with you,
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.040]   it's gonna not be because I deserve it, 'cause I don't.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.560]   That person, Jesus says,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.120]   whoever comes to the end of themselves,
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   they can have the gift.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.840]   If they'll just say, God, I accept it.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.400]   The God who's there is crazy about you,
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.120]   loves you enough to die in your place,
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.420]   I'll give my life for you.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:21.240]   So that you would be brought into his family,
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.600]   not because you deserve it,
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.720]   but despite the fact that you didn't,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.520]   and I didn't, being entitled.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.320]   Will rob you of joy, it'll kill your relationships.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:38.320]   And it will keep you out of heaven,
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.080]   but it doesn't have to.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.080]   If you'll accept freely what Jesus did for you,
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.480]   like so many of us have.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.640]   Let me pray.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.160]   Father, thank you.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.480]   Seems like
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.300]   embarrassingly small.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:09.580]   To say to the God who created the universe,
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:13.500]   who's perfect and holy,
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.960]   who's righteous in every single way,
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.240]   worthy of every worship,
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.160]   worthy of every breath that any of us breathes in here,
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.000]   and yet you would decide,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.160]   because of your love for us,
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.140]   that you would become a man,
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.920]   enter into our world, die for our sins,
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:39.800]   despite the fact that we're entitled, angry, addicts.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.480]   Father, I pray for anyone inside of this room
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.040]   who's never stepped into a relationship with a God
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.360]   who wants to know them,
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.000]   and is so reckless in his love
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.120]   that he'll kick down any door for them to know it,
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.880]   that tonight you would break the walls of entitlement down,
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.720]   that they would be exposed to the lie.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:04.580]   They don't deserve heaven, and neither do I.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:10.040]   But the one who did, Jesus,
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.240]   gave his life so that they could experience heaven.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.440]   Father, would you kill the entitlement in our hearts?
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.280]   Would you breed gratitude in us?
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.840]   Would we be a thankful people?
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.960]   Would we see all the incredible gifts that you give us?
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.220]   And Lord, should you give us another day?
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.440]   Would we wake up tomorrow with hearts full of worship
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.400]   and gratitude towards you, our King?
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.640]   Thank you, Lord, for the million things
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.880]   I take for granted every single day,
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.960]   and thank you most of all for sending your Son,
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.640]   for me, for my friends, for anyone who will accept it.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.460]   Amen.
