1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,600
 - All right, let's go.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,620
 Hey, welcome friends in the room,

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,720
 friends in El Paso, Fort Worth, Dallas,

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,040
 excited Front Row, Houston, Rogers, Arkansas,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,240
 wherever you were tuning in and joining us from,

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,400
 we are excited to continue this series.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,580
 Hey, any fans of the show "Tidying Up" right now?

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,700
 Man, I love it.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,300
 Yeah, Marie Kondo.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,120
 So for those of you who've never heard about it,

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,780
 let me tell a story that'll give us some direction

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,780
 for where we're going tonight.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,680
 A friend of mine recently suggested that,

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,660
 a girl who works on staff, she was like,

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,340
 "Hey, you guys need to watch this show."

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,640
 And was telling us about it.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,080
 It's essentially, it's like the reverse of "Hoarders."

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,960
 If you've ever seen "Hoarders," this is a show,

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,120
 "Hoarders" where you like keep everything,

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,760
 this is a show where the woman goes into your house,

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,420
 basically helps you kind of like,

23
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,240
 "Hey, let's get rid of this stuff."

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 And it's got like a cult following right now around it.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,760
 To the point where if you are watching it,

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,600
 you're probably like,

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
 "That's not exactly what the show's about."

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,880
 And, but it pretty much is.

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,920
 And so I was like, "Yeah, okay, we need a new show.

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
 We'll watch that, turn it on."

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,400
 Let me give you a couple interesting facts

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,280
 in case you ever go watch it.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,960
 Number one, Marie only speaks Japanese,

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,980
 which is interesting and was a curve ball.

35
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,840
 So she's in America and she goes around

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,360
 and she's like basically with her translator,

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,880
 she's telling you, "Hey, this is what you need to do.

38
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,280
 Take these things out, move these."

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
 And she's got all these different step-by-step things

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
 to clean up your house.

41
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,960
 And I can't exactly endorse it or any of it,

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,080
 but I was a little bit surprised, like just funny things.

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
 Like you talk to the clothes.

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,320
 You're like, "Thank you for what you were a part of my life

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
 in this season."

46
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,380
 And the way you evaluate whether you want to keep

47
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,920
 different clothes or items is like,

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,480
 "Hey, does this thing bring you joy or spark joy?

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,480
 Or is this something that is a part of my past?

50
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,960
 Or do I want this to come into the future?"

51
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,480
 So we were like, "Hey, one thing it does definitely do

52
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,920
 is it gets you in kind of the spring cleaning kick."

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,120
 So of course my wife and I began to go through things

54
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,360
 and immediately recognized how many things we have,

55
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,160
 either that we didn't know that we have,

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,980
 or how many things that we were holding onto from the past

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,640
 that probably had no place in our future.

58
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,240
 For example, cargo shorts,

59
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,040
 probably not something anybody needs to hold onto.

60
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,960
 So I'm like going through and I'm like,

61
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,880
 I mean, really you've got to realize how much you have.

62
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,620
 I had a pair of binoculars that I've had since 15.

63
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,600
 I've never used them,

64
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,000
 but you kind of always hold onto stuff

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,480
 'cause you're like, "Well, what if I take up

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,840
 birdwatching someday?

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
 Or I'm going to need these."

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,320
 Or, you know, going through old clothes

69
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,140
 and it's like pearl snaps, this probably has to go.

70
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,000
 Or just things that no longer fit anymore.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,580
 And so it was a revelation to us of just how many things

72
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,540
 from our past that we were still holding onto

73
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,160
 that we didn't realize we were carrying

74
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,440
 into our future unknowingly.

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,380
 And what does that have to do

76
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,000
 with what we're talking about tonight?

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,160
 We're continuing a series called Self-Care,

78
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,700
 where we explore what the Bible says

79
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,420
 about caring for yourself.

80
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,460
 Self-care is a cultural term right now that's popular

81
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,980
 and related to, you know, people under the banner

82
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,400
 of self-care will do all kinds of things,

83
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,360
 whether it is participate in retail therapy,

84
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,620
 or, "Hey, I just need to go to the mall

85
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,680
 'cause it's been a hard week."

86
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,620
 Or, "I need a margarita."

87
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,180
 Or, "Hey, I need to go on a diet."

88
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,260
 It's kind of like anything that you want

89
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,460
 that you think would be good for you

90
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,740
 fits into the bucket of self-care.

91
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,080
 That's what the world says.

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,120
 But biblically, self-care is not like that,

93
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,080
 but there is things that God says,

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,800
 in order for you to be a healthy person

95
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,220
 in mind, body, and spirit,

96
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,900
 these are things that should mark your life.

97
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,320
 So we've been exploring that

98
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,380
 and are spending the next really handful of weeks

99
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
 exploring what does it look like in 2019

100
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,260
 for you to be all that God wants for you to be,

101
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,360
 for you to experience increased health

102
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,500
 as it relates to your mind, as it relates to your body,

103
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
 as it relates to your spirit.

104
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,180
 And tonight, we are gonna talk through

105
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,540
 the idea of cleaning out the closet,

106
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,260
 if you will, of your soul.

107
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,380
 Because just like in that scenario,

108
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,100
 where there's things inside of our closet

109
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,080
 that we stumble across and we're like,

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,420
 "Man, I didn't realize I still had this from high school

111
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,660
 that we're carrying around."

112
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,260
 There are things in all of our lives

113
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,540
 that if you don't intentionally go through your life,

114
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,360
 you didn't just pick up that shirt from high school

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
 you're still carrying around,

116
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,500
 you picked up wounds and hurts

117
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,740
 from that friend who betrayed you in high school

118
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,140
 that you're still carrying around.

119
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,100
 And not just hurts, there's also just habits,

120
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,120
 or we call them hangups, or sins,

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,240
 that at some point along our journey in life,

122
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,220
 all of us are either exposed to

123
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,620
 or sins committed against us.

124
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,700
 And if we're not diligent to clean those things out,

125
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,940
 to work through those, we will carry those items

126
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,060
 or those things from our past into the future.

127
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,180
 It looks like being exposed to pornography

128
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,660
 in the seventh grade, and all of a sudden,

129
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,860
 that begins to feed something, and you carried it.

130
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,100
 Maybe you're still carrying it.

131
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,220
 It looks like being sexually abused,

132
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,740
 and just kind of along the journey of life,

133
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,620
 and it wasn't your fault, and somebody made a decision,

134
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,060
 and it was wrong, and it was evil.

135
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,980
 But if you and I are not careful to deal with the hurts

136
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,780
 and things done to us and things that we've done,

137
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,780
 you're gonna carry those items into your future,

138
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,580
 whether you want to or not.

139
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,180
 And so tonight, we're gonna discuss what it looks like

140
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,100
 to diligently clean out the closet, if you will,

141
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,580
 of your soul, to make sure that you're not carrying things

142
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,100
 from your past into the future,

143
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,720
 because if you do not deal with that,

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,140
 if you don't deal with hurts, sins,

145
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,420
 and things from your past in the present,

146
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,340
 you will carry them into the future.

147
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,860
 It is a guarantee.

148
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,740
 And so we're gonna look at what God's Word says

149
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,820
 about how we can experience freedom

150
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,740
 from some of the hurts and sins that have marked our life.

151
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,020
 So we're gonna look at three principles.

152
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,340
 If you take notes, you can label this talk

153
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,620
 cleaning out the closet,

154
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,860
 or cleaning out the closet of your soul.

155
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,260
 We're gonna look at three principles

156
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,920
 and three practical things from God's Word.

157
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,220
 Three principles as it relates to experiencing

158
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,180
 a healthier you at a spiritual level,

159
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,860
 and three practical steps in light of those three principles.

160
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,700
 So we're gonna dive right in.

161
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,780
 The first principle that we're gonna look at

162
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,980
 comes from Proverbs 28.

163
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,620
 It's really all throughout the Bible.

164
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,820
 But Proverbs 28, verse 13, it says this.

165
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,820
 "Whoever conceals or hides their sins does not prosper,

166
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,700
 "but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy."

167
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,300
 The first idea that Solomon tells us in Proverbs 28, 13

168
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,580
 is repeated all throughout the Bible,

169
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,420
 which is essentially whatever we conceal will not heal.

170
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,340
 That way that I said it was,

171
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,340
 hey, the principle is that God cannot heal

172
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,260
 whatever we hide.

173
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,200
 There are things in your life,

174
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,720
 some in the present, some in the past,

175
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,940
 and if you are hiding them,

176
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,300
 you are basically saying,

177
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,620
 God, I do not want you to heal this arena of my life.

178
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,660
 Some of you are carrying around

179
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,100
 a secret addiction to pornography,

180
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,260
 and you would say it's not an addiction,

181
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,740
 but I pretty much look at it every day,

182
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,060
 and you will not be healed

183
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,420
 as long as you hide or conceal that.

184
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,300
 Some of you are carrying an eating disorder,

185
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,020
 and no one knows, and you're committed to no one knows.

186
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,700
 And you think, man, I'm probably just gonna die

187
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,460
 with this, I don't know that I could tell anyone.

188
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,740
 Others of you, there was sexual abuse in your past.

189
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,340
 Maybe you carry the shame of an abortion.

190
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,180
 I don't know what it is for you, but I do know

191
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,880
 the Bible says whatever you hide, God cannot heal.

192
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,740
 That whatever we decide to hide or conceal from Him

193
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,540
 is something we are saying,

194
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,860
 God, I do not give you access to healing this.

195
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,740
 You're carrying an addiction to drugs or pain medication,

196
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,180
 and you're doing it all alone,

197
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,420
 and you're afraid, what if other people knew?

198
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,780
 And there's an enemy called Satan who is feeding you

199
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,140
 the lie that you can't tell anybody,

200
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,240
 you need to fight or you need to suffer in isolation alone.

201
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,400
 Because if people really knew the real you,

202
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,860
 they'd reject the real you, and it's a lie.

203
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,600
 And the God who's there says, I'm inviting you

204
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,820
 to experience the cure, which we already read,

205
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,140
 but as James says further to punctuate it,

206
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,200
 is this, is confession.

207
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
 He says this in James 5, verse 16.

208
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,520
 Therefore, confess your sins to each other

209
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,960
 and pray for one another so that you may be healed.

210
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
 The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.

211
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,180
 That the Bible teaches that the solution,

212
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,240
 that the cure, the first step in cleaning out

213
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,440
 the closet or the soul in your life involves confession.

214
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,800
 Because whatever the principle is,

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,360
 whatever you hide, God cannot heal.

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
 And as long as you keep that a secret,

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
 you will hide or you will not experience

218
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,060
 the healing of God in your life.

219
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,700
 But if you will confess it, which means what?

220
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,600
 Not talking just to God, it says confessing to one another.

221
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,920
 It means talking to people, bringing it out into the light.

222
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,720
 God says that along with prayer,

223
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,480
 you will begin to experience the cure,

224
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,040
 that confession is the cure.

225
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
 And he's inviting you, if you wanna experience healing,

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
 it's not gonna happen the day that you wake up

227
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,200
 and you're like, I just don't wanna be depressed anymore.

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,860
 The first step is when you begin to expose it to the light,

229
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,120
 you begin to bring it into the light with other people,

230
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,640
 other believers or Christians inside of your life.

231
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,220
 But as long as you hide it,

232
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,060
 you delay healing in that area.

233
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,320
 I have a friend who, when I went to college,

234
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,760
 we one day went out to this lake

235
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,080
 that was called Lake Bryan, which is near College Station.

236
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
 And, you know, whoop.

237
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,280
 And we were out there and hanging out for the day

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,520
 and he had to go to the bathroom.

239
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,800
 And we were kinda out of this like lake park

240
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,240
 and there wasn't really bathrooms around.

241
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,780
 And so he was like, hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom

242
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,560
 over here, went out into the woods

243
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
 and he didn't have to go number one.

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
 So you may see where this is going.

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,760
 And so he goes and he, you know, uses leaves.

246
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,400
 And then later that night, you know,

247
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,160
 kinda everything's fine, go back to the day

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
 and go home and he was a roommate.

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,760
 Or we lived in the same house.

250
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,840
 And that night he woke up and he was covered

251
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,600
 in a poison oak rash.

252
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
 (congregation laughing)

253
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,040
 Yeah.

254
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,800
 I know, man.

255
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,380
 And here's the fun fact about poison oak

256
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,320
 and poison ivy, in case this is just free.

257
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,120
 In order for it to heal, it has to be exposed to the light

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
 and out in the open.

259
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,280
 And the longer that it is covered up with clothes,

260
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,760
 it will not heal.

261
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,880
 And so that's a really tricky area.

262
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,800
 He's essentially wearing a diaper of poison oak around him.

263
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,440
 And that's a really tricky area to keep out in the open

264
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,160
 'cause we are not on National Geographic in Africa

265
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,000
 or something.

266
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
 And so what does that mean?

267
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 It means that for weeks, he had a poison oak rash

268
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,400
 that covered him where he would essentially go to class

269
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,660
 and then he would come home and he would take a bath

270
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,800
 because whatever you hide cannot heal

271
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,440
 or delays the healing in there.

272
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,840
 And that guy was this guy.

273
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,040
 And, I know.

274
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,680
 Just didn't want us to go there.

275
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,600
 Still don't.

276
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,640
 But I learned a valuable lesson

277
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,680
 as I experienced this firsthand,

278
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,480
 that if you don't expose to the light and to the open,

279
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,920
 poison oak, it, like sin, is not going away

280
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,840
 and will not heal.

281
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,720
 And here's where this really is true for you.

282
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,800
 If you do not expose the areas of your life

283
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,760
 where you are struggling,

284
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,880
 you are going to not heal from them.

285
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,400
 You will not.

286
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,280
 If you don't have other people

287
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,560
 that you are opening up your mouth and honestly saying,

288
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,840
 hey, this is the area where I'm really struggling right now.

289
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,960
 I don't know what it is in your life.

290
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,680
 Maybe it's anxiety.

291
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,780
 And whether or not anxiety is a sin or directly

292
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,160
 or what does that look like, it's a part of a fallen world.

293
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,440
 And I do know you weren't meant to walk alone

294
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,140
 in the midst of that anxiety.

295
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,640
 And there is an enemy who wants to tell you the lie

296
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,920
 that you can't tell anybody this.

297
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
 You're the only one who has same sex attraction.

298
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
 You're the only person here that had an abortion.

299
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,480
 If they really knew what you, who you really are,

300
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,000
 they wouldn't even let you in here.

301
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,920
 And it's a lie.

302
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,680
 Feeds you lies like, man, what are they gonna think

303
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,880
 if I tell them?

304
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,440
 Let me tell you what they're gonna think.

305
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,940
 If you come and you open up about, man,

306
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,160
 this part of my life, here's what they're gonna think.

307
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,720
 You're really honest and you're a lot like them,

308
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,680
 only more honest.

309
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,940
 That's what they're gonna think.

310
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,000
 That all of us come into this room and we're all broken

311
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,280
 and we all have problems.

312
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,320
 And if you walked into this room

313
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,000
 and everyone looks pretty like they have it all together,

314
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,880
 we're all on a journey here.

315
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,000
 Nobody, hey, I just woke up like this.

316
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
 That doesn't exist in the church.

317
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
 And if the body of Christ can't be open

318
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 about the areas where we are struggling,

319
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
 what group on the planet can?

320
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
 And so here's the invitation.

321
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,280
 If you wanna experience healing

322
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,520
 or cleaning out at a soul level,

323
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,120
 if you wanna be all that God wants for you to be,

324
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,280
 not just today, but going forward,

325
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,480
 you have got to tell someone.

326
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,860
 And so tonight, grab a trusted Christian.

327
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,900
 Grab someone that you believe.

328
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
 Sometimes I feel like we're like,

329
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,440
 hey, you gotta live openly and we give the impression

330
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,520
 that, hey, here's what we want you to do.

331
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,400
 Every one of you line up, we're all going up on stage,

332
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,280
 you gotta tell everybody everything.

333
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,320
 That's not what I'm saying.

334
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,820
 I'm inviting you, tell one person.

335
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,160
 Start there.

336
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
 Share with your community group.

337
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,000
 That would be awesome.

338
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,320
 But if you're like, that's too much for me,

339
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
 take a baby step.

340
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,560
 I dare you, tell one person.

341
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,720
 Tell a trusted believer.

342
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,080
 If you're like, I don't know any trusted followers of Jesus,

343
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,800
 we'll have an entire team up down front after this message

344
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,520
 that would love to come alongside and pray for you.

345
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,460
 And you're like, what are they gonna think if I share that?

346
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,680
 They're gonna think you're honest

347
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,080
 and you actually want to get well.

348
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,480
 That's what they're gonna think.

349
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,640
 And the God who's there is crazy about you.

350
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,060
 He loves you so much that he would give his own life for you

351
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,320
 and there's an enemy who's telling you,

352
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,240
 you need to carry this alone and he's saying, I love you.

353
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,840
 I want you to experience healing,

354
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,920
 not 'cause I'm angry at you, because I love you.

355
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
 And the choice is yours.

356
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,600
 Are you gonna experience or allow the only cure

357
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,560
 that we're told, prayer and confession,

358
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,520
 from another person to come into your life

359
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,960
 to breathe and begin to breathe healing

360
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,480
 or are you gonna hold it alone and just let it grow

361
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,880
 because what you hide does not heal

362
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,040
 and what we hide, God cannot heal.

363
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,000
 So the first principle is what we hide, God can't heal

364
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,280
 and the first practical is that you've got to reveal.

365
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,760
 All the practicals come with an R,

366
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,920
 so this should be really easy tonight.

367
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
 You've got to reveal it.

368
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,380
 You've got to reveal it to someone else in your life.

369
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,600
 This changed my life.

370
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,680
 I remember in college, around that same time,

371
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,600
 there was a guy who came in and busted into my house

372
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,560
 and he basically said, hey, take this phone.

373
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
 I did it again, I looked at pornography

374
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,200
 and I don't want to be this man anymore

375
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,300
 and I'd never seen someone be that honest.

376
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,400
 And you know what I did?

377
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,440
 I slammed the door and said, get out of here.

378
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,560
 No, of course I didn't do that.

379
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,660
 That was entirely a joke.

380
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,600
 I said, oh my gosh, me too.

381
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,440
 And I don't wanna be this man

382
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,560
 and it was the very first time

383
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,360
 that I began to experience healing around pornography

384
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,380
 because confession is not just a cure, it's contagious.

385
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,560
 And when we open up our lives,

386
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,320
 it breathes health not just into us but others around us.

387
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,440
 So the first thing, the first principle

388
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,520
 and the first practical that we're given is reveal

389
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,280
 because what we hide cannot be healed.

390
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,920
 Second principle that we see laid out in scripture

391
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,600
 comes from Hebrews chapter 12.

392
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
 It really comes from all over the place

393
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,200
 but we'll dive in from Hebrews chapter 12, verse 15.

394
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,120
 It says this, see to it that no one falls short

395
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,840
 of the grace of God and that no bitter root

396
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,000
 or the root of bitterness, your translation may have,

397
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,780
 grows up and causes trouble and defiles many.

398
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:34,240
 That the writer of Hebrews says, see to it

399
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,560
 that in your lives you do not have a root of bitterness.

400
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,640
 Begin to grow.

401
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,000
 Here's what I love about the analogy, it's brilliant.

402
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,420
 What's a root?

403
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,820
 It's something that's below the surface that you can't see

404
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,920
 but it's impacting what's on the surface.

405
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,880
 Some of you are carrying around a root of bitterness

406
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,960
 and no one can tell and you got a great smile

407
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,080
 and you have it all together but you are harboring anger

408
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,360
 and it is impacting what's on the surface.

409
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,220
 And it is gonna impact the future relationships

410
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,800
 that you have.

411
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 So it's not just evaluating and confessing sins

412
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
 and revealing sins inside of our lives to one another.

413
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,000
 The second principle is really around hurts

414
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,620
 and that's this, that we have to stop holding onto hurts

415
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,680
 that hold you back.

416
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,900
 That there are things in this room that are scars

417
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,220
 that are being carried and you are holding onto hurts

418
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,860
 from a friend who betrayed you, from a parent who walked out,

419
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,940
 from someone who abused you, from someone who hurt you,

420
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,700
 from a coworker who lied about you.

421
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,740
 And that root is beginning to grow and it is not going away

422
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,280
 and it will have consequences.

423
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,100
 How do I know if I have a root of bitterness growing?

424
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,500
 Let me give you a couple lists of questions.

425
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,140
 I think these will be on the screen.

426
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,900
 If it's not already obvious to you,

427
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,180
 if man, I'm angry at this person and until they own it,

428
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,080
 I'm not forgiving them.

429
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,500
 Here's how else you might know.

430
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,540
 Is there anyone in my life that part of me hopes

431
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,780
 they fail or suffer?

432
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,340
 I would be excited about it if things fell apart for them.

433
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,980
 The root of bitterness has grown.

434
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,860
 Is there anyone whose name, when it's just brought up,

435
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,440
 it makes me angry or brings bitterness to mind?

436
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,140
 Is there anyone that I'd avoid in public

437
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,900
 because of something that happened between us?

438
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,280
 If I saw them, I would try to go out of my way

439
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,500
 to avoid them or not let them see me

440
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,940
 because of what they did.

441
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,180
 Is there anyone that you are waiting to let into your life

442
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,400
 until they apologize?

443
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,980
 The root of bitterness is growing.

444
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,260
 Whenever I was engaged to my wife,

445
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,740
 we were going through premarital counseling

446
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,620
 and the pastor was gonna marry us.

447
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,060
 My wife's parents had been divorced

448
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,700
 but she had just had some past hurts from her dad.

449
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,340
 He said, "Have you forgiven your dad?"

450
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,460
 And she said, "There hasn't been a specific time

451
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,860
 "that I can remember."

452
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,060
 And he says, "I can't marry you until you deal with that

453
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,500
 "because if you can't learn to forgive someone

454
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,640
 "when they deeply hurt you, you are not ready for marriage.

455
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,980
 "Marriage is one call to forgive someone

456
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,660
 "who deeply hurts you over and over and over again.

457
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,500
 "And if you can't do that,

458
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,620
 "if you're storing up bitterness already,

459
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,340
 "you're not gonna be prepared to step into marriage."

460
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,500
 I mean, really candidly, let me tell you the truth.

461
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,740
 That's what marriage is,

462
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,980
 is the call to forgive someone who deeply hurts you

463
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,460
 over and over and over again.

464
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,500
 And I'm not talking about abuse.

465
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,260
 I'm saying that's just what even healthy marriages are.

466
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,500
 And if you can't and haven't forgiven,

467
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,060
 if you're carrying around bitterness now,

468
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,800
 what makes you think you're gonna be the type of person

469
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,660
 who gets rid of bitterness later?

470
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,420
 You're gonna store it up and store it up and store it up.

471
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,260
 So I can't marry you.

472
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,780
 If you're dating someone in the room

473
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,260
 and they haven't walked through the process

474
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,580
 of forgiving a family member or they're carrying bitterness,

475
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,120
 you should be concerned

476
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,140
 because they're gonna carry bitterness against that person,

477
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,300
 which means they're gonna carry bitterness against you.

478
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,040
 And that root, though it's below the surface,

479
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,300
 will continue to grow and impact what is on the surface.

480
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,540
 And so you should be concerned if you're dating someone

481
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,140
 who is not forgiving someone inside of their past.

482
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,740
 There was a, in the 1940s, World War II happened.

483
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,100
 And all over Germany,

484
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,180
 there were thousands of bombs that were dropped,

485
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,140
 thousands of them.

486
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,180
 So in the midst of World War II, the Allies flew over

487
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,420
 and they're trying to take down Germany.

488
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,180
 Thousands and thousands of bombs were dropped.

489
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
 Thousands of them did not go off.

490
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,740
 They're there to this day.

491
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,260
 All over, in other words, all over Germany,

492
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,740
 there's cities that there were these bombs that dropped

493
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,580
 and they never went off,

494
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,540
 maybe 'cause the fuse or something was wrong with them.

495
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,260
 And every now and then, they'll find them.

496
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,100
 And you know what happens?

497
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,700
 Oftentimes it happens whenever new construction

498
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,540
 is coming in and they're like,

499
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,180
 "We're putting in a McDonald's over here

500
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,100
 "and sick of the bratwurst, here we go."

501
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,260
 And they'll begin to dig and they find a bomb.

502
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,680
 And you know what they do?

503
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,980
 They gotta evacuate the entire city.

504
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,620
 And they get everyone out and then they try

505
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,740
 to defuse the bomb.

506
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,700
 And if they can't defuse it, they have to just set it off

507
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,440
 'cause they know that, hey, this thing may not go off today

508
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,140
 or tomorrow, but it's a danger to anyone who's around it.

509
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,860
 So it is with hurts inside of your life.

510
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,100
 If you store anger, if you don't deal with them,

511
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,900
 it is like a bomb and it's not gonna go off maybe today,

512
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,920
 maybe tomorrow, but it's not going away.

513
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,020
 And it is a danger to every relationship

514
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,120
 and person around you.

515
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,860
 And so the question is, man, how do you defuse past hurts?

516
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,320
 The Bible says it's through the process of forgiveness

517
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,380
 or the second practical is releasing them.

518
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,260
 That's what forgiveness is, it's releasing.

519
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,000
 The Bible in Colossians chapter three, verse 13 says this,

520
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,500
 "Bear with each other and forgive one another."

521
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,820
 If any of you has a grievance or anyone holds a grudge

522
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,460
 against someone, forgive them.

523
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,860
 Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

524
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,780
 What is forgiveness?

525
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,220
 It is releasing justice to God

526
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,540
 for the hurt someone else did.

527
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,440
 Hey God, I'm trusting you with that.

528
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,480
 I'm releasing all of that to you, God.

529
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,760
 You're the God who will avenge any wrongs

530
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,600
 that were done to me.

531
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
 Every sin committed against me will be paid for

532
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,420
 either by them in all of eternity

533
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,860
 or was paid for on the cross.

534
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,700
 And so I am releasing that to you, God.

535
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,540
 I am choosing to forgive this person.

536
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,240
 If you wanna experience freedom from the hurts

537
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,940
 that are gonna hold you back,

538
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,720
 that are gonna hinder your relationships,

539
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,380
 it is gonna involve forgiveness.

540
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,220
 What is forgiveness?

541
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,740
 It is releasing justice to God

542
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,420
 for the hurts that were committed against you.

543
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,220
 I'm not choosing to hold that against them

544
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
 and I'm releasing that and trusting it with you, God.

545
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,420
 Forgiveness is not forgetting.

546
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,720
 In order to even forgive someone,

547
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,920
 you can't just forget and act like,

548
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,760
 oh, it never happened.

549
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,140
 It's saying, I see the inexcusable.

550
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,560
 What you did was wrong and I'm not excusing that sin

551
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,920
 and it was hurtful and it was painful

552
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,440
 and I'm choosing that I will not hold that against you.

553
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,400
 I'm releasing that to God

554
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
 and I will trust him with the outcome.

555
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,420
 I'll trust him with whatever vengeance

556
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,960
 or restitution needs to take place.

557
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,240
 That's ultimately in his hands, not mine.

558
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,960
 I'm choosing not, hold that.

559
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,200
 Forgiving is not excusing sin.

560
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,020
 It's not pretending like it didn't hurt

561
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,720
 or like you're not angry about it.

562
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,400
 Sin should make you angry and sin does hurt.

563
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,960
 Sin makes God angry and it grieves the heart of God.

564
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,120
 Of course, that's a natural response.

565
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,480
 So it's not saying, oh, it never hurt.

566
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,680
 Fine, everything's good.

567
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,880
 It is choosing.

568
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,600
 Despite that, I'm releasing that to you, God.

569
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 I'm trusting.

570
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
 I'm not gonna continue to hold onto this

571
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,680
 and carry it with me.

572
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,520
 And also, it is not optional.

573
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
 That as a believer, it is God's call

574
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
 that you are required to forgive

575
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,800
 as he has forgiven the inexcusable in your life.

576
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,660
 And finally, it's not conditional.

577
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
 I think the most common thing that I'll hear is,

578
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,100
 hey, man, if they will own their part,

579
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,400
 if they would come and apologize,

580
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,560
 they don't even think they did anything wrong.

581
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,880
 They're all defensive and they're like,

582
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,560
 man, if he comes and begs for my forgiveness,

583
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,400
 then I'll give it to him.

584
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,280
 But until then, I'm not gonna just empower

585
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,480
 and entitle him there.

586
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,120
 The Bible says forgiveness is not conditional.

587
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,920
 It's not a, hey, once they do this,

588
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,160
 then I will forgive them.

589
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,680
 It is a call to release to God.

590
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,000
 Hey, I'm trusting you with those things.

591
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,700
 I'm not gonna hold them against them,

592
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,200
 just like you, God, didn't hold my sin against me.

593
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,680
 And tragically, as long as you hold onto those things,

594
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,580
 and if you're waiting for someone to come apologize

595
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,680
 or own their part or make it up to you,

596
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,960
 you're holding onto a hurt

597
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,600
 that is only gonna hold you back.

598
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,280
 I was talking with Josh who leads out in Fort Worth,

599
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,480
 and we were talking this past week,

600
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,920
 and he grew up out in the country,

601
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,720
 and he was telling about raccoons that would come

602
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
 and try to kill chickens.

603
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,400
 And so the way that they would trap these raccoons

604
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,160
 is they would drill a hole into the side of a tree or a log

605
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,200
 and kind of make a trap,

606
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,360
 and they would put a shiny object in the hole.

607
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,920
 And then you put these screws around the hole

608
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,140
 so they could reach their hand in

609
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,240
 to grab the shiny object,

610
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,200
 but if they made a fist, they couldn't get out.

611
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,040
 And though at any point,

612
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,880
 they could just release the shiny object and go,

613
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,920
 it never comes into their mind,

614
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,160
 'cause they're like, no, I have to hold onto this thing.

615
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,520
 And they don't realize that their freedom

616
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,280
 is within their hands if they'll just let it go.

617
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,700
 In the same way, there is a freedom

618
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,420
 that God wants you to experience,

619
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,360
 but as long as you hold onto hurts

620
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,320
 or hold onto requiring they come do something,

621
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,260
 they make it up, they own their part,

622
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,160
 they need to apologize,

623
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,480
 you are holding onto the shiny object,

624
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,700
 and you are holding yourself back

625
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,600
 from experiencing the freedom God wants you to experience.

626
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,520
 From no longer being owned by a bitterness that's there,

627
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,480
 and he's inviting you, will you release that?

628
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,540
 Will you trust that to me?

629
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,100
 Every sin will be paid for.

630
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,840
 It has been paid for on the cross,

631
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,600
 or it will be paid for in all of eternity by them.

632
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,680
 Will you release that?

633
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,720
 And in doing so, you'll experience freedom.

634
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,380
 Part of the reason maybe some of us in this room

635
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,820
 struggle with forgiveness is we think about,

636
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,020
 man, the hardest thing is to forgive myself.

637
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,200
 I can't forgive myself for what I did.

638
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,040
 And the bad news is you can't forgive yourself.

639
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,440
 But you can accept God's forgiveness.

640
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,480
 That's what the Bible teaches.

641
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
 The Bible doesn't teach that, hey,

642
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,560
 you just need to forgive yourself.

643
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,200
 The Bible teaches that you need to accept

644
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,640
 God's forgiveness over your life.

645
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
 That's what it means to be a Christian.

646
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,660
 In other words, to be a Christian,

647
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,500
 in case this is new,

648
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,840
 maybe you're back in church for the first time,

649
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
 a Christian is someone who says,

650
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,820
 I am not trusting in my behavior,

651
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,220
 how good of a person I am, the things that I've done,

652
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,740
 how many Bible verses that I know,

653
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,180
 how many times I go to church.

654
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,580
 That won't get me into heaven,

655
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,540
 and it won't allow me to have a relationship with God.

656
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,260
 A Christian says, despite everything good I do

657
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,020
 or everything bad that I've done,

658
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,620
 the only way that I can have a relationship with God

659
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,940
 and experience eternal life in heaven

660
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,020
 is by trusting in Jesus and what he did on the cross,

661
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,500
 paying for my sin, dying in my place, and rising again.

662
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,420
 He died the death I deserve

663
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,120
 so that I could live the life

664
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,040
 that I cannot live without him.

665
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,480
 That is what it means to be a Christian,

666
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,240
 is essentially, God, I'm choosing to accept him.

667
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,360
 I'm accepting your forgiveness,

668
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,540
 not 'cause I earned it, not 'cause I deserve it,

669
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,000
 but because you offered it to me.

670
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,060
 When you gave me your life,

671
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,540
 that's the only way I can have eternal life.

672
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,340
 That's what it means to be a Christian.

673
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,040
 And the truth of the matter is,

674
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,880
 if you're saying, man,

675
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
 I just can't get over forgiving myself,

676
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,840
 you're holding a higher standard than God is.

677
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,020
 And you're also belittling the work that he did

678
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,660
 through Jesus on the cross.

679
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,900
 And the option of the action you need to take

680
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,160
 is not choosing to forgive yourself,

681
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,240
 it's choosing to accept God's forgiveness

682
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,540
 despite the fact that you do not deserve it.

683
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,560
 So the second R that comes from here is release.

684
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,640
 Release, the practical of, hey man,

685
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,480
 stop holding onto hurts that are gonna hold you back.

686
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,380
 You've got to release them through forgiving.

687
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,000
 You've got to make the decision, I choose to forgive you.

688
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,480
 I remember one of the most powerful things

689
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,520
 that really I think marked my 20s

690
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,060
 was a moment where I had to do this myself.

691
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,680
 I had to sit down and I had to make the decision

692
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,980
 that I had to forgive my dad.

693
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,140
 I was raised by a single mom,

694
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,460
 and I've shared about that,

695
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,380
 and my dad was really absent, he wasn't around.

696
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,180
 And the times that he was around, it's just not great.

697
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,080
 And we'd see him every other week on a Monday night.

698
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,940
 And I realized there were some things in my heart

699
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,080
 that I was just holding onto bitterness,

700
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,740
 and I had to go, and I had to,

701
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,420
 for me, I had to go write it down,

702
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,100
 and I had to choose and make the decision to forgive.

703
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,860
 And say, man, you took from me a dad

704
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,380
 who was present in my life,

705
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,140
 and I'm choosing to forgive you.

706
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,080
 You took from me every other Monday night

707
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,900
 where I had to drive across town to that tiny apartment,

708
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,780
 and I'm choosing to forgive.

709
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,640
 You took from me a father who would attend sporting events,

710
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,020
 a father who was present,

711
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,780
 who actually knew anything about his son.

712
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,860
 You took that from me.

713
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
 I didn't get to have that because of you.

714
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,100
 And I'm choosing to forgive you and release it.

715
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,580
 Ultimately, it's a sin against God,

716
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,900
 but I'm not gonna carry that anymore.

717
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,420
 And every time that in my life I find a new hurt

718
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,740
 or a new thing that I'm like, man, I feel like I'm bitter,

719
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,940
 I find a new balm.

720
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,580
 I gotta go in and I have to diffuse it

721
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,980
 through forgiveness and make the decision.

722
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,640
 I'm not holding that against them.

723
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
 I'm releasing that, God.

724
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,440
 I'm trusting that with you.

725
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,880
 The third principle, really, that we see

726
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,560
 is found in Mark chapter five

727
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,960
 and the story of a man who was demon-possessed.

728
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,240
 It was a guy that Jesus shows up,

729
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,160
 and I'll kind of set up the scene

730
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,040
 and we'll get the third principle and then practical.

731
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,800
 Where Jesus shows up, he's kind of going around,

732
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,360
 he's on the scene, he's doing miracles,

733
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,160
 and he goes and he finds this guy

734
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,680
 who we're told is demon-possessed.

735
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,700
 He's just kind of crazy.

736
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,880
 He lives all by himself.

737
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,440
 It says he lives in a graveyard,

738
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,480
 and he's cutting himself and he's not wearing clothes,

739
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,320
 and he's just like Crazy Carl.

740
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,020
 And everyone knew Crazy Carl.

741
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,240
 You don't go near that graveyard

742
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,040
 'cause Crazy Carl's over there.

743
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,180
 And Jesus shows up, he goes right up to the man,

744
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,200
 and he heals him.

745
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,800
 And this man, it says, is now clothed in his right mind,

746
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,240
 sitting at Jesus' feet, and he's totally changed,

747
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,520
 and all of a sudden the town is coming up,

748
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,080
 and they're like, what happened to Crazy Carl?

749
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,680
 And that's not in the Bible or his name.

750
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,000
 But he was crazy, and Jesus healed him.

751
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,800
 And it says that Jesus then went to go on

752
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,440
 and to go to another town, and here's what happened.

753
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,080
 As Jesus was getting into the boat,

754
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,920
 the man who had been possessed with demons

755
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,600
 begged Jesus, him, that he might be with him,

756
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,200
 or that he might come with him.

757
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,320
 But Jesus did not permit him, but he said to him,

758
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,680
 go home to your friends and tell them

759
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,020
 how much the Lord has done for you,

760
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,140
 how he has had mercy on you.

761
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,200
 And he went away and he began to proclaim

762
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
 in the Decapolis, which is just the city,

763
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,920
 how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.

764
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,840
 Jesus said, don't come with me.

765
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,160
 How crazy is that?

766
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,360
 This dude is like, hey, I wanna be the 13th disciple.

767
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,200
 Can I come?

768
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,680
 And Jesus says, no, I want you to stay here,

769
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,120
 and I want you to go and tell people

770
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,200
 everything that I've done in your life.

771
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,360
 Go home and tell your friends

772
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,640
 about the power of God at work in your life.

773
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,600
 The third idea, really, that I hope,

774
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,480
 as clearly as I can, and I don't know if I do,

775
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,440
 justice to this.

776
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,340
 The third principle is that there is no past in here

777
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,420
 that cannot be a platform for God's power

778
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,820
 if you will let him.

779
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,060
 I don't know what your story is,

780
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,020
 I don't know what you've done,

781
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,060
 I don't know where you are right now,

782
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,100
 I don't know what you did today,

783
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,680
 but I do know this, that if you will allow God

784
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,780
 to come into your life and bring healing there,

785
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,340
 there's no person who has committed sins and offenses

786
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,980
 and done such things that God can't be incredible

787
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,980
 or God can't write an incredible story through your life

788
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,640
 and he wants to write an incredible story

789
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,600
 through your life that you cannot be a platform

790
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,440
 for the power of God.

791
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,680
 What do I mean by platform?

792
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,960
 I mean someone who surrenders and God says,

793
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,560
 man, look, all these different things that I've done.

794
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,200
 I'm a serial adulterer, I slept with a married woman.

795
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,440
 I've been dealing drugs, I've been,

796
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,560
 I don't know what your story is.

797
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,320
 Maybe it's an eating disorder that you've carried,

798
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,160
 whatever those different,

799
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,200
 maybe it was sexual abuse that was done to you,

800
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,280
 maybe you're in a homosexual relationship right now.

801
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,180
 None of those things makes you anything less

802
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,520
 than the perfect candidate for someone that God

803
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,380
 will write an incredible story if you allow him to.

804
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,840
 And that story will be a platform.

805
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,760
 What do I mean by platform?

806
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,280
 A platform is something that you stand on

807
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,040
 and in doing so, it displays to others.

808
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,520
 It allows others to more effectively see.

809
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,480
 In other words, this is a platform.

810
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,880
 When I step down here on the ground,

811
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,280
 you cannot as effectively see.

812
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,040
 If you're listening or looking on the camera,

813
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,260
 you can no longer effectively see me as well,

814
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,720
 but if you will allow God to come into your life,

815
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,560
 and take your story, and take whatever ashes you have,

816
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,720
 he will turn them into beauty.

817
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,600
 Take a garment of heaviness

818
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,240
 and make it a garment of praise, he says.

819
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,160
 And he will put you, and your story will not become

820
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,920
 something in your past that you're embarrassed and ashamed,

821
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,280
 and I don't wanna ever talk about it,

822
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,720
 but it will be something that is a display

823
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,840
 where others can see and they go, oh my gosh,

824
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,940
 God has gotta be behind that,

825
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,240
 'cause that doesn't make any sense apart from him.

826
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,960
 There's so many different stories that have marked

827
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,200
 the lives inside of this room.

828
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,640
 I mean, that's what the porch is,

829
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,320
 is a bunch of broken people coming together,

830
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,460
 trying to walk with Jesus as best we can,

831
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,680
 and openly be honest about the times where we're not.

832
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,200
 And God, in the midst of doing so,

833
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,640
 writes these incredible stories where you can't help

834
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,100
 but look at them and go, there's gotta be a God.

835
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,680
 That doesn't make any sense apart from him.

836
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
 Let me give you a few examples.

837
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,240
 There's a girl that was in Florida

838
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,680
 a couple of years ago, a few years ago.

839
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,600
 She was working at a club, she was doing bottle service,

840
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,160
 she was living for the weekend,

841
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,560
 and living for the party life.

842
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,400
 All of a sudden, a friend kinda introduced her to the porch,

843
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,160
 she started listening, she started getting plugged

844
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,280
 into a local church there, her life began to change.

845
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,920
 She moved here to serve here.

846
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,940
 And her life radically transformed from this girl

847
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,440
 who was living the party life and doing bottle service

848
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,080
 to now running and really behind everything

849
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,280
 that you see done in terms of social media here.

850
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,240
 That she doesn't spend her life

851
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,200
 trying to get other people drunk,

852
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,440
 she spends her life trying to let people know about Jesus.

853
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,200
 There's another guy who's moved here from Texas Tech,

854
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,400
 was chasing after the corporate ladder of corporate America

855
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,920
 and trying to make a million dollars by the time he's 30,

856
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,320
 living for the weekend, he was still living the frat life.

857
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,100
 God comes into his world, turns it upside down,

858
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,640
 and he's responsible for discipling more of the volunteers

859
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,520
 and people here than anyone else in the last 10 years.

860
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,720
 But God, story after story,

861
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,160
 how do you explain that apart from Jesus?

862
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,920
 And what their life is now, is their past,

863
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,240
 is not something that's like a problem

864
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,760
 or defines them or any of that.

865
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,960
 It is a display of the power of God to change people.

866
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,820
 Whatever your story is, that is what God wants it to be.

867
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,560
 He wants you to tell people how much he's done for you.

868
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,800
 And if you're unwilling to do that,

869
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,880
 or if you're not at a place where you're experiencing

870
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,920
 how much he's done for you,

871
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,480
 that's the invitation to you tonight.

872
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,960
 We allow him to take your past, take your problems,

873
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,600
 and make them a platform for him.

874
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,520
 And the question is, not if he's willing,

875
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,860
 it's if you're willing.

876
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,120
 The third idea is, just the R behind this,

877
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,560
 is recognize that your past can be a platform

878
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,880
 for God's power, a display to the world around us.

879
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:26,800
 And the tragedy is, it's not just that you're risking

880
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,140
 becoming, if you're unwilling to move towards healing,

881
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,760
 you're not just risking becoming who you don't wanna be.

882
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,320
 You are forfeiting becoming the man God wants you to be

883
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,160
 and that you wanna be.

884
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,360
 You are operating at less than 100%.

885
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,200
 What do I mean by that?

886
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
 Like, let me use this example, and do this,

887
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,440
 and then tell a story, and then we'll close.

888
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,640
 This is a vacuum, handheld vacuum.

889
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,920
 And we use it all the time at my house.

890
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,760
 It's great.

891
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,600
 (audience cheering)

892
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,440
 Black and Decker.

893
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,560
 And it's not the best vacuum of all time,

894
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,520
 but it gets the job done.

895
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,080
 Here's where it doesn't get the job done.

896
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,920
 We'll be vacuuming along.

897
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,960
 This is not a very big opening.

898
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,040
 So all of a sudden, kids and little kids

899
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,960
 and kids and different things get picked up.

900
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,200
 Something gets lodged in there.

901
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,120
 You know what happens when something gets lodged in here?

902
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,880
 All of a sudden, the effectiveness of the vacuum

903
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 goes from 100%, 'cause it had entire opening up,

904
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
 to less than 100%.

905
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,740
 And so it's no longer oping as effective

906
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,460
 as it would have been.

907
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,920
 Do you know what else is interesting that happens

908
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,080
 when something gets lodged in here?

909
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,300
 It makes it more susceptible to other things

910
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,800
 getting lodged in there.

911
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,940
 Like, all of a sudden, it's like, boom,

912
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,020
 it's kinda clogged up, and more things get stopped in there

913
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,680
 that wouldn't have even gotten stopped

914
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,440
 had there not been something lodged in there already.

915
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,320
 This is how your soul works.

916
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,520
 You'll be going along through life,

917
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,360
 and all of a sudden, something will get lodged.

918
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,000
 Maybe you were exposed to pornography.

919
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,100
 A friend betrayed you.

920
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,080
 A girlfriend cheated on you.

921
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,800
 All of a sudden, something gets lodged in there,

922
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,700
 and if you're not diligent to deal with it,

923
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,680
 it's not going away, and you will be walking with a limp.

924
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,320
 You're not operating at 100%,

925
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,100
 and you will have a more likelihood

926
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,920
 of other things getting lodged in your soul.

927
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
 What do I mean by that?

928
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,440
 If you don't deal with the different hurts

929
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,520
 that pop up in your life, like, let's take pornography.

930
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,480
 If it gets lodged inside of there,

931
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,240
 you're gonna be more likely to have other secret addictions

932
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,080
 and other things begin to spread.

933
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,600
 You're gonna be more likely, not just that,

934
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,460
 for also things just coming out.

935
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,520
 Like, if you're looking at porn in the room,

936
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,040
 it's coming out of the woodworks for you.

937
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,000
 Every girl that you look at,

938
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,280
 you struggle to not try to undress her with your eyes

939
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,920
 or wonder what underwear she has on,

940
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,000
 because it got lodged,

941
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,080
 and other things are starting to stick.

942
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,720
 Maybe there's a hurt from your past,

943
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,600
 and if you don't deal with it and get rid,

944
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,800
 remove that thing,

945
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,120
 that offense that took place,

946
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,000
 you will be more easily offended all the time.

947
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,280
 And so that one big hurt of that friend who betrayed you,

948
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,560
 all of a sudden, you're so easily offended

949
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,920
 that if somebody doesn't follow you on Instagram,

950
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,960
 you're like, oh my gosh, what is wrong with her?

951
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,540
 I'm unfollowing her, that's what I'm doing,

952
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,720
 because something got lodged, you didn't deal with it,

953
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,320
 and now little things are beginning to stick.

954
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,720
 That's who you are becoming.

955
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,280
 And the only way for you to experience healing,

956
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,400
 whether it's a hurt or a sin hangup,

957
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,600
 is for you to reveal and bring others in,

958
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
 for you to release the hurts from your life

959
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,360
 and allow God to be the one

960
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,840
 who administers justice for those things,

961
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,460
 and for you to recognize whatever your story is,

962
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,940
 God wants to use it if you will let him.

963
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,400
 Or you can just let it get lodged.

964
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,280
 No one can tell.

965
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,840
 If something gets stuck in there,

966
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,400
 unless you look inside, it'll turn it on,

967
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,240
 it's really hard to tell.

968
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,660
 So you can continue to coast, no one will know,

969
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,880
 you come here every Tuesday, try to get better,

970
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,180
 and you will suffer in secrecy,

971
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,120
 and that God is there, he's crazy about you,

972
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
 and he's inviting you,

973
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,480
 will you come and experience healing?

974
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,040
 Conclusion, God is calling you,

975
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,160
 that there are areas in all of our lives

976
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,440
 that we have to constantly reveal to others.

977
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,000
 There are hurts that we have to constantly release

978
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,760
 through forgiveness and recognize.

979
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,600
 There's no story that God can't use

980
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,760
 and doesn't want to use if we will let him.

981
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
 Probably the most powerful thing,

982
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,900
 and I'm gonna close here, so I'll land the plane,

983
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,280
 if I haven't been with you, just come back right here,

984
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,520
 stop counting these little wood things

985
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,440
 or any of the stuff on the roof, right here,

986
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,320
 I'm gonna close.

987
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,080
 Here's the most powerful thing in this show

988
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,320
 that I've been watching.

989
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,440
 There's one question, it's actually really helpful.

990
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
 Whenever you get stuck and you're like,

991
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,280
 oh man, should I get rid of this, should I not?

992
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,760
 It's just a single question, it is,

993
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,960
 hey, is this something that I envision

994
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,840
 taking into my future with me,

995
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,520
 that it's a part of my future life,

996
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,320
 or it's something I should leave in the past?

997
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,160
 Why is that helpful?

998
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,840
 'Cause it's like, oh man, look at this Pearl Snap shirt,

999
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,200
 I don't think that I am,

1000
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,860
 I don't think I should bring this into the future.

1001
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,120
 This is no longer in, no offense to Pearl Snaps,

1002
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,800
 they're great, so don't get lost there.

1003
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,140
 But point being, hey, these binoculars,

1004
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,880
 I don't envision my future being like around town

1005
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
 as I think about it.

1006
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,840
 The God who's there is inviting you

1007
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,160
 as it relates to hurts in your life,

1008
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,360
 as it relates to sin habits in your present.

1009
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,680
 Are you willing to allow Him to begin

1010
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,400
 to breathe healing into those things?

1011
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,900
 'Cause the choice is yours, so let me ask it another way.

1012
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,080
 You need to leave here tonight,

1013
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,640
 the question before all of us,

1014
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,960
 is there things that you're holding onto?

1015
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,320
 I don't know what they are, I don't know what they are

1016
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,520
 for you, but the question you need to be asking,

1017
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,720
 is this something I envision in my future

1018
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,960
 or something that I need to let go of from my past?

1019
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,920
 Let me say it another way, let's say you're 22,

1020
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,600
 you're 22 years old in the room,

1021
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
 and you have an eating disorder.

1022
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,120
 I wanna ask you a question.

1023
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,600
 Is that something that you wanna bring into your future?

1024
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,480
 Let's roll forward the clock, 10 years from now,

1025
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,780
 you're 32, coworkers come in, it's your 32-year-old birthday

1026
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,200
 to bring a 32 on the cake, to set it down in front of you.

1027
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,880
 Do you envision having an eating disorder

1028
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,840
 on your 32nd birthday?

1029
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,420
 Is that something you wanna bring in there?

1030
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,200
 Or is it something you wanna let go of from your past?

1031
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,320
 You go, of course I'm not gonna bring it in there.

1032
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,200
 Do you know when you will stop having an eating disorder?

1033
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,200
 When you'll allow others in, when you begin to reveal

1034
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,080
 and experience the cure in your life.

1035
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,440
 Let's play the game another way.

1036
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,560
 You're 25 and you're addicted to pornography.

1037
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,920
 Let's go five years.

1038
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,760
 Like, what do you think about?

1039
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,960
 You're five years, five years down the road,

1040
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,240
 30th birthday, they bring in 30, balloon,

1041
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,320
 a three and a zero, and it's like, happy birthday.

1042
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,220
 The question before you is, is that something

1043
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,560
 you wanna carry into your future?

1044
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,960
 When you envision 30-year-old me,

1045
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,680
 is that something you want to mark your life?

1046
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,320
 Or is that something you need to let go of in the past?

1047
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
 'Cause here's the lie.

1048
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,720
 It's not going away any other way.

1049
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,240
 Not today, not tomorrow, not when you turn 30,

1050
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,480
 not when you get married.

1051
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:38,760
 Maybe you were abused and it was evil and it was wrong

1052
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,760
 and you're not alone and God will have vengeance.

1053
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
 First Thessalonians chapter four says,

1054
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,360
 "He's the avenger of such actions."

1055
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,200
 And you're carrying hurt and you don't trust people anymore.

1056
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,720
 And I just wanna ask you, and you're 24,

1057
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,200
 let's roll forward the clock, you're 40, 16 years.

1058
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,520
 Family gets together,

1059
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
 they got an over the hill party for you.

1060
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,480
 Is that something you envision carrying into your 40s?

1061
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,400
 Are you ready to release it?

1062
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,280
 Because it's not gonna magically happen at some point.

1063
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,640
 It will happen when you choose,

1064
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,560
 God, I'm trusting you with that.

1065
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,800
 I'm letting this go.

1066
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,160
 I don't wanna carry this anymore.

1067
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,760
 I don't want this to mark my life.

1068
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,620
 And the invitation that God of the universe is giving to you

1069
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,880
 is that you can trust me with that.

1070
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,080
 And if you allow me to come in

1071
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,360
 through other people around you

1072
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,280
 and experience what my word wants for you,

1073
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,040
 which is healing, you will have it.

1074
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,960
 Not perfectly and not in a moment,

1075
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,360
 but you will experience the only healing

1076
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,000
 this world has or offers.

1077
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,560
 Or you can hold it.

1078
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,040
 But it's not going away.

1079
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,400
 And the question you need to wrestle the ground,

1080
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,720
 is this something I envision my future with?

1081
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,600
 'Cause it's not going away

1082
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,560
 unless you deal with it in the present.

1083
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,200
 Let me pray.

1084
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,040
 Father, I pray for

1085
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,920
 every person in this room

1086
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,680
 who's hiding

1087
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,080
 that you would in your mercy

1088
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,840
 expose

1089
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,720
 their heart to the things that they've never told anyone.

1090
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,560
 Maybe the parts of their heart

1091
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,280
 they're not even aware of themselves.

1092
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,760
 Maybe things that they have never told anyone.

1093
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,360
 I pray that you would heal.

1094
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:35,200
 I pray for anyone who's ever experienced

1095
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,400
 abuse from another person

1096
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,120
 that they would tonight experience

1097
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,200
 the parts and you would allow them

1098
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,520
 to continue to experience healing.

1099
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,200
 And that story, which is tragic and evil,

1100
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,400
 and it wasn't their fault,

1101
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,960
 would become a platform

1102
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,160
 that shows your power.

1103
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,200
 I pray for the future

1104
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,240
 of the current 23 and 24 and 25 and whatever age

1105
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,160
 that you would help us to be men and women

1106
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,640
 who diligently clean out the parts of our lives

1107
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
 that don't align with you.

1108
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,040
 And that the 30th birthday or the 40th birthday,

1109
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,160
 whatever the future holds for us,

1110
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,000
 we wouldn't be holding onto things

1111
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,720
 that are hurting our soul,

1112
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
 holding us back

1113
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,600
 and hindering us from being a platform for you.

1114
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,240
 We worship you now in song, amen.
