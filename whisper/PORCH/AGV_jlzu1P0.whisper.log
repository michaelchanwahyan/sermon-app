[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:17.820]   - Love it.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.300]   Well, we are continuing through Colossians.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.940]   Anyone Six Flags fans here?
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.400]   There we go, a few of 'em.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.120]   Anyone ever been to Astroworld?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.200]   Ever heard of this?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.120]   There you go, okay, yeah, rest in peace, Astroworld.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.160]   So I grew up in Houston, Texas,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.600]   and me and I had two brothers, there you go,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.680]   a couple of Houston folks.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.320]   Let's just keep playing this game.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.440]   Who likes bread?
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.160]   Okay, so I grew up in Houston, Texas.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.440]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.560]   And me and my brothers would always go to Astroworld
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.720]   at Six Flags, it was like the greatest thing ever.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.120]   We loved roller coasters, it was the thing we wanted to do
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.360]   for every birthday, for every fun event,
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.640]   Astroworld or Six Flags.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.960]   And we would go, and we'd go on these roller coasters,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.760]   and something happens when you go on roller coasters
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.720]   over and over and over again.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.280]   They begin not being quite as exciting
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.680]   as they were the initial time,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.200]   and so in order to make them more fun and more entertaining,
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.480]   we would develop little games to play on the roller coaster.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.840]   And one of the games that we would play
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.040]   would be we would switch shirts
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.280]   with the person sitting next to us on the ride
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.400]   who we always knew and was always a male,
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.360]   and we would sit and we would switch shirts.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.560]   So I'd start with a red shirt,
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.720]   my brothers has a yellow one,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.880]   and we're switching, you and the ride,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.360]   and that's what church kids do for fun.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.800]   So we would play these games,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.520]   and eventually we got to the point where even that
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.760]   was no longer as exciting or as entertaining.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.480]   And so we decided that we would up the ante a little bit,
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.780]   and we would do a full body clothes switch,
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.200]   everything but underwear, shirts, shorts, and shoes.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.120]   Some people are like, oh my gosh.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.200]   Yeah, it was exciting.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.280]   So we planned the whole thing out.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.000]   Of course, it has to be like a roller coaster
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.080]   with at least two flips on it.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.260]   Has to have one of those bars so you can't be buckled in,
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.120]   'cause that would kinda inhibit your ability to change.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.840]   And we had just kind of a system developed
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.560]   to where I would know and I could confirm,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.600]   you had to confirm, do you have the shirt?
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.320]   Because if you don't, it's gone,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.600]   and one of us is leaving here without a shirt.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.240]   So we had a whole thing planned out.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.240]   We were gonna do this.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.080]   We were pumped.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.920]   We thought we could do a full body clothes switch.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.040]   So me and this time it was a friend
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.400]   that I had dragged into doing this with me,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.560]   and we get on the ride, and you couldn't start
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.360]   until click, click, click, click, you're on the descend.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.900]   So we're headed up, click, click, click, and it hits me.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.720]   My clothes are very different than his clothes.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.480]   I'm wearing basketball shorts and a T-shirt,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.880]   and he's wearing jeans and boots
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.120]   for whatever reason to Six Flags.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.520]   And I'm going, oh my gosh,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.860]   I'm working with like two inches of room here.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.760]   How am I gonna be able to pull on jeans and get boots up?
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.080]   And the ride begins.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.280]   And so we're going, we're going through,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.720]   we do the shirt switch through one flip.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.940]   We do the, we begin to do, this is so embarrassing.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.440]   Where am I going with this?
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.200]   We're doing the pants switch, of course,
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.440]   and we're doing it, and so he's got the basketball shorts.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.280]   I've got the jeans.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.560]   Next flip, holding onto the boots and the jeans,
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.840]   trying to pull them up, going around the last turn,
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.680]   trying to get them up,
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.960]   trying to move within the two inches that I have.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.840]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.920]   we're coming down the final stretch and,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.820]   and I didn't make it.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.200]   And so I have to stand up,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.360]   pull my pants up in front of the entire lines
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720]   of everyone at Six Flags,
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.280]   as I walk off, we were like, what kind of ride is this?
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.040]   And so, of course, we went to the kiosk
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.200]   where they take the picture,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.180]   'cause they're like, this is gonna be awesome.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.580]   Where on the ride did this happen?
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.660]   And we go up to the kiosk,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.620]   and you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.980]   There's like little pictures, they take the ride,
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.900]   and they have all the different carts,
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.580]   and you see the pictures.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.580]   And then there's one, one screen that had our picture
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.740]   and, or it had where we should have been,
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.860]   and here's what it was.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.580]   It literally was just that.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.240]   Who even knew they had that on those things?
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.500]   And I go up to the lady, it's like, Shondra,
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.900]   hey, what happened to that one?
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.980]   And she says, inappropriate conduct,
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.620]   indecent exposure, inappropriate dress.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.820]   And I was like, man, there are some bad people in this park.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.100]   Not knowing if she makes a connection,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.120]   hey, do you think I could just see it?
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.440]   Which I'm sure she thought was curious.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.060]   And then eventually she makes a connection,
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.640]   and it's like, you're lucky.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.620]   No, you can't see it, inappropriate conduct,
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.520]   you can't have the picture.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.860]   You're lucky that I don't call the park security on you
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.820]   for indecent exposure.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.180]   And her bottom line was, it was inappropriate dress,
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.700]   inappropriate conduct.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.420]   And the reason I tell you that story,
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.060]   which may seem very random, watch this transition.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.100]   The reason I tell you that story is because tonight,
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.140]   the Apostle Paul is gonna lay out and discuss
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.660]   in the book of Colossians what is appropriate conduct
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.980]   and what is inappropriate conduct
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.740]   within the life of a believer.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.180]   We've been studying the book of Colossians
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.160]   and really for the past few weeks,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.900]   we've gone through the first couple chapters
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.480]   and you may know this already,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.160]   but when Paul writes a letter, typically what he'll do
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.540]   is for the first couple chapters, he will talk doctrine,
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.300]   he will discuss who you are in Christ,
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.500]   he's writing to the church
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.300]   and he'll lay out these doctrinal truths
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.900]   and then he'll get to practical application.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.460]   And tonight, he's gonna go really practical
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.100]   and he's gonna say, this is what the appropriate conduct
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.100]   and appropriate dress for a believer is who's in Christ.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.100]   And not only that, but this is why I think
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.700]   this is such an important message for all of us.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.580]   He lays out how we get there.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.540]   Like he doesn't just say, act this way,
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.960]   he says, let me tell you the path to take
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.220]   to assume this appropriate conduct.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.740]   If you've ever wondered, man, why,
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.260]   if you're a Christian in the room,
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.700]   this is gonna be primarily for you,
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.500]   it may fill in some gaps if you are not a follower of Jesus,
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.020]   but if you're a follower of Jesus and you've ever wondered,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.540]   why do I still do the things that I don't wanna do?
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.860]   I've been given a new nature, I've been made alive,
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.900]   I've been changed, Paul says in these first two chapters,
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.360]   you're totally complete, all these things
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.760]   that sometimes feel so far from me.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.840]   How can I be the person that Christ says that I am?
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.420]   How can I stop doing the things I don't wanna do
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.340]   and do the things I believe are for me to do,
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.420]   what God calls me to do?
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.860]   So tonight, he's not only gonna tell us
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.540]   the appropriate conduct, but lay out for all of us
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.180]   how we get there and you just might be surprised
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.240]   about how we get there.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.120]   But first, so we're gonna pick it up in Colossians 2,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.860]   we're gonna start in verse 16,
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.160]   and then we'll work our way pretty quickly into chapter 3.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.060]   He's gonna start and he's really gonna lay out
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.460]   when it comes to living the Christian life,
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.780]   how you don't do it.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.340]   So he starts there and then he gets to how we do do it.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.820]   So we're gonna pick it up in 16
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.660]   and really, I'm gonna read a paragraph for you
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.820]   that's gonna have all kinds of confusing terms.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.420]   I don't want you to get lost on the terms.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.540]   I'm gonna give you the big picture
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.420]   for the next five sentences, what he says.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.980]   He basically says you don't do it
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.700]   through a bunch of new rules, rules, rules.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.100]   You don't do it through a bunch of new rules,
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.060]   but something else.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.680]   And he lays out a bunch of religious rules
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.620]   that people in the Church of Colossae were saying,
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.380]   this is what it looks like to live the new life.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.380]   This is how you do it.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.020]   And he says, no, that's not it, but here's where we go.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.700]   Verse 16, therefore, after all that we've talked about
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.420]   already, that you're a new creation, you're complete,
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.220]   your sins have totally been paid for,
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.900]   past, present, future, you're made alive.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.620]   Nothing can stop that because of faith in Jesus
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.100]   and what he did, not because of anything you did.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.220]   So here we go.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.400]   Therefore, do not let anyone judge you
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.580]   by what you eat or what you drink
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.020]   or with regard to a religious festival,
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.620]   a new moon celebration or a Sabbath day.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.820]   So don't let anyone look down or judge you
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.900]   for not doing certain religious things.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.100]   These are a shadow of the things that were to come.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.900]   The reality, however, is found in Christ.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.380]   Do not let anyone who delights in false humility
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.340]   and the worship of angels disqualify you.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.680]   Such a person also goes into great detail
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.860]   about what they have seen.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.460]   They are puffed up with idle notions
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.660]   by their unspiritual mind.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.820]   They have lost connection to the head, speaking of Christ,
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.620]   from whom the whole body is supported
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.380]   and held together by its ligaments
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.340]   and sin whose growth as God,
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.100]   grows as God causes it to grow.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.700]   What are we talking about, Paul?
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.620]   Verse 20, since you died with Christ
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.980]   to the element of spiritual forces of this world,
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.340]   why then do you act as though you still belong to the world?
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.620]   Do you still submit to its rules?
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.680]   Verse 21, do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.500]   These rules, which have to do with things
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.380]   that are destined to perish with use,
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.540]   are based only on human commands and teachings.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.240]   Such regulations indeed have the appearance,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.860]   this religious acts have the appearance of wisdom
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.500]   with their self-imposed worship,
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.280]   their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body,
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.140]   but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.800]   So Paul basically says, look, living the new life,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.740]   let me start with what it is in case you're going,
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.360]   what, new moons, festivals and celebrations?
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.800]   Yeah, the next time somebody tries to look down on you
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.260]   for a new moon celebration, I'm kidding, bad joke.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.820]   Okay, so in 16th, what he's basically laying out,
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.840]   hey, these are all religious things
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.680]   that you are being told you need to do
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.240]   to live out the new life, and Paul says,
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.000]   no, those are not it at all, those are silly things.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.880]   The vision and worship of angels, new moon festivals,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.720]   that's not how you live out the new life.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   Here's how you live out the new life, starting in verse one.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.380]   Since then, you have been raised with Christ.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.380]   Speaking of the resurrection, so you may not know this,
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.980]   but when you came to faith in Jesus,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.420]   if you're a follower of Jesus, when you said,
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.700]   I trust Jesus paid on the cross for my sins,
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.740]   Paul, and the Bible teaches that you
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.180]   died with Christ on the cross
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.560]   and you were resurrected with him,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.460]   that you went through a resurrection in a spiritual sense,
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.780]   and you're going, what, when did I die, when did I rise?
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.900]   In a spiritual sense, when Jesus died and Jesus rose,
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.540]   he gave you a new life, just like he came back to life,
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.820]   you died and you were given a new life.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.580]   There's gonna come a day where you will physically rise,
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.440]   but spiritually speaking, Paul says,
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.020]   you have already been resurrected
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.700]   and already previously died.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.060]   And since that has taken place,
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.220]   set your hearts on things above,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.020]   where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God,
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.580]   set your minds on things above, not on earthly things,
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.020]   for you died and your life is now hidden
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.060]   with Christ in God, this is our first point.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.060]   We are made new, this is how believers are made new,
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.820]   by our resurrection, not religion.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.140]   We are made new by our resurrection,
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.240]   that when Christ died, we died with him,
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.820]   and spiritually speaking, we were given new life,
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.860]   that you have gone through in a spiritual sense,
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.300]   you've been given a new life, and the way you embrace
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.700]   this new life is so huge.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.220]   The way you and I begin to start embracing
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.920]   the new life that we have, all begins on the inside.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.140]   It all begins, according to Paul, look at the verse,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.340]   set your hearts, set your minds on things above.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.100]   That God is not a God, he's not saying,
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.220]   hey, here's a bunch of rules,
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.540]   this is how you do the new life.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.480]   God says, I don't work outside in, I work inside out.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.820]   My goal is not for you to just do good things
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.380]   and change you from a good person to a better person,
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.340]   I take dead people and I make them alive.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.980]   That's how I work, and I work from the inside out.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.700]   My goal is not just for you to stop being anxious,
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.340]   and for you to not go to the bars,
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.380]   and stop looking at porn, I want your heart to be changed.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.360]   So Paul says, in order to begin embracing
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.460]   your resurrected life, it starts with the mind,
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.260]   and it starts with the heart,
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.420]   and fixing it on things that are eternal.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.860]   He says, if you and I can begin to focus
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.420]   not on what's going on around us,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.340]   not on this earth, not on things that are passing away,
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.980]   but fixing our eyes on what's eternal,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.440]   on what matters, on the fact that we're gonna be here
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.180]   for only a few more instants, then it's gonna be gone,
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.060]   we're gonna be with Christ forever and ever and ever.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:36.060]   That's, he says, where change begins to take place.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.540]   If you and I can orient our minds around the reality
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.140]   of the future eternity awaiting us,
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.500]   and the resurrection that you have already experienced
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.620]   in Christ, through faith in Christ, change begins.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.860]   Here's how I know that's true.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.420]   If you and I really come to grips with the fact
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.700]   that we have, in Christ, died and be given a new life,
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.740]   gone through a resurrection, we would begin
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.180]   to experience life in a whole new, different way.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.960]   There was a guy, actually, in the Bible,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.180]   you may know this story, who actually really gives us
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.460]   a great example of what it looks like
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.140]   when a person really understands
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.340]   and really experiences death and new life.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.060]   His name was Lazarus.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.140]   Jesus comes up to a guy named Lazarus.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.180]   Lazarus is a single young adult.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.180]   His closest friends are his two sisters, Mary and Martha.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.980]   You probably heard this story.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.620]   They're really close with Jesus.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.260]   There comes a day where Lazarus, this is in John 11,
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.400]   if you wanna go read this later,
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   where Lazarus, he gets sick, and he dies.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.320]   The next scene we're given is really,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.580]   they're at the funeral, and Lazarus is in the tomb,
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.780]   and Jesus shows up, and he's talking with the family,
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.680]   and the family says, "Oh, man, if you had only been here."
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   And Jesus says, "Lazarus, come out of the tomb."
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.820]   And Lazarus walks out of the tomb alive.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.900]   This man who had been dead
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.300]   had been totally raised back to life.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.740]   Now, let me ask you this.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.160]   Do you think after walking through death and resurrection,
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.080]   Lazarus' life the second time around
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.660]   was different than the first time?
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.360]   In other words, Lazarus dies.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.000]   He's a single young adult.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   He's got bills to pay.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.240]   He's trying to figure things out.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.480]   Maybe he would be a porchy,
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.200]   and he's trying to figure out life, and then he dies.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.360]   Do you think when he comes back to life,
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.640]   he's worried, anxious, bogged down
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.120]   about the things he used to be?
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.960]   Like, he's still going, "Oh, my gosh, great.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.680]   "I'm back, and I'm still single, God.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.720]   "How am I gonna afford rent in Jerusalem?
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.700]   "It's out of control in here.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.000]   "Unbelievable, this world has fallen apart."
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.580]   Do you think that after experiencing this new life,
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.880]   that the things, even the way he saw this life was the same?
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.540]   In fact, the next chapter, we're told that really,
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.660]   because Jesus raised him from the dead,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.200]   and crowds, like, it exploded.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.680]   Jesus' followers exploded
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.660]   'cause he raised the guy from the dead,
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.280]   which just happens if you raise somebody from the dead,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.640]   I guess, and so all these people are following Jesus,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.520]   and the religious elite said, "We need to kill Lazarus, too."
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.720]   And word gets back to Lazarus.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.920]   Do you think it scared Lazarus that time?
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.080]   He's like, "They're gonna kill me.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.120]   "I've been there, done that.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.600]   "What am I afraid of anymore?
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.380]   "Jesus is all that matters."
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.960]   And Paul continues, really, around this idea
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.760]   of if we could understand that as real as Lazarus
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.980]   being raised from the dead
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.620]   was you being raised from the dead and given new life,
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.540]   it would change everything.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.440]   He continues saying, in verse four,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   "When Christ, who is your life, appears,
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.720]   "then you will also be with him,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.520]   "or you will appear with him in glory."
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.540]   That Christ is your life.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.860]   I mean, this was so real to Paul.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.540]   Jesus is not a concept.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.580]   Jesus is not a component of life.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.540]   He says Jesus is life.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.820]   Remember those shirts that say baseball is life?
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.940]   Baseball's not life.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.240]   Shopping is not life.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.580]   Sex is not life.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.800]   Marriage is not life.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.580]   Jesus is life, Paul says.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.480]   Ironically, in the same passage, John 11,
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.980]   when Jesus comes up to the tomb,
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.580]   and they said, "If only you had been here,
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.120]   "Lazarus would not be dead.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.040]   "He would be alive.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.000]   "He would have life."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.360]   And Jesus responds, saying, "I am life.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.960]   "I am all that life is about.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.420]   "I'm all it will ever be about.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.220]   "I'm the only place you will ever find
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.120]   "true satisfaction in life."
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.000]   Jesus is life.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.420]   He is not a component.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.680]   He is life.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.060]   He's all, and if you know him,
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.640]   that's why Jesus is the only thing that will ever satisfy.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.300]   Really, regardless, he's the only thing.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.760]   But especially if you've been raised
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.160]   to walk in newness of life.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.360]   And he is your life, Paul says.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.500]   He now continues and says,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.560]   "How do we live out this new life?"
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.680]   And he begins, really, by talking about our old life.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.000]   Verse five.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.400]   "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs,"
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.920]   so set your minds on things above,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.080]   "and put to death whatever belongs to your earthly nature."
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.460]   Let me just say what he just said.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.900]   He just said, "People who have been raised
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.720]   "to new life in Christ have earthly nature,"
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.240]   or sin nature, you may have if you have the ESV,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.620]   inside of them.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.140]   It doesn't just immediately go away,
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.360]   they have to put it to death, or put an end to it,
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.000]   Paul says, and now he's gonna tell us
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.820]   some of what we are to put an end to.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.820]   "Sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires,
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.000]   "greed, which is idolatry.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.360]   "Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.460]   "You used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.620]   "but now you must also rid yourself
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.220]   "of all such things as these, anger, rage,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.420]   "malice, slander, filthy language from your lips.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.080]   "Do not lie to each other."
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.620]   So he says, "Take all of these things
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.560]   "that are part of your old nature,
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.000]   "and I want you to put an end to them."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.440]   And he's about to tell us how,
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.620]   but I think if you're back in church
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.660]   for the first time in a long time,
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.460]   or maybe first time ever,
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.700]   oftentimes what Christians hear
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.400]   when they read a verse like this
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.360]   is just Paul saying, "Stop lying,
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.580]   "stop thinking lustful thoughts,
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.140]   "stop being angry, stop being filled with rage,
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.260]   "just stop cussing, even when you're in traffic,
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.660]   "stop all those things, just stop it."
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.900]   And so we hear that message,
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.980]   and maybe even tonight, or even on messages
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.500]   that we're not trying to communicate exactly that,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.080]   or that's not the fullness of it,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.040]   you hear that, and then you go,
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.960]   "Yes, this is gonna be my week.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.580]   "I'm not cussing in any traffic.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.660]   "I'm out of here, I'll be here next week, no cussing."
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.280]   Then we go out, "No, I said it again.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.060]   "Okay, I'm back, I'm gonna try it again this next week."
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.200]   Paul would say, "That doesn't work.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.560]   "It's not just stop, stop it.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.060]   "That doesn't work."
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.180]   But he does tell us how and why, and how we stop.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.980]   Here's what he says.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.640]   "Since you have taken off the old self and its practices,
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.700]   "and you've put on the new self,
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.780]   "which is being you've been given a new self,
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.100]   "and it's not fully new."
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.020]   In other words, there's still renewal that takes place,
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.060]   and is being renewed in knowledge,
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.740]   in the image of its creator.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.740]   Paul just said, "The way and the process
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.640]   "through which you and I, who've been given a new self,
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.140]   "become increasingly new, is through the process
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.240]   "of what the Bible calls renewal."
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.700]   That you and I, the way that we put off the old,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.020]   and put on the on, we're gonna discuss in a second,
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.780]   is through the process of what Scripture calls renewal,
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.420]   or renewing our mind.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.900]   This is what Romans 12, two says.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.660]   "This is how you and I are transformed."
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.740]   It's not through just stop it, try harder,
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.380]   motivational pep talks, it's through renewal.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.220]   That's how it takes place.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.280]   This is what Romans 12, two.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.940]   "Do not conform to the pattern of this world,
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.020]   "but be transformed."
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.180]   How do I get transformed, Paul?
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.020]   By renewing, or by the renewing of your mind.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.620]   This is how you transform.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.160]   This is how you change.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.860]   If you are struggling right now, with anxiety,
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.300]   or with a sexual relationship, or with materialism,
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.920]   whatever it is, insert fill in the blank,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.380]   the way you change is not me going,
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.440]   no, stop it, stop it right now.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.480]   That's not how you change.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.460]   Paul says, "The process by which we change is renewal."
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.660]   Having our minds renewed.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.840]   Now what is renewal?
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.260]   When the Bible speaks about renewal,
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.980]   it speaks, renew means make again new, again new.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.380]   That's what renew means.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.340]   And when the Bible speaks of the process of renewal,
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.500]   there's really two components of it.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.180]   It involves taking off and putting on.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.820]   It's like when girls do nail polish,
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.640]   and you guys use that stuff that eats through the floor,
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.900]   if it gets on there, it's like, what is that called?
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.740]   Whatever it's called.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.960]   You gotta take it off, right?
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.580]   My wife is so embarrassed right now.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.300]   You gotta take it off, and then you gotta paint,
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.540]   or then you put on the other one.
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.300]   And so in the same way, renewal takes place,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.700]   and it's not called painting, is it?
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.460]   Renewal takes place when you take off and you put on.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.060]   Now what do we take off and put on?
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.660]   'Cause it's renewing our mind.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.740]   The process by which we take off, or what we take off,
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.760]   is the lies that you and I believe
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.500]   that fuel our bad behavior.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.980]   And we put on the truth about reality,
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.940]   about the world around us, truth all found in God's word.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.900]   But we renew our mind by taking off the lie
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.960]   and putting on the truth.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.340]   'Cause here's what I know about you, and I know about me.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.900]   Every bad behavior, every sinful behavior,
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.660]   every struggle that you have is fueled by a lie.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.940]   Right now, everything.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.260]   Every time that you sin, it's fueled by a lie.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.140]   Satan is called the deceiver of the entire world,
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.380]   Revelation 12 calls him.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.460]   That your problem, anytime you're like,
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.780]   oh man, I'm just struggling, I need to get better,
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.660]   is because you're believing a lie at some level.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.560]   In my, even marriage with my wife, our conflicts,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.360]   we have conflict Sunday night,
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.320]   driving back from me doing a wedding.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.280]   And we have conflict 'cause I'm selfish.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.120]   You know why I'm selfish?
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.620]   'Cause that selfishness is fueled by a lie
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.280]   that my wife is here to serve me.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.040]   And it's a lie.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.680]   When God's word and truth tells me
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.240]   that I have been put into a mutually submissive relationship
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.260]   where I am there to serve her.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.600]   If you are struggling with an eating disorder,
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.440]   it's fueled by a lie.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.860]   It may not be all the same one, but it is fueled by a lie.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.920]   Satan comes to deceive, to kill, and to destroy.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.680]   Pornography, fueled by a lie.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.300]   Sleeping with your boyfriend, fueled by a lie.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.200]   Anxiety, fueled by a lie.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.900]   I'm in control, or I'm afraid God's not in control.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.820]   Or I'm afraid God's not really good and in control.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:06.040]   Or I think my way would be better than his way.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.880]   All those different circles are fueled by lies.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.960]   And Paul says, the way you change,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.760]   this is how people change.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.960]   It's not they just finally go,
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   I'm putting my boots on, this is my day.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.340]   It's by taking off the old and putting on the new.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.880]   Renewing your mind.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.980]   If you change, you are a new person.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.720]   You have a new self.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   And you renew that new self by changing the way you think.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.680]   Taking off the lies, putting on the truth of God's word.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.300]   And that changes how you live.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.280]   This is why some of you,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.720]   like you're in the room and you've been struggling
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.640]   for a while with whatever it is.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.500]   And you just are like, man, I feel hopeless.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.240]   I've prayed the prayer to accept Christ like 27 times,
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.780]   and I just can't seem to get over X,
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.680]   my anxiety, my pornography, whatever it is.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.040]   That's not the problem at all.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.000]   For some of you, maybe you should trust Christ.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.760]   But for some of you who have, the problem is renewal.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   You haven't renewed your mind.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.640]   There's no secret there.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.960]   This is the process by which people change
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.420]   and pulses we take off by putting on the new.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:23.240]   Verse 11, he continues, and I wish we really had time
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.560]   to cover this more fully, but we'll comb through it
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.480]   and then pop on to our next point.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.520]   "Here in Christ, there is no Gentile or Jew,"
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.040]   so there's no racial distinction.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.160]   "There is no circumcised or uncircumcised."
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.340]   In other words, there's no religious distinction.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.920]   "There is no barbarian or Scythian,"
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.280]   which is the barbarians were,
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.040]   basically, there's no education distinction.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.760]   Barbarians were called that
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.600]   because they couldn't speak Greek.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.480]   Well, they would, bah, bah, bah.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.040]   I hear bah, bah, bah, ran every time I do that.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.880]   I don't know why, but I do.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.720]   My team was like, don't say that.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.480]   I was like, I'm gonna do my best.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.600]   Just come down.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.760]   Scythian was the same thing.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.140]   It's just like, rogue, bad, were like the barbarians.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.620]   Slave or free, there's no distinction,
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.540]   but Christ is all that matters,
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.140]   and Christ lives in all of us.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.620]   That he says there are no categories inside of the church,
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.020]   inside of God's people, through Christ.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.460]   He's all that matters, and he lives in all of us.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.500]   Social distinctions, the color of your skin,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.780]   the amount that you make, none of it matters.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.980]   Christ is all that matters.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.180]   And if he lives in them, there's no distinction
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.240]   between them and the next person,
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.220]   who he lives in, his followers.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.100]   I mean, I wish we had time to camp here,
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.860]   'cause I feel like our nation is so hurting right now.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.980]   And how you look around at Baltimore,
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.220]   you look around at what's been going on
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.920]   for the past few months in New York, Ferguson,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.720]   and how important it is that the church,
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.660]   there be a body of people, Paul says,
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.640]   that when they come together,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.780]   what defines them is not their skin tone.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.460]   What defines them is not the job that they work.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.380]   What defines them is not where they grew up,
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.500]   or where they were born.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.380]   What defines them is Jesus, he's all that matters.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.100]   And they know that, and they believe that,
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.340]   and they've trusted in that, and that is a group of people.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.500]   And when people begin to see,
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.900]   when the world sees a group like that, it's powerful.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.020]   That's how change happens.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.380]   That's how the church, in those situations,
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.060]   can be the church, and can rise up and say,
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.560]   it may happen here, it may happen in that city,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.180]   but it's not gonna happen inside of God's people.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.940]   It's not gonna happen here.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.080]   We gotta keep moving.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.520]   Okay, that was a sad note, probably, hopefully worth it.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.140]   Verse 12, therefore, as God's chosen,
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.980]   so he begins to tell us what the new life looks like.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.900]   So this is what the new life,
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.620]   so you take off through renewing your mind,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.580]   and here's what it looks like
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.180]   whenever you begin to renew your mind,
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.640]   and here's what the new life looks like.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.100]   Therefore, as God's chosen people,
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.340]   holy and dearly loved, I'm gonna read that again.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:03.740]   Therefore, as God's chosen people, if you're a Christian,
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:11.000]   as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.480]   you know what Paul just said?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.900]   He just said that when God looks at you,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:23.520]   if you know Jesus, he doesn't see your sin from today,
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.760]   he doesn't see your sin from yesterday.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.520]   When he looks at you, he sees,
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.920]   and he knows all the sin from your past life.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.220]   He knows everything you've done today
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.080]   and will do tomorrow and the next day,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.800]   and he looks at you because of your faith in Jesus,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.240]   and he says, "Mine, chosen, I love you,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.740]   "righteous, holy, mine."
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.320]   That's who you are.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.500]   If you've trusted in Christ, that's who you are,
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.240]   and some of you, that's what you need to hear
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.400]   more than anything else in this message.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.280]   That's who you are.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   That's who you are, righteous, holy, loved.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.800]   And as those people, here's what he's gonna tell us
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   to clothe ourselves with, compassion, kindness, clothes.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.380]   Let these be the things that you put on each day,
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.380]   like the clothes you wear, humility, gentleness, patience.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.740]   Bear with each other and forgive one another
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.180]   if any of you has a grievance against someone.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.540]   Forgive as the Lord forgave you,
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.060]   and over all of these virtues, put on love,
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.460]   which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.280]   That these are the church clothes.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.220]   Remember when you were a kid and your mom,
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.560]   maybe this is just me, my mom,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.400]   she would come in and be like,
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.220]   "We gotta get ready for church here, put on this,"
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.500]   and then I would put something on,
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.060]   and she'd be like, "You can't wear that.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.280]   "You can't wear soccer shorts to church.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.460]   "You have to bring your finest
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.300]   "to the house of the Lord."
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.180]   And I'd always be like, "What?
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.680]   "Why does God want me in khakis?
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.120]   "What, why do I have to wear these things?"
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.780]   The clothes that are to mark the church,
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.700]   turns out those were not the clothes
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.740]   that are to mark the church.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.860]   But love, compassion, gentleness, kindness,
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.300]   these are church clothes.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.500]   These are to be the things that Christians adore.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.500]   This is honestly why people have a bad perception
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.320]   of the church, is because there's so many believers
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.100]   running around without their clothes on,
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.240]   to use the metaphor that Paul uses here.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.440]   They're not running around clothed with love,
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.620]   kindness, compassion, gentleness.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.540]   They're running around clothed
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.460]   with either form or life clothes,
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.360]   and Paul says these are the things that you are to put on.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.220]   And it's like, how attractive are these?
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.700]   Like, humility looks good on everybody.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.180]   Love looks good on everybody.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.040]   Kindness looks good on everyone.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.660]   Unlike the opposite things of our sinful nature,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.260]   where it's like, no one's ever thought,
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.420]   oh my gosh, let me tell you what's hot, anger.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.940]   Greed, he was greedy.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.120]   No one's ever thought.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.500]   What is wrong with me?
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.940]   I have too much coffee today.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.260]   But it's true, right?
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.100]   Like, these are the things.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.840]   These are the things the church is meant to put on.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.520]   These are the things that we are to put on.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.740]   And here's how we really do it.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.560]   Here's how we, through renewing our mind,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.180]   we take off and we put on,
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.140]   and here's one of the ways that we renew our mind.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.060]   Verse 15 and 16.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.500]   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts,
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.380]   since as members of one body, you were called to peace.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.980]   So live in peace with one another.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.700]   He begins to talk about one another.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.520]   And be thankful.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.000]   Let the message of Christ dwell among you together,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.740]   richly or abundantly, you may have in there.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.620]   Let it be saturated with the abundance of Christ's words
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.940]   in your midst together,
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.900]   and admonish and teach one another.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.820]   The message of Christ is in like the gospels,
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.060]   the Bible, it would translate for us.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.780]   Let that be among your lips as you talk and engage
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.740]   with one another with all wisdom through psalms,
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.700]   hymns, and songs from the Spirit,
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   singing to God with gratitude in your heart.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.580]   So Paul just said, what, get together and sing?
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.860]   Like Christian karaoke?
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.900]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.400]   He's saying, in this culture, they didn't have Bibles.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.220]   You probably know that, but they really,
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.460]   this was early on, they had just maybe a letter, maybe two.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.020]   And they would get together, and Paul says,
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.740]   I want you to take the teachings that you know
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.540]   from Jesus and his apostles.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.820]   I want you to sing together as you come together.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.060]   I want you to speak into each other's lives.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.980]   I want you to sing songs to one another
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.660]   and gather around each other,
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.460]   that you and I are to be marked with new relationships.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.300]   That's our third point,
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.680]   new relationships with God's people renders change,
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.920]   that you and I are to get together.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.780]   And why are they talking about Jesus's word to one another?
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.900]   Why are they singing songs?
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.620]   They renew each other's mind.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.400]   This is what Paul's driving towards,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.540]   that as you come together,
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.760]   I want you to speak to one another the truth.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.540]   This is why we harp on community so much around here,
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.820]   because all of us need, I need you, and you need me,
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.060]   and we gotta come together, and we lock arms.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.320]   That's what we do in community,
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.300]   and we speak the truth to one another.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.780]   We speak from God's word,
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   and we help each other take off the lie.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.300]   I'm not letting you go, and I need you to not let me go,
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.900]   because we're all broken.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.580]   There's no special pastorage up here where we don't,
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.300]   I'm jacked up just like everyone else in this room.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.500]   There is no Superman.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.800]   We're all just mere mortals who are all prone to go crazy.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.480]   This is why we harp on community,
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.420]   'cause if you and I do not renew our mind,
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.100]   you will not live new, and neither will I.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.060]   And so we get together every single week.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.900]   We look in the whites of each other's eyes.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.460]   We say, I know you're broken, and I'm gonna help you,
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.560]   and I need you to help me.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.760]   Will you speak the truth when I'm drifting away,
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.500]   when I want to look at something I shouldn't be looking at,
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.620]   when I'm anxious and I shouldn't be anxious,
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.300]   when I'm driven by people-pleasing,
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.980]   will you tell me and call me out?
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.100]   Will you speak to me?
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.700]   Will you help me renew my mind?
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.540]   That's what they're doing.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.100]   Paul says, I want you to get together,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.460]   and I want you to speak God's word over each other.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.140]   I want you to sing songs together
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.580]   so that your minds on a day-by-day process are renewed.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.300]   That's how you change.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.880]   That's how you change.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.540]   There's no magic secret sauce.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.100]   It's just an everyday moments,
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.460]   everyday, ordinary moments where we get together,
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.500]   and a lot of you do this every single week.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.100]   It's your experience and change.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.820]   In coffee shops all over the city,
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.900]   on Wednesday mornings and Friday mornings
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.900]   and Tuesday after the porch and Monday nights
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.560]   and all every day of the week,
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.340]   people gather around and they speak the truth
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.580]   to one another.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.980]   That's what he's driving at.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:35.100]   Because left by ourself, our minds don't get renewed.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.260]   Renewal is a team sport.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.140]   I need you and you need me.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.300]   And it's through the one another's
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:47.060]   we begin to experience change thinking, change lives.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.540]   And this really isn't new.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:55.840]   This really has been the way God's always done it.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.620]   From the very beginning.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.700]   It's not good for man to be alone.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.340]   There's 62 one anothers in the New Testament.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.180]   62 verses or 62 places where it talks about
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.860]   do this one another, one another,
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.180]   be together, one another.
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.680]   That's who you are, my people.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.280]   Help each other, renew each other's mind.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.080]   Come together.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.040]   And the earliest, outside of the Bible,
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.080]   you know the earliest reference to Christian literature
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.380]   that we have actually comes from a governor
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.280]   not far from Colossae.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.960]   So inside of the Roman Empire,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.040]   there was a guy who in 111 AD,
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.560]   this is so amazing to me and probably only me,
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.700]   hopefully not, but so in 111 AD,
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.200]   there was a guy named Pliny the Younger
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.080]   and he's the governor of an area in Turkey
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.120]   which is where Colossae is.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.800]   And he's writing to the emperor and it's 111,
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.840]   it's 10 years after John, the apostle John,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.040]   remember him, took care of Jesus' mom,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.160]   10 years after John's dead.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.780]   So this is early in the game.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.600]   And he's writing and Pliny who's not a Christian,
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.400]   he writes to the emperor of Rome and he says,
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.320]   there's all these Christians popping up everywhere.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.600]   What am I supposed to do with them?
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.240]   I've never really handled Christians before
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.080]   but they're everywhere.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.600]   He says in the letter, you should Google,
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.320]   Pliny the Younger to Trajan,
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.080]   Pliny the Younger for those of you
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.240]   who wanna look it up later.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.360]   And in the letter, he says, there's Christians
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.400]   and they're exploding of every age, every sex,
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.640]   every area of life, they're coming
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.920]   and these Christians, they're going into the cities
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.880]   and into the towns, what should I do with them?
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.640]   And he says, I've begun to investigate
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.120]   and I began torturing to find out from them
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.680]   what they're all about 'cause I don't really know
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.400]   what Christians are all about.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.640]   What do you think I should do, Trajan?
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.680]   And in that letter, Pliny says this
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.680]   about what he discovered about this new cult
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.520]   that he didn't understand.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.020]   This is what they were doing.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.760]   The sum and substance of their fault or error
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.880]   had been they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.080]   This is your heritage.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.680]   Before dawn and sing a response
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.240]   that they'd come together on a fixed day before work,
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.560]   they'd get together and it's still dark
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.880]   and they would sing a song to Christ as God.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.280]   And then they would bind themselves with an oath
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.200]   and it wasn't an oath to commit some crime, I love that.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.160]   Pliny's thinking, how bizarre are these people?
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.080]   They would bind themselves not to commit a crime
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.780]   but to not commit a crime, to not commit fraud,
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.320]   to not commit theft, to not commit adultery
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.160]   or to falsify their trust or to keep their word.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.360]   They would come together and they'd say,
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.280]   I need you, will you help me today?
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.840]   I don't wanna commit adultery today.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.520]   I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna steal, will you help me?
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.760]   And they sang to Christ all together.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.000]   And then it says this, after they were done,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.040]   when this was over, it was their custom to depart
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.000]   and then they would come back together
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.280]   and they would partake of food.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.840]   So they would leave, they'd go to their jobs
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   and they'd come back together and they would eat
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.080]   and they would help each other and say,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.680]   look, we're not gonna get focused
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.360]   on things that are on this earth.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.320]   We're gonna fix our eyes as long as we're on this planet
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.800]   on things that are eternal and I don't do that on my own.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.560]   So I need help.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.400]   And today, collectively, we're gonna take an oath.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.240]   I mean, how amazing is that?
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.760]   It's Pliny's writing in the letter, he's going,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.400]   why are we arresting these people?
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.660]   They're the best Romans we have.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:29.400]   And they came together day after day, renewing their mind.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.240]   This is how it's always been done.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.760]   This is how change happens.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.300]   That's how you change.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.240]   That's how Christians change.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.720]   I know across the room, for those of us who are believers,
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.960]   I mean, we have every type of,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.240]   if you're in a community group or a Bible study,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   I think the question that I ask when I look at this
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.680]   is how am I doing at this?
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.560]   Is it not enough to just have a group,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.920]   but am I coming together?
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.880]   Am I renewing my mind?
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.480]   Are people speaking into my life?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.100]   Am I taking off the lies?
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   Am I replacing with truth, with others speaking in?
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.560]   Help me not go after what looks dead.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.800]   I have a new self, and tomorrow morning,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.920]   I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna go wander
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.900]   after what's dead.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.400]   So I need you to help me.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.080]   How am I doing at that?
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.120]   How are you doing at that?
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.320]   Do you have that group?
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.720]   That's why we harp, not 'cause we're like,
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.200]   we just love community groups.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.960]   It's in the watermark name.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.500]   Because we believe that's how God's always done it,
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.660]   how we'll always do it.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.060]   Every night at the porch,
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.100]   we have open community group afterwards.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.820]   There's one thing you can be a part of here.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.700]   It's not the porch, and I mean at watermark.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.900]   It's being, doing life with other people,
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.620]   renewing your mind.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.380]   Because what happened to this group, Pliny referenced,
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.080]   is that as they came together, they were changed.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.260]   And they changed the world.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.460]   They changed Asia Minor.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.520]   They exploded.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.440]   That's what happened.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.400]   If you go back and read church history,
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.040]   as people see the new life lived out.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.600]   If you're not a believer, man, we'd love to talk to you
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.400]   about where you are in the faith journey.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.200]   The reason you can't live out the new life
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.240]   is you don't have new life.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.620]   But God offers that to you.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:29.380]   Just by believing, it's better news than you can imagine.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.480]   There's nothing you can do to earn it.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   And he offers it to you if you'll just accept it.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.600]   And we believe, we were praying as a team,
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.360]   we believe there's people in the room,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.520]   there's a person in this room tonight,
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.780]   and it's your night.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.920]   And you're gonna leave the grave clothes behind
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.720]   and come walk in newness of life.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.380]   I did a wedding this past weekend,
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:57.380]   and weddings are really interesting moments
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.040]   where I'm like the officiant,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.400]   and there's a bride and groom, of course,
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.280]   and maybe not for long, bad joke, okay.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.320]   Okay.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.200]   Man, moment killer.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.880]   And in that, there's like this moment that takes place
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.800]   where you pronounce man and wife.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.880]   And in an instant, the two become one.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.940]   Like literally a change the Bible tells us,
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.060]   and experientially we see happens
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.660]   where the two persons are now one.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.180]   They are no longer two, no longer a single man
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.420]   and a single woman, but they've been totally united.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.180]   That's who they are.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.660]   That's reality.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:46.660]   The two have become one, and now they get to experience
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:52.060]   all the benefits, all the opportunities
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.580]   that come with two becoming one.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.760]   They get to live together, they're sleeping together,
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.080]   they have a honeymoon, get excited.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.620]   They have all the benefits that come with those two
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.000]   because in an instant, they've changed.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.040]   They also get to experience the calling
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.080]   that God has for a husband.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.700]   This is what you do as a husband.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.000]   Now you get to not have poker night every night,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.200]   but you now are responsible.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.240]   You have one flesh.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.520]   This is who you are.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.320]   Be the husband who you are.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.920]   It's not be that or else you won't be a husband.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.200]   You are a husband.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.000]   You are one flesh.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.140]   Be who you are.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:32.180]   This is what Paul says changes people.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.120]   Renewing their minds, and it begins by accepting
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.440]   who you are.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.640]   Be who you are.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.740]   Who it defines you is not your sin struggle,
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.720]   not a relationship.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.560]   Be who you are.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.960]   You're not materialistic.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.600]   Even if today you worked out the credit card,
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.680]   you're not a porn addict.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.960]   If before the service you were looking at porn,
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.560]   that's not who you are.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.700]   And the way you can walk in freedom
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.760]   and really experience the reality
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.560]   that that's not who you are if you've trusted in Christ
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.260]   is by renewing your mind.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.080]   By renewing your mind, that's how you're transformed.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.280]   That's how you become increasingly free
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.200]   to live like who you really are.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.040]   And that takes place through knowing his word
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.760]   and through having others around us
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.280]   sing his truths and words over us
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.320]   as we take off the old and we put on the new.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.880]   I'm gonna pray that we do that.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:38.480]   Father, we need your help to really believe
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.240]   who you say that we are, to trust and to walk in that.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.800]   I pray tonight that right now,
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.720]   truly shackles will begin to fall off of people.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.360]   Whether they're shackles of trusting in themselves,
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.440]   trusting in what they've done,
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.640]   and they would trust only in what you have done.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.480]   But Jesus died on the cross for their sins.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.320]   I pray that shackles would fall off of sin,
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.480]   of mistaken identity, that minds would,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.840]   moving forward, continue to be renewed.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.200]   We pray that people would move out of isolation.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.920]   Would you renew us?
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.200]   Would we be your people, marked by your qualities?
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.200]   Holy, beloved, chosen, yours.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.240]   Thank you for Jesus.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.720]   Thank you that you've raised us to walk in newness of life.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.320]   Would the same perspective Lazarus had
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.000]   be one that I have, be one that we have,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.600]   if we know you, we love you, amen.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.100]   (music fades)
