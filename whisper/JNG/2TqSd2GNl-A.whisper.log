[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Hello, friends and sisters. I am Hsu. Welcome to our 10-part lecture.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Today's topic is "Who is my mentor?"
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   "Three-level understanding"
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   The content is in the 10th chapter of the Old Testament, 25-37, the parable of Osama bin Laden.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   The scripture is in the Old Testament. Let me read it.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   A lawmaker came up to Jesus and said, "Teacher, what should I do to be eternal?"
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Jesus said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   He replied, "You must do your best to love your God and love the Lord as yourself."
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Jesus said, "You are right. Your actions are life."
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   The man wanted to prove himself right, so he said to Jesus, "Who is my mentor?"
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Jesus replied, "There was a man who came down from Jerusalem and fell into the hands of the robbers.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   They took off his clothes and beat him to death.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   He was taken away by a man.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   A priest saw him coming down from the road and walked by him.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   A man from Nimeh saw him and walked by him.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   A man from Samaria saw him and fell in love with him.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   He poured wine on his wounds and wrapped them up.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   He carried him on his back and took him to the inn to take care of him.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   The next day he took two silver coins and handed them to the innkeeper and said,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   "Please take care of him. I will return the money I have taken when I return."
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   "Who is the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?"
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   He said, "It is the man who is in his name."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Jesus said, "You go and do as you have done."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I will divide this passage into two parts.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The latter part is the conversation from 25 to 29.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   After the conversation, Jesus will talk about the prophecy from 30 to 37.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Today I will first introduce some background information.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   For example, some people, some cultures, and some interpretations of the Bible at the time.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Then I will first look at this passage in the first level.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Then I will point out the place where the passage is found.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Then I will look at this passage twice in the third and fourth parts.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I will look at these two passages in different depths.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Before concluding, I will try to explain what it means to "endure forever"
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and how to follow God's command and obey God's law.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   The background of this story is from a geographical perspective.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   From the city of Jerusalem to Jericho.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   The city of Jerusalem is located at an altitude of 2,400 meters above the mountain.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Jericho is 720 meters below the waterline.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So the difference in altitude is 3,170 meters.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   What does this height mean?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   If you have lived in Hong Kong, you know that the highest mountain in Hong Kong is called the Great Wall Mountain.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The height of the Great Wall Mountain is 3,140 meters.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So it is equivalent to 17 miles from the Great Wall Mountain to the waterline.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   This is the background of the geography.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The picture next to it shows that many of the mountains are sloping.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It is quite dangerous.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It is difficult to detect if there is a force hiding behind it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   This is the metaphor used by Jesus Christ in this background.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   There are a few things I want to clarify.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   First, the word "God who is full of heart, full of mind, full of strength, full of love, and full of love for you"
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and "love the Lord and love yourself"
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   are related to love in the Hellenistic text.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   But today we want to talk about "love God" and "love the Lord"
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   in the Hellenistic text.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The word "Akabe" refers to God's love for people.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   This is the most important love.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It is a love without selfishness and conditions.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   That is to say, the love we are talking about today,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   the love of God, the love of the Holy Spirit,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   is to meet the moral range of God's love for the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It is just a love without selfishness.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It is not about love between family members.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   There is another word for love between family members,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   love between men and women, and love between friends.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   The love we are talking about today is the love between God and people.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It is like God's love for people in the Christian world.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   If we use the Interlinear Bible on the Internet,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   we will see the words of the Hellenistic text.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   If you click into each word of the Hellenistic text,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   there is an English translation.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   The word "heart" refers to thoughts or feelings,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   the heart of a person, the heart of your thoughts.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   The word "soul" refers to the word "soul"
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   in the Old Testament when Adam was created,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   God breathed into Adam, and Adam had the spirit of life.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So the Holy Spirit, which is all your life,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   came to love God together.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   The word "power" is easier to understand,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   which means to use all your ability,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   your method to love God.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   The word "soul" refers to a deep level of thought,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   which means you need a will.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   In addition to emotional thought,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   we also need a will.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   This is very important.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   When we finally explain the love of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I will go back to why these four things are together.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   This wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   wholeheartedly love God and love the Holy Spirit and yourself,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   this sentence is not in the Old Testament.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Because this sentence is actually composed of two Old Testament verses.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   The first part of "Love God" is mentioned in the sixth chapter of the Bible.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   In the 49th chapter of the Leviticus,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   there is a second part of "Love God, Love Your Spirit, Love Yourself."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I want everyone to pay attention to the three words "wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly"
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   in the Old Testament.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Some books of the Gospels explain this.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Because in the Hebrew text,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   the first word "wholeheartedly" includes the meaning of "wholeheartedly."
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So in the Old Testament, it means "wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly."
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   In the Bible, it means "wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly love God."
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Because it is clearly defined in the Hebrew text.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   These two greatest revolutions were not mentioned for the first time.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   In Matthew 12 and 22,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   there were two prophets or lawmakers
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   who debated or tested the knowledge of the Bible.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   At that time, these two prophets or lawmakers
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   asked the same question,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   which one is the most important among the revolutions?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Jesus answered, "Wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly love God, your God, and love yourself."
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   This time, the lawmaker's question was different from the one asked by Jesus before the prophecy.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He asked, "Teacher, what should I do?"
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   What can I do to be eternal?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   It is not about which one is the most important.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   The lawmaker had prepared his answer.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   So when Jesus asked him how to write the law,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   he immediately came up with the answer.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   He asked himself and answered himself.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   The motivation of this conversation, if we look at the Bible,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   the lawmaker tested Jesus.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   This test may not necessarily mean to make him suffer.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Because we saw two examples before.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Some scholars really think that Jesus came out to explain the Bible like a scholar.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Many people followed him.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   He said something more authoritative.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   They wanted to debate with him to see if he was telling the truth or not.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I think it's a test in this form to see how much he could weigh.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It's a way of debating with him.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   So when he talked to Jesus, he also called Jesus as a teacher.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   After answering Jesus,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   he debated with him to prove that he was right.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   But if we look at the structure of the whole debate, it is very special.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   At the beginning, the lawmaker challenged Jesus like a teacher.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Jesus answered the same way.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Let's look at the first paragraph.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   The lawmaker asked what he could do to be eternal.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Notice that Jesus did not answer this question.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Jesus used a question-and-answer method to ask how to write the law.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   How to understand.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   How to read.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   How to understand.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Why did Jesus ask two questions?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Because you know how to write the law.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   If your understanding is wrong, it is wrong.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   So he asked two questions.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   The lawmaker answered.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   He already had an answer.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   He answered with all his heart, all his strength, etc.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I am God and I am written for myself.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Jesus made a conclusion.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   You are right.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   This is how to live.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   This is the first dialogue.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   The second dialogue has the same structure.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   The lawmaker asked again who is my successor?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Jesus did not answer.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Jesus asked again who is the successor of this victim?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   This led the lawmaker to answer.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   It is the question-and-answer method.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Jesus made a conclusion.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   You are right.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So at first, Jesus was like a debate.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   The lawmaker was like a judge.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Jesus made a very ingenious dialogue.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   He became the main speaker.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   The lawmaker became the answerer.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I have four dialogues with four people.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I want to compare them with you.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Because these four passages are related to our explanation today.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   We noticed that Jesus talked to different people.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   There are different ways to discuss the truth.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Sometimes it is very similar.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   But there are also different ways.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   For example, he and Nebuchadnezzar
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   were recording in the Book of Revelation.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   When talking about resurrection,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Nebuchadnezzar could not figure out how to
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   resurrect the story in his mother's womb.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Jesus directly explained to him
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   "If man is not born again from water and the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   He said that only those who are resurrected by the Holy Spirit
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   can enter heaven.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   He directly explained the truth.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   For Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   there was a dialogue.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Nebuchadnezzar's question was the same as the lawmaker's.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   What should I do to be resurrected?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Jesus directly explained his biggest question.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   You have to change everything to follow me.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Because Jesus saw people's hearts.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   He knew this was his biggest problem.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   What you can't do is your problem.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   In the Book of Revelation,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   there is a story about a man from Palestine,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Simon, who invited Jesus to his house.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But he did not treat Jesus politely.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He did not wash his feet with him.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   He respected Jesus as a guest.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   But at that time, a woman who was drunk
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   went to Jesus and washed his feet with tears.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   She used her hair to wipe his feet.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Jesus asked Simon a question.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   If a creditor has two creditors,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   one owes 500 and the other 50,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and the creditor also exempts the two people from debt,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   which creditor will be more grateful to the creditor?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Will he love more?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Simon's answer was that
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   the one who has more credit will love the creditor more.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   This story is related to today's story.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I will tell you again when I meet you.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Today we will talk about the Lawyer.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   After two conversations with Jesus Christ,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   he told the truth.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   This is the Lawyer, the one who taught others.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   We will now look at the content of these scriptures.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   There are different types of people mentioned here.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   What kind of people are the Lawyer and the Priest?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   At that time, the Jews were ruled by the Romans.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   So politically they were powerless.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Militarily they were powerless.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But among the people,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   they had a court.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   The Lawyer was appointed by the Roman Empire.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   They established a religious court
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   to govern the internal affairs of the Jews,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   especially religious affairs.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Among them, the Lawyer and the Priest
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   were the most important people in the power center.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   The Lawyer and the Priest could only be
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   the descendants of Aaron.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Aaron was the brother of Moses
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   when he went to Egypt.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   So he could only be the descendant of Aaron.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Aaron was also a Lawyer.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   If you are a Lawyer,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   but not from Aaron's family,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   you are responsible for other religious affairs.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   These are the assistants.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   These are the assistants of the Lawyer.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   They were all responsible for the work in the temple.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   It is recorded that
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   there were about 18,000 Lawyers in the time of Jesus.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   They served in the temple in turns.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Father John was one of the Lawyers.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Among the Lawyers,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   there were 22 people from the Lawyers and the Priest.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   So they were another power center.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They were familiar with the Bible
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   and strictly followed the rules of the Bible.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But at that time, Jesus criticized them
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and said that their hearts were far from God.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   They said that they were reverent and devoted to God,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   but their hearts were far from God.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   They did not respect God.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   At the same time,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   their concept of enemies
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   was wrong according to Jesus' teaching.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Because Jesus told them
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   that they should listen to the commandment
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   "Love your neighbor as you hate your enemy."
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   But Jesus taught them
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   that they should love their enemies.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   The persecuted should pray.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   The persecuted should pray.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   It means that when you love your neighbor,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   your neighbor includes your enemy.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It doesn't mean you should hate your enemy.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Why did they have a wrong concept?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Because if they look back at the Old Testament,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   it mentioned what a neighbor was.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   The Bible says that
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   the neighbor is your people.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Don't love your neighbor in any way.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Your neighbor is your people.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And in the 34th chapter of the Old Testament,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   the neighbor is your people.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It means that the people who are your people
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   should love them as they love themselves.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   This is the concept of their neighbor at that time.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   My people, Jews,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   or the people who are our people.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But when it comes to Jesus,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   they narrowed the scope even more.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Why?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Because these people who obey the law
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   look down on other Jews,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   such as tax collectors and criminals.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Although they are all Jews,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   they are all from the same tribe,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   they think their behavior is not correct.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   They may be greedy,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   cheat, defraud, or commit crimes.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   They are greedy.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Although they are Jews,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   they do not regard them as their neighbors.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   They only regard those they love
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   as their neighbors.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   For the foreigners,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   they must be regarded as their enemies.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   So after the fall of the Roman Empire,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Solomon became king.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   After Solomon's death,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   the country was divided into two parts.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Of the twelve branches,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   two branches formed the South,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   that is, the Jewish state.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Ten branches on the north side are the Israeli state.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The southernmost branch is Jerusalem,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   and the northernmost branch is Samaria.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Samaria could not go to Jerusalem to worship,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   so it was buried in the city of Sidon.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   When the Assyrian Empire destroyed the Israeli state,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   they moved the Israelis to different places.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Many foreigners moved to this place.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   The remaining Israelis married the foreigners.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   When they were married,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   they were no longer pure Israelis.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   So the Jews on the south side
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   did not like them.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   They thought they were a group of
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   non-pure Israelis.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   At the same time,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   they worshiped other than the Bible,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   they did not believe in other scriptures.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   They did not believe in religion,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   and they also worshiped other idols.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   After the two countries were divided,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   the Israeli state once helped foreigners
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   to try to attack the Jewish state.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   So the Jews on the south side hate the people on the north side.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   When the Jews could return to build the temple,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   the Samaritans once stopped them from building the temple.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   They wanted to participate.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   In the age of Jesus,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   these two regions were a joint province.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   It was ruled by the Romans.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   But the Jews on the south side
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   did not want to associate with the Samaritans on the north side.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So when they wanted to go to Galilee,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   they often walked along the right side of the Jordan River,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   instead of passing through the Samaritan area.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Because they did not like the Samaritans.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Why did they not like them?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   When the Jews wanted to slander Jesus,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   they insulted Jesus.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   They said to Jesus,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   "We say that you are a Samaritan and a Christian."
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   They added the worst of the two things to Jesus.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   This is how the Jews slandered Jesus at that time.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   So you can see that the Jews at that time
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   were as bad as the Samaritans.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   At the same time,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   there is a record in the Old Testament.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Jesus went to Jerusalem.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   At the end of the journey,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   he passed through a village in Samaria.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   The people there did not receive Jesus.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Because they saw Jesus going to Jerusalem.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   So the people who went there were not our own people.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   At that time,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   when the Jews saw that they did not greet Jesus,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   they asked Jesus,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   "Lord, can you tell us
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   to burn these Samaritans in the sky
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   to kill these people who do not receive us?"
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   So you can see that the hatred was very strong.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Jesus turned to burn these two doors.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   So we see that the Jews and the Samaritans
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   are opposing each other.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Let's look at the first level.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Let's look at the first story.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   At the beginning,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   they had a conversation.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   The pastor,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   according to the background we just saw,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   wanted to debate with Jesus to challenge him
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   to see how much Jesus knew about the Bible.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   He asked, "What can I do to be eternal?"
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   This question is very important.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Why?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   The pastor did not ask,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   "What can I do to be a prophet?"
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   He saw that the most important thing was eternal life.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   So he asked this very important question to them.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Since you are a pastor,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   how do you write the law?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   How do you understand?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   He answered,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   "This is the famous truth,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   to love God and to love the Lord and yourself."
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Jesus said, "You are right.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   If you do this, you will have life."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   This man was not enough.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   He wanted to prove himself right.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   He told Jesus,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   "Who is my Lord?"
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Jesus began to talk about the Samaritan's parable.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   There are different characters in this parable.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   The first character is a man who went from Jerusalem to Jericho.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I just showed you the picture.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   He went from a very high place to the mountain.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   He met a group of robbers.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   These robbers took off his clothes,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   beat him to death,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   and the other man left.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   These sentences are meaningful.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   First, they took off his clothes.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   At that time, clothes were expensive.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It was not like today,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   where you can buy clothes at any time.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   We can produce a lot of clothes at a low price.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   But at that time, we had to work slowly.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   There was no automated machine.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   So clothes were expensive.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   So you can see that
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   when Jesus was nailed to the cross,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   the soldiers took Jesus' clothes.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   They took away a prisoner's clothes.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Because clothes are important when it is cold.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Clothes are not only valuable,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   but also can express your identity.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   No matter what class you are,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   your clothes can reveal who you are.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   For example,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   if this man's clothes are a picture of a priest,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   the priest and the Libyan may help him.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   But this man's clothes were all taken off
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   and beaten to death.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   So we look at these two people in the 31st chapter.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   This priest is a leader of our church in modern times.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   He is a pastor and a religious leader.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   He should be a law-abiding person.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   But he saw this man like this,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   so he walked by and didn't help him.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Then this Libyan,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   in modern terms,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   is a person who participates in the church.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Many people, including our pastor,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   the chairman, the pastor,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and the pastor of the church,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   are all like this.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   When they see this man,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   they all want to walk by.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   It's strange.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Why do these people who are passionate about religion
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   and actively participate in religious activities
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   ignore him?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   There are different ways to spread the word.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Mainly, they give a possibility.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   This possibility is a common point.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   They calculate their own safety and interests.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Why calculate?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Because if they stayed at that time,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   if there was still violence,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   they might be attacked.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   They are not safe.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And if this person was beaten to death,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and his whole body was bleeding,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   if he was electrocuted,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   he would not be vaccinated.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Because they are responsible for serving the church.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   If he was not vaccinated,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   he would have to be vaccinated for seven days.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   He could not go to work for seven days.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   So it would affect their work.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   At the same time, this person was beaten to death.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Even if he was saved, he might not be able to save him.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So he might not have time.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   They might not bother him.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   They just walked away.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   This is actually a very important message.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   No matter how a group of people actively participate in religion,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   no matter their status, no matter their time,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   if we do not have a united heart,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   it is a big problem.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   So Jesus is a rebel.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Although these people have religious rituals,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   but their hearts are not there.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But on the contrary, in chapter 32,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   in chapter 33, there is a person who is the most annoying,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   the most unbearable enemy of the Pharisees,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   the Sanhedrin.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   This person came and saw this injured person,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   and he was moved.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   First, in chapter 34, he used wine and oil to treat the wound.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   He bandaged the wound.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   The first thing he did was to immediately cure the person
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   with the wine and oil.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Then he carried the person to his own body
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   to arrange a guesthouse to take care of him.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   That is, he immediately needed to be cured
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   and then prepared for long-term care.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   He didn't just leave right away.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   He stayed the next day.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Then he took two coins here.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   According to the Bible,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   one coin was the salary of the day.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Two coins were enough to stay in this shop for about two weeks.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   He handed it over to the shopkeeper.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   In other words, in addition to being cured and helped by the injured person,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   he also prepared for long-term care.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   He asked the shopkeeper to take care of him.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   The extra expenses.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The Samaritan did not write on the top of the page
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   how much extra expenses were required.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   He did not mention the top.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   When I came back, I had to pay you back.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   He said he would come back and pay you back.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Then he asked the lawyer
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   who was the victim of the three people,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   the priest, the Samaritan and the Samaritan?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   The lawyer said,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   "He did not mention the Samaritan."
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Maybe he didn't want to see this word
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   because he didn't like this word, didn't like these people.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   But he answered the answer,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   "The Samaritan is the one who died."
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Then Jesus said, "You go and do as you did."
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   This is the first time we have seen the content of the story.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   We can see some information clearly.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Some people are not enough to see death.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Some people we think are enemies.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Instead, he is willing to be loving and active
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   to help those in need.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   He will immediately treat them,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   arrange long-term care,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and even prepare extra expenses.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Then he will come back and see this person.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Let's look at this story and ask a few questions.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   When the lawyer asked, "Who is my adversary?"
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Who is this "I"?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   The lawyer thought he was the priest.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Who needs to be saved?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   In this story, the person from Jerusalem to Jericho
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   may be a Jew.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   But this person needs to be saved.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   The group of people who hurt others are the "strong ones".
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   The people who need to be cared for are religious people,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   priests and laymen.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Although they have religious appearance,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   they are not "the law of God" but "the law of the Lord".
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Who is the "law of God"?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   This is the Samaritan with a "heart of words".
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   He uses his heart to lead people to act.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   He is the "Lunar Stone" because he is the one who writes the covenant.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   He will immediately save and help in the long run.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So if we look at the last sentence,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   "You go to the Lord to act".
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   When we first read this story,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   we may come to a conclusion that
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   you go to the Samaritan with a "heart of words"
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   to write the covenant.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   You go to the Samaritan with a "heart of words"
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   to write the covenant.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   So some priests use the name of the Samaritan
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   to change the name.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   This is the first level of our understanding.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   But in this level of understanding,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   we will encounter several problems.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   What are the problems?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   First, let's look at this passage again.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   The priest asked Jesus,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   "What can I do to be eternal?"
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Jesus replied,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   "You go to the Lord to act."
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Why not "to follow the will of God"?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   This is the first question we need to answer.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Then Jesus Christ said,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   "You go to the Lord to act."
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   What do these three "act" mean?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Why not "to follow the will of God"?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   The second question,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   if we don't pay attention, we have to be careful.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I haven't paid attention to this question for many years.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   The key is that when the priest asked,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   "Who is my disciple?"
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I am him.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   He thinks he is a disciple.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And the disciple is the recipient.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   But after hearing Jesus' words and guidance,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   he said the answer.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   The disciple is the one who is the disciple.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   It's just the opposite.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   At first, he was the disciple,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   and the disciple was the recipient.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Now his answer is,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   "Who is the disciple?"
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   The disciple is the one who is the recipient.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Originally, the disciple is the recipient,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   now he is the recipient.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   His whole cognition is completely reversed.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Why is that?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   So if we stay in the first level of understanding,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   we can't see these contradictions.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Not contradictions, but these characteristics.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Why are they so strange?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Then we have to look at the second level of understanding.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Now I will try to divide the first part into 6 parts.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I will explain the meaning of these 6 sentences one by one.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   First, the priest asked Jesus Christ,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   "Teacher, what should I do to be saved?"
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   He asked a very important question.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Not fame and wealth,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   not how to be rich and powerful,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   but how to have an eternal life.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   He saw that this was the most important thing.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   He asked, "What can I do to bear this?"
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   If we look at the Old Testament,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   it is mentioned that the dead will wake up,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   and the dead will be resurrected.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   After resurrection, there are two results.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Some are eternal,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   some are always humiliated and despised.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   There are two results.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   He asked, "After I die and resurrect,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   how can I have an eternal life?"
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He said this was a very important question for him.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But he said, "What should I do?"
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   So the question is in the question itself.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   What should I do?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Why is this a question in the question itself?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   If you ask the richest person in the city you live in,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   if you go to him and knock on his door and ask him,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   "What can I do to bear your property?"
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   This rich person will kick you out.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Because to bear property is not to do anything for others,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   but to be a person,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   not a descendant of a rich person
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   or his designated successor.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   It's a question of identity, not an issue of behavior.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   So if we ask how to bear eternal life,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   how to enter heaven,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   the only answer is that our identity must become God's will.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's not what I do,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   it's not my behavior,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   but my identity.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   As long as I am God's will,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I can bear eternal life.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   It's not what I do,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   but my status.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   So the question of being is not the question of doing.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   It's the question of status,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   which is being,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   not the question of doing.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   This is the first question,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   the question of making mistakes.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   The question of this young official is the same.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   The question of making mistakes is the same.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   It's not what I do that can earn eternal life.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Eternal life depends on your status.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   The only way to enter eternal life,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   is to enter heaven.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   It can only be a question of God's will.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Let's look at the second sentence.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   After the theologian asked,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   because this is a theologian,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Jesus asked how to write the law,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   how to understand it.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   I just explained that Jesus asked two important questions.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Because you know how to write the law,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   but your understanding is wrong,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   it is also wrong.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   This is the question of Jesus.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   The most wonderful thing about Jesus is his question,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   which made the theologian think again.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   The theologian had prepared the answer,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   when he asked Jesus,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   he had prepared the answer.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   He answered immediately,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I am the God of all life, all power, all love,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and I love you more than myself.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   This answer is different from the one Jesus asked,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   which is the most important one in the world.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Because his question is,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   what do I do to earn eternal life,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   which is not the most important one in the world.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   But Jesus is very wonderful.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Jesus answered him,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   yes, you are right.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   If you walk like this, you will have eternal life.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   It is very strange.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Walk means to walk for eternal life.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Is there any mistake?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Jesus Christ was very direct when he had a dialogue with Nehemiah.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   He did not turn back,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   did not let him think slowly.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   He directly told him,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   God loves all people,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   even gave him his only son to them.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   According to the verse,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   those who believe in Jesus are not like the blind man who has eternal life.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Those who have eternal life have to believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Jesus Christ did not talk to Nehemiah directly.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Why did he not talk to him directly?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   We will see later why he was not so direct.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Because when a person is proud,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Jesus Christ is not so direct.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Jesus answered this question,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   you have to walk like this to have eternal life.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Let's see if we can walk.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   The Greek Apostle Paul clearly said,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   "People are not pure by walking the law,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   but because they believe in Jesus Christ."
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Not by walking the law,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   because no one can be pure by walking the law.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   If you can be pure by walking the law,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Jesus Christ would have died in vain.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   He did not need to die on the cross.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Because we can't follow the law,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   we can't follow the law completely.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   So Jesus Christ would have died on the cross.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   But when the Greek Apostle asked this question,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   he thought from a self-centered perspective.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   He did not think that the Bible was not written yet,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   but we have a copy to see Paul's explanation.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Paul said that Abraham believed in God
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   because he believed in God and was called a man.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   He was called a man because of his faith.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And those who follow the law are under the protection of God.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Why?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Because those who do not follow the law,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   those who obey all the commandments, are under the protection of God.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   It means that even if you can follow a part of the law,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   but you can't follow all the commandments,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   all the commandments are under the protection of God.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   So there is a very obvious reason,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   no one can be called a man by following the law in front of God.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   You have to live by faith, not by doing.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   So the question is,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   why didn't Jesus directly say that he would do it?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Why?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Actually, Jesus' answer is that
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   he hoped that the Greek Apostle would listen to him,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   and if he was sincere, he would answer Jesus.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   He said, "Jesus, I can't do it, I can't follow the law."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   If he was sincere, he would say so.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But he was not only not sincere,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   he wanted to prove himself right,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and then ask another question.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Why did Jesus ask this question?
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Let him know he can't do it.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Let's compare two conversations.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   The first conversation is in Luke 18,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Jesus and this young official,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   the rich official's conversation.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   This person asked him what to do to be eternal.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Jesus told him,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   "You have missed one thing,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   which is to become a poor man,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and then follow me."
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Jesus did not tell him about the righteousness of faith.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Jesus said that he could not do it.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   So this person heard it and knew he could not do it,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   and left with great sorrow,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   because he was very rich.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He loved money more than he loved God.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   In the parable of Samaria,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Jesus asked him to do this,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   that is, to love God, to love himself,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   and then to be eternal.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   This request was also not done by this lawmaker.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Like this young military officer,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Jesus did not fulfill his request.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   He was honest,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   he told Jesus that he could not do it.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   The White House did not do it.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Instead, he had to prove that he was right,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   and then asked, "Who is my messenger?"
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   These two sentences,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   strictly speaking,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   can be used as a topic for a lecture.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Because I recently understood that
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   this sentence is very important.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   I want to explain and prove that
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   I am right,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "Justify himself" means
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   "Justify" means to be called righteousness.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   I want to explain two concepts.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   The first concept is "Justification by Faith".
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   What is "Justification by Faith"?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   God who is righteous
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   announces a righteous sinner as righteousness.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Because this righteous sinner
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   believed in Jesus Christ and his cross.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   So this righteous sinner's sin
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   was added to Jesus Christ.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   He took responsibility for us on the cross.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   At the same time,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   the righteousness of the righteous Jesus Christ
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   was added to the guilty person
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   and was called and regarded as innocent.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   This is "Justification by Faith".
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   What is "Justification by Faith"?
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   In English, it is "Self-Justification".
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   When an innocent sinner announces his righteousness,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   I am right, you are wrong.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   This is "Justification by Faith".
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   When a person wants to prove that he is right,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   this is "Justification by Faith".
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Why do I explain this sentence?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   If we think about our life,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   we are often like this.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Think about when we serve in the church,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   when the brothers and sisters have different opinions,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   we often argue in these discussions.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Everyone tries to prove that he is right.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   A group of sinners to prove that
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   I am right, you are wrong.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   When we are self-righteous,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   when there is a dispute in the church,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   when there is a division in the church,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   we often serve in the church,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   when we are in the family,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   when we are at work,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   when we are with other colleagues,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   we often prove that we are right
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   as a sinner.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   This is "Justification by Faith".
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   So when this Lawmaker
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   is sincere,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   he should say that I can't do this,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   I can't keep these commandments.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   He didn't say that.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   He still has to prove that he is right.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   A sinner in front of God of justice,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   in front of the only righteous follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   has to prove that he is right and Jesus is wrong.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   So he asked Jesus,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   "Who is my shepherd?"
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   This sentence is also very important.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   If we look at it again,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   "Who is my shepherd?"
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   What does it mean?
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   When he can't keep the law,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   if he is sincere,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   he knows that he can't do his best
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   to love God.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   In fact, we can't keep it.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Why?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Every day we get up,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   many times we value our career,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   our family,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and the many things around us.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   We turn our idols into God.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   We often abuse God's name.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Why do we abuse God's name?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   When I call Jesus, "I am my Savior",
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   and I have to follow him,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   my heart and my actions are far from him.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I call Jesus "my Savior",
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   "My Lord, my Lord",
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   actually insulting Jesus.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   I am abusing his name.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Because I don't treat him as my Lord.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   When my heart is far from God,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   I still call him Lord.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I am abusing his name.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   We keep breaking the ten commandments.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   This prophet can't keep the commandments.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   He has to collect the proportion of the proportion.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Because he doesn't love everyone.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   He just wants to love those
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   who are pure and pure.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   To prove himself right,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   he can only love those
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   he chooses,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   or those chosen by God,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   not including the outsiders.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   He tries to love those
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   he doesn't love,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   such as the outsiders and his enemies.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   So if you ask him,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   "Who is my Savior?"
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   The same question is,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   "Who is not my Savior?"
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   I can not love.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   I have to love them.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   If not, I don't have to love.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   So he hopes,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   not to follow the law,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   but to not follow the commandments
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   in some cases.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   He doesn't want to follow the commandments.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   He wants to be certain
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   that he doesn't have to follow the commandments
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   if he chooses them.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Because I don't have to love them.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   So his question is,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   "In some cases,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   how can I not follow the commandments?"
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Or,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   he wants to ask,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   "Who can I not love?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Who can I not love?"
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   He is asking this question.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   So when the Lawyer asked,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   "Who is my Savior?"
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   "I love my Savior."
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   That is, I give my Savior my own grace.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   I am the "I" in the Self-Center.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   I am the "I" in the Self-Defense.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   I am the "I" who is the Savior.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   I don't need help.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   He can't see that he needs compassion.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   He thinks that others need to be graced.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   He is the "I" who is the Savior.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   So I want to share with you a saying.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   A person is difficult to recognize in self-doubt.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   He can't see that he is guilty.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   On the contrary, a sinner
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   who knows his sins,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   like those who follow Jesus,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   the Pharisees, the sinners, the disciples,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   they know their sins and follow Jesus.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   A person in self-doubt,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   no matter how high his status is,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   he can't see that he is guilty.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   So many people today
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   don't think they are guilty and need to find Jesus.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   They think they are a good person.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   OK.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Let's briefly talk about
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   the first part of the sermon.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   The problem of the Law of Correctness and Iniquity.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Because entering the kingdom of heaven
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   is a matter of status.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   It is not an act.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   He knows how the law is written,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   but his understanding is not accurate.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   He can't guard the greatest of these revelations.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   But he doesn't admit it.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   On the contrary, he thinks he needs to
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   narrow the scope of the revelation.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   So he thinks he is a sinner.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Let's look at the second part.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   This is an example.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   The first level,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   I just mentioned,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   I will briefly mention it to everyone.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   The first level,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   the Pharisees,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   they think they are sinners.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   They think the Jews who need to be saved
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   are the people who go to Jericho.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   The strength of the hurt people
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   is not concerned with the people of the church.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   The Pharisees are the ones who are
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   moved by the law.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   They have a heart and action.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   What do we see in the second level?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   In the first level,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   we see these things.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   From the first level to the second level,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   the key point is the question Jesus asked.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   How did Jesus ask this question?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   He said, "Who is the one who fell into the hands of the rapists?"
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   If I compare this sentence
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   to the question asked by the Pharisees,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   the first level of the Pharisees,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   they asked, "Who is my servant?"
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   This is me, himself.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   He thought he was a sinner.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   The servant is the recipient.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Jesus asked him to turn from this perspective
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   to the question, "Who is the one who fell into the hands of the rapists?"
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   The person who was hurt.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Jesus asked this question
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   to turn the Pharisees' self-centeredness
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   from the fact that they do not need to be saved
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and they think they are the recipients
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   to the perspective that they are the victims.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   He thought about this question.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   So this time Jesus was very ingenious
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   to change the perspective of the Pharisees.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   "Who am I?"
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   The Pharisees are no longer
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   the recipients who have the ability
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   but do not need to be saved.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   When Jesus Christ took them to think
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   from this perspective,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   they were the people who fell into the hands of the rapists
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   and were half dead and could not save themselves.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   This is a very powerful change in identity and perspective.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Because he broke the tradition
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   of the Pharisees' misconception.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Jesus Christ had to pull them out of self-doubt.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Why did he do that?
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   In the Gospel of Luke,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   when Jesus Christ called on the Pharisees,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   the Pharisees were the same person who wrote the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   When he asked Matthew to follow him,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Matthew did not say a word and gave up everything and followed Jesus.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   He even had a big feast at home
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   and invited many tax collectors and other people.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   The Pharisees saw this and complained to Jesus Christ
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   why he was with tax collectors and sinners.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   These other people are considered sinners.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   He looked down on these people, although they were Jews.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   He looked down on them and regarded them as the rapists.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Jesus answered,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   "Healthy people do not need doctors,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   sick people need them."
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   This is actually a way of rebuking.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   It is not that these people are healthy and not sick.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   It is that they can't see themselves.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   They think they are selfish.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   They think they don't need other people's help,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   other people's grace, other people's compassion.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   They think they are okay.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   They don't need help.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   They don't need repentance.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   So Jesus answered,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   "Healthy people are these selfish people.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   They don't need doctors or God.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Sick people, these sinners,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   know that there is a sin,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   and the one who knows the sin is easy,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   knows that he is sick,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   and goes to God.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Selfish people
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   can't see the need and think they are healthy.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   So this healthy person is a repudiation.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   A person who repudiates them and despises them.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   And Jesus Christ came to make sinners repent.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   He didn't come to call the righteous.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   These people are not really righteous.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   They are selfish people.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   I am not here to call these selfish people.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   I am calling those who know the sin to repent.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Jesus not only said it once here.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   He also said the same thing in the parable of the lost sheep.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   When I explained the parable of the lost sheep,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   the silver lost, and the return of the wolf,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   this parable of the three-placed one,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   I said that the 99 sheep were not enough.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   At that time, some people understood for the first time.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Because he thought for many years,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   he thought the 99 sheep were fine.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Actually, it was not enough.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Why? Jesus also used a method of rebuke
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   to describe them as "servants who do not need repentance."
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   So the parable of the lost sheep is that
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   when a lost sheep can be found,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   it is equivalent to a sinner repenting.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Heaven will be happy for him.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   It is greater than the 99 servants who do not need repentance.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Those who do not need repentance and are selfish people
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   will be happier.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   So the 99 sheep are not enough.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   The few who get enough are the minority.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Although they are similar to those in the church,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   the minority get enough.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Because when a person is selfish,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   you can't see the sin, you won't admit it.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Today, this is also what we need to be careful about in the church.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Because these scholars are people who read the Bible,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   people who have power in the church,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   people who directly participate in the church,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   but people who do not get enough,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   because they are self-defense.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   So Jesus Christ, in this question,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   from "who is my shepherd"
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   to "who is the shepherd of what people?"
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   "The one in the hands of the powerful."
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   This person is half dead and cannot save himself.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   "The one in the hands of the powerful."
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   He is no longer the sinner who does not need salvation.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   When this perspective changes,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Jesus Christ leads the Pharisees to leave the perspective of self-defense
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   and turn to the perspective of "the one in the hands of the powerful."
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   "The one in the hands of the powerful."
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   This perspective changes and breaks the understanding of the Pharisees
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   to the original of Aaron.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Why?
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   First, now he is the half-dead,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   the one who is deprived and cannot save himself.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   He can't pretend to be healthy and doesn't need a doctor.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   He can't pretend to be innocent and doesn't need salvation.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   He can no longer be a self-willed person who does not need salvation.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   This is the first break.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   The second break is that he used to be a fan of the Samaelites.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   But it turns out that even the enemies can be divided into sects.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   It turns out that the sects are not divided into sects and not divided into races.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   This is the second point to be broken for the view.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Third, for those who bear eternal life,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   the salvation of God is not divided into sects and races.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   It is no longer limited to the Jews.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   The salvation is not only for the Jews,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   but also for all the people of the world,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   as Abraham blessed all the nations.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   The salvation of this savior is extremely generous.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   He does not calculate his own price,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   does not fear the danger,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   does not calculate his own price,
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   but is generous and selfless.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   This is the Samaritan from the heart to the action,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   to carry out this covenant and request.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   When we look at the second level,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   we look at the lawmaker again.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   Now this victim is himself.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   He is a half-dead person who cannot be saved.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   On the contrary, his fellow travelers,
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   his buddies,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   none of them can follow the law.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Both of them left when they saw it.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   This sentence let him know that the religion cannot help us follow the law.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   The religion cannot save us.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   On the contrary, the Samaritan he hates has moved his heart,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   to be immediately healed,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   arrange long-term care,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   even arrange a very generous plan to save and take care of them.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   So when we look at it from a different perspective,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   the answers to these questions are different.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   So we look at this passage again.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   We see that this Samaritan is from the heart
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   to follow the law.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   The Samaritan is from the perspective of the victim,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   to understand the needs of the victim,
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   then to follow the law.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   This is called loving the world and loving yourself.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   He starts from the perspective of the victim's needs,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   not self-doubting,
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   giving what you need.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   He gives immediate help,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   long-term, unlimited help,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   immediate medical care.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   The Samaritan will continue to take care of this person
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   and reward and help the owner.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   So after the second level,
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   we look at the questions just now.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Who am I?
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   I am the Lord, I am the Lord.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   This is the law.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   This time his perspective is different.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   He needs to save the one.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Because Jesus told him,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   you need to save that person from that perspective.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   He is now half dead and unable to save himself.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   He needs to rely on the connection and grace of the Savior.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   What are the people who are hurt?
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Those strongholds.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Who are not concerned?
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   His buddies, his friends,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   priests, hypocrites,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   these religious active participants.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Their behavior and faith are incompatible.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   At the same time,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   all behaviors cannot be guarded.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   If all behaviors are not guarded,
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   they will be saved.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Unless he relies on the grace of God,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   the grace of God.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   Who is the guardian of the law?
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   It is the enemy of the former heart, the Samaritan.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   Because this time from the perspective of the lawmaker,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   this is his enemy.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   But his enemy can guard the law,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   go from the heart to guard the law.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   And this Samaritan is this disciple.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   So if you look at the last sentence,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   you can do it as usual.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   It's almost the same as the first time.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   The only thing is that we have seen through it.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   The lawmaker also needs to be saved.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Okay, if we take the whole story from the third level
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   and expand it to other Bibles,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   we can see who is good.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   Samaritan.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Because it mentions the heart of the Samaritan,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   or some Bibles also called the Samaritan's heart.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   This word is all out.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   New Testament, Old Testament.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   The New Testament talks about Jesus Christ.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Jesus Christ saw those who were suffering from rheumatism,
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   and the heart of the Samaritan.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   He touched them with his hands and healed them.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Jesus Christ saw those blind people who could not see,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   and he touched their eyes with his hands.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   They immediately saw.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   If we look at the last three books,
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   the last sentence is also about Jesus Christ.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   He touched the people who could not see,
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   because they were in trouble.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Jesus Christ saw a large number of people,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   touched them with his hands and healed them.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Jesus Christ called them to come.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   I touched the people with my hands and healed them.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   Because they had nothing to eat for three days.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Jesus Christ said that the Lord touched the people with his hands
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   and released them from their debts.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   So, who is the one who touched the people with his hands and healed them?
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   The one who touched the people with his hands and healed them is the Samaritan,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   the one who released the dead from the body.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   This is our Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   If we look at the Old Testament,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   in the 103rd chapter of the Old Testament,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   God is full of grace and does not show off his face.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   So, the Old Testament talks about the Father.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Jesus Christ is the God who touched the body of the flesh
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   and showed it to the people.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   So, if this Savior is the Samaritan,
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   this Samaritan is Jesus Christ,
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   then we can see that every sentence,
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   there is a meaning in this parable.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   A spiritual meaning.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   For example, he used oil and wine
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   to heal the sick.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   If we look at the picture of Jesus,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   the picture of the Ten Commandments,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   when he was called to repent,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   he drove away many devils
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   and used oil to heal the sick.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   So, oil and wine to heal the sick
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   represents healing.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Then he carried him up to the mountain
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   and took care of him.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   What does "carrying" mean?
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   In the Book of Acts,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   the God told the Israelites,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   "I will carry you when you are born.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   I will support you.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   I will hold you.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   It represents salvation.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   So, the long-term care
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   is to carry you up
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   like a symbol of salvation.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   The Bible says
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   when the God of Egypt took them out of the wilderness
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   and left the land,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   the God said,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   "Your God will carry you
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   like carrying his own son."
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   It means carrying you
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   because I treat you as my son.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   You have the fate of a son.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   You are chosen by God.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   This is the will of God.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Then, I will give you unlimited money.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   I will give you money to take care of the shopkeeper.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   I will give you other expenses.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   It means unlimited money.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Then, I will grant you.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   So, in the Book of Acts,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   Matthew and Luke,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   the prophet will come back.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   Samaritan will come back to see us.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   So, after watching this story,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   if we look at it from a perspective of
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   the repentance of sin,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   this Samaritan is our Savior Jesus Christ.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   He came to us from the flesh
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   and knew that we were in the midst of sin.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   He moved the hearts of the people
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   and used the wine of the right hand to support us,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   to help us, to save us.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   He prepared a place for us
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   and will come back in the future.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   This is the whole story
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   about the Savior Jesus Christ.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   Not only did he ask us to help people,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   the most important thing is who this Samaritan is.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   The Savior Jesus Christ.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   Then, when we look at it again,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   we ask the same question.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   If we go to the third level,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   from a perspective of the repentance of sin,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   to look at this Samaritan,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   who am I?
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   I am the one who is half dead and in the hands of the robbers.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   Why half dead?
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   I was spiritually dead.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   I was not dead physically,
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   so I was half dead.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   I was spiritually dead,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   I was waiting to die physically.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   If I were dead physically,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   I would have been dead.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   I couldn't be saved.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   But Jesus Christ connected us,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   came to save us.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   The Holy Spirit,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   with the Holy Spirit,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   purified our souls,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   so we can wake up.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   We are half dead.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Spiritually, we are dead.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   The Holy Spirit purified our souls.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   We also violate other people's strength.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   Some doctrines say
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   this strength is a devil.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   I disagree.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   We can't blame the devil.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   We can't blame the devil.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   Like Adam,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   when he was in trouble,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   he blamed Eve,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   Eve blamed the snake.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   We commit a crime because of our selfishness.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   We can't be arrogant,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   we can't be indifferent.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   We often violate others.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   We are also that strength.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   Sometimes we are the ones who care about others,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   the priests and the others.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Who am I?
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   I am one of these three types of people.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   We are all sinners.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   No matter how long we have been in the church,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   we remember that we are sinners without cause.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   We still have a sinning tendency.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   We have to rely on God's grace to change every day.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   Who is the Lord Jesus Christ?
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   who came to us from the city of sin
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   and resuscitated us from the sin of the Sinian people,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   So we love God and we love the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   It's like a mirror.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   When we understand how to love God and love the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   we will be able to love the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Who is the Lord Jesus Christ?
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ, who moved the heart of the sinner.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   So the whole story is about the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   not just about the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   who helped those in need.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   who came to us from the city of sin and resuscitated us from the sin of the Sinian people,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   moved the heart of the sinner,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   the Sinian people,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   and saved the sinners on the cross.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   He made all the sinners perish,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   and the sinners be saved forever.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   This is the most accurate example of the Samaritan.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   Why did I say that Jesus Christ is the one who followed the law?
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   Because only Jesus Christ followed the law.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   He can follow the law.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   In the Matthew and the Book of Mormon,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   Jesus said,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   I am not here to abolish,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   I am here to survive.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   The law and the prophets are just old books.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   There are three kinds of law in the Old Testament.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   For example, the Ten Commandments are moral laws.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Only Jesus Christ can follow them.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   None of us can follow them.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   The law of the law of the law,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   that is, the law of the state,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Jesus did not violate.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   The most important thing is the law of the law.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   The most important thing is to limit the lamb,
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   not the sheep.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   It is Jesus Christ.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   This innocent lamb,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   the former prophet,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   is a sheep,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   a sign of the Savior in the future.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   This Savior is the innocent one,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   Jesus Christ, who died for the guilty.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   This perfect lamb,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   the lamb that died for the people,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   the prophet,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   is Jesus Christ.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   So Jesus Christ came to survive.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   In the Old Testament,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   the lamb,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   the lamb of the prophet,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   the prophet that God appointed,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   is Jesus Christ.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   He died for the guilty.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   This is the story.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   So when we see the third level,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   we can see that this is a metaphor for the guilt.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   So when we understand it,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   we know that we live in sin.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   We can't save ourselves.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   We can't take it for granted.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Once we take it for granted,
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   we can't see our sin.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   The life of religion,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   the knowledge of religion,
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   the status of religion
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   can't help us follow the Revolution.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   No one can be born again because of the Revolution.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   We can't rely on our actions.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   We can't rely on our doings.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   But we humans
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   actually treat our Savior as our enemy.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   We nailed Jesus to the cross.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   People are saved
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   because they need the union of the Savior.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   We don't rely on our actions.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   We rely on our identity.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   And the only identity is to be God's children.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   But to be God's children
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   is not to rely on people's actions.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   It's all God's grace.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   It's God's grace.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   God's union.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   We have no credit.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   And God's union.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   The subject of the personal grace point
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   is not divided into nationality and race.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   It includes our Savior.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   So when you like someone enough,
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   don't be unhappy.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   This is what God did in the Bible.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   It doesn't matter if I like it or not.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   On the contrary, God wants me to love my Savior.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   So we need to be able to
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   keep the first commandment.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   First, we need to believe in Jesus Christ
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   and know that we are sinners and repent.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   When you repent,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   you know you have sinned,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   you will be grateful
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   and you will have a response to God's love.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   God loves us first.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   We love God.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Then we have the ability to love others.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   So how do you do it?
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Who do you follow?
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   We follow the Savior.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   This is Jesus Christ.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Our Savior.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   According to his life,
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   his behavior,
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   his style,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   we follow Jesus and live according to Christ.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   This is the meaning of following the way of worship.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   Not just to learn to help those in need.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Those who need it.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   But the level is not the deepest.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   The most important level is
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   to live in the style of the Savior.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Why do we have to follow Jesus?
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   Because faith without behavior is dead.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   If our behavior is not consistent with repentance,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   it is fake.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   We are not really saved.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   Why do we have to follow Jesus?
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Because the reason for God's love is to make us repent.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   And we have God's love.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   Jesus Christ is the glory of God.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   The truth of God's body.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   God is Jesus Christ.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Showing God's holiness to us.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   To follow Christ,
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   we have to write the Bible.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   Follow him in the cross.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   I explained this in the previous video.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   I have to put myself as the center.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   Give up the "what".
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   "What" is the reason for my crime.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   That thing is my sin when I am the center.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   I have to follow Jesus Christ as the center.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   Use him as an example to live our lives.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   Change our values.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   We prepare the cross at any time.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   We have to follow him in this way.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Finally, I want to explain.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   If we want to be saved by faith,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   why do we still have to follow God?
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   Why do we have to love God?
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   Why do we have to love the Holy Spirit?
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   In fact, the whole chapter of Luke 10,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   it emphasizes the status, status,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   that is, the "being" is important,
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   not the behavior.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   If we look at Luke 10,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   Jesus sent 72 disciples to preach the gospel.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   Then they came back very happy and told Jesus,
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   "Lord, because of your name, even the devil has conquered us."
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Jesus told them,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   "Do not be happy because the devil has conquered you."
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   Do not be so happy because of your behavior.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   "But rejoice in the record of your name in heaven."
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   That is, your status is already in heaven.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   This is important.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   So Jesus followed and praised God.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   The Holy Spirit made him happy.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   He said, "Father, the Lord of heaven and earth praises you,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   because you have hidden this matter from the wise and smart people."
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   The wise and smart people are like the philosophers,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   they think they are smart.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   So Jesus did not directly tell the truth.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   Jesus told him something so that he knew,
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   indirectly knew that he could not do it.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   He did not tell him directly.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   He told him that he had to be reborn,
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   to be reborn in water and spirit.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   But for some people who think they are smart,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   sometimes Jesus did not give him a direct answer.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   He indirectly showed him that he was not able to do it.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   He had to rely on God.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   So here is the dialogue between the philosophers and Jesus.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   We are talking about the metaphor today.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   This scripture we see now is that
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   to be eternal, to bear eternal life is a matter of status.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   Only those who are God can be born.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   It is not up to you to be born.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   The last ten chapters are the story of Matthew and Mary.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   Matthew was worried about what he was doing.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   Jesus said, "Mary has chosen the best part,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   this part is the identity.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   The part of God in God, no one can take it away.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   So the whole 10 chapters of Matthew and Mary
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   emphasize the identity of status.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   Heaven is more important than relying on action to enter heaven.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   As a child of God,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   how to do this identity?
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   There have been many explanations.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   In the Gospel of John, it says, "The first of the ages is the coming of the coming of Jesus Christ,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   who will come to our world, and will be with God.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   He is God.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   But those who accept him are those who accept Jesus Christ,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   and those who believe in his name.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   God is like these people,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   power and peace, and the offspring of God.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   So to enter heaven and to bear eternal life,
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   you must have the status of the offspring of God.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   How to have this status?
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Accept Jesus Christ as your Savior,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   and believe in his name.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   This power and peace as the offspring of God,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   this power and peace is like us.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   In the Book of Galatians, it is mentioned that
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   when the time comes,
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   God will cast out his offspring,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   which is Jesus Christ.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   This offspring is born from a woman,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   born under the law.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   He wants to save people out of the law,
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   to protect us from the name of the son,
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   which is Jesus Christ.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   He wants to save us, so we can have the status of the offspring of God.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   God will cast out the offspring of God,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   which is the Holy Spirit entering our hearts.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   In this case, we can rely on God's offspring
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   to bear the fruit of the womb,
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   and to bear eternal life.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   This is God's grace, not our own.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   So Jesus Christ emphasized in his "Prayer to the Gate of the Covenant"
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   that God is like eternal life.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   This "like" is not what we have earned,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   but what God has given us.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   The purpose of God's grace is to make us repent.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   So here, the second chapter of the Book of Galatians
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   says that God's grace is to make us repent.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   And when people repent,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   it means that they know their sins,
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   they know God's forgiveness.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   When we know that we have committed many sins,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   God has forgiven us,
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   we will love God more.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   In the conversation between Simon and Jesus,
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   Jesus led Simon to answer,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   "I want to be merciful."
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   That is, people who have many sins and are merciful
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   will have a greater response to God's love.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   To bear eternal life,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   we have to rely on the Holy Spirit to cause death to our bodies.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   The Holy Spirit leads us.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   We are not completely
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   by the grace of God.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   But after we are saved,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   we rely on God, on the Holy Spirit
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   to help us to cause death to our bodies.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   In our holy mind,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   we walk from sin to righteousness
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   until we see the Lord.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   And when we are willing to walk this path,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   we are actually the children of God.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   Only the children of God have the Holy Spirit to guide us,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   to help us walk from sin to righteousness.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   So why do we have to follow the Covenant?
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   The Covenant is not given to those who have not been saved.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   If we look at the Old Testament,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   God first saved the Israelites with Moses,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   and then issued the law.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   It was not given to the law to save them,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   the law was first saved,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   but God saved the Israelites,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   and then issued the law to them.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   So people cannot rely on the law to be saved.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   Why do this?
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   Because the law is given to those who have been saved.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   How to guard?
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   It is to be transformed by the Holy Spirit,
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   so that we can follow the law of God.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   So why do we have to follow the law?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   Not because the law can save us,
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   but the law helps us to learn
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   the Holy Spirit, justice and good.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   Why? The Old Testament is very clear.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   In the 7th chapter of the Old Testament,
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   it is mentioned in the 12th chapter,
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   "The law of God is the Holy Spirit,
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   and the Covenant is the Holy Spirit, justice and good."
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   So when God first saved the Israelites,
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   after the Israelites were saved,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   the law helped them to learn
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   what is the Holy Spirit, justice and good.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   We are the same.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   The law of God is not the way to be saved.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   The way to be saved is to follow the law.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   And when we follow the law,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   God gives us the Holy Spirit,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   so that we can love others.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   Why? Because in Matthew,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   there is a passage that is easy to be misunderstood.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   In the 7th chapter of the Book of Mormon,
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   "You pray, and I will open the door for you.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   You seek, and I will build. You beg, and I will open the door for you."
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   Many people see this sentence and say,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   "I have a long list of things I want,
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   but I have to ask God for this and that."
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   But actually, this passage is not like that.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   It is not like we want to ask God for what we want.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   What is it about?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   In the 11th chapter,
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   "Although you are evil,"
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   we should pay attention to this sentence.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   Jesus Christ told the believers,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   "Although you are evil,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   but you know that the good things will come to you.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   And the Father in heaven will not
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   give the good things to the people who seek Him."
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   What is this good thing?
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   In the Book of Mormon,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   it explains that this good thing is
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   "the spirit of God will not be able to reach those who seek Him."
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   We pray,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   not for a list of things we want to ask God for.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   We pray for the spirit to enter our hearts
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   and help us to die for our sins.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   So that we can...
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   So, how do you want to treat people?
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   How do you want people to treat you?
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   How do you want to treat people?
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   Love people as yourself.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   That is, we pray,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   ask God for the spirit to fill us.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   Pray for us to love others as we love ourselves.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   Love others as we love ourselves.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   This is the general meaning of the law and the prophet.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   So here, this "give, give, give, give, give"
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   is for others, not for ourselves.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   We pray for the spirit,
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   pray for God to give us the spirit to fill us.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   Pray for us to obey God's teaching
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   to love others as we love ourselves.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   That's what it means.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   But this door is narrow.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   So, finally, I will use the example of the eight books.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   The eight books are eight kinds of qualities,
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   not the conditions of salvation.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   These eight books have been reborn,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   have been reborn by the Holy Spirit,
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   the qualities of the salvation of the Christian.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   They are from seeing their own sins,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   knowing that their souls are in need of God,
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   and feeling sorrow for their sins.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   Then, because we have nothing,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   everything is dependent on God's grace,
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   we become gentle,
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   not to compete with others.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   We are unselfish,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   love God's work,
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   we love God.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   Then, because we have the grace of God,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   we also have the grace of others.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   We love others.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   We don't calculate.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   We are unselfish.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   We live with people and God.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   We don't calculate ourselves.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   Like this priest and this Limei person,
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   they calculate their own safety,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   their own benefits.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   They believe in God and don't consider their own benefits.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   They are peaceful,
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   love others, including their enemies.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   In the end, they are even forced to do evil.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   So, it is a life of turning to righteousness.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   From believing in repentance,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   to changing our mind,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   to changing our behavior,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   this is a way of life,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   to learn the way of Christianity.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   I will use this picture to explain
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   the difference between "grace, faith, and righteousness" and "guarding the cross".
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   Before we were saved,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   I drew two roads here.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   This is a narrow road,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   this is a wide road.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   Before we enter the narrow road of heaven,
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   we cannot rely on our behavior.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   We enter heaven to believe in the grace of Jesus Christ,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   to save us from our sins,
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   to be moved by the Holy Spirit.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   So, we pray for the Holy Spirit to move us,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   to let us know our sins,
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   to accept our sins,
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   to understand God's love for us.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   Then we can have a response,
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   repentance,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   life change, behavior change,
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   and accept Jesus Christ as our Savior.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   Because God loves us first,
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   we are forgiven,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   we can love God,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   and have a response to God.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   God loves us first,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   we can love God,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   and love people.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   We need the Holy Spirit to revive our sins,
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   so that we can follow the way of Christ.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   Before entering this road,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   we need to clear this step,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   we cannot rely on our behavior,
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   it is completely God's grace,
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   it is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   After entering this road,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   this road is eternal,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   we walk to the end of our lives,
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   this holy road.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   So we are not done yet.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   We have cleared the path,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   no longer under the law.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   So we have to follow the law,
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   we have to work hard to walk this path.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   Work hard not by our own ability,
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   work hard is to follow the Holy Spirit,
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   to die for the evil of the body.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   We must live,
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   because the spirit of the devil is actually the work of God.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   So when we enter this path,
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   we will make mistakes,
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   we will turn from sin to righteousness.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   In this process,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   in this path of holiness,
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   in this growth,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   we are not perfect.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   We cannot rely on the law,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   but we have to follow the law,
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   because the law helps us to learn
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   the righteousness of the Holy Spirit.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   We are no longer under the law,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   even if I make a mistake,
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   I will not be judged by the law,
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   because I am under the grace of God,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   Jesus Christ has paid the price for my sin.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   In this process,
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   we continue to change our thoughts and ideas,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   from sin to righteousness,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   live in the way of Christ,
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   change our behavior and life,
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   and walk out of our faith and life
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   in harmony with one another.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Then we can love God,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   love the Holy Spirit.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   We are not perfect,
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   but with the help of the Holy Spirit,
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   we will gradually die for our sins,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   from sin to righteousness,
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   walk this path until we see God.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   This is the path of salvation for the sheep,
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   the sheep of the sheep.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   The most dangerous is this path of sheep.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   This path of sheep is also uncertain,
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   but it is very close to this narrow road.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   These sheep think they are with the sheep,
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   they are also saved.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   But on the day of judgment,
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   they suddenly wake up,
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   they are not saved,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   because they do not repent of their sins,
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   repentance includes changing thoughts and ideas,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   life is a way of change,
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   that is repentance.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   Today, many people, even those in the church,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   we know our sins, but we do not repent.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   We live in the same church,
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   it is very possible that we are walking on a path of life,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   so everyone must be careful,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   reflect on yourself.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   Finally, I want to explain,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   this sentence is said by the Bible,
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   "The Lord who loves you wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly,
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   and loves himself and the disciples."
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   Why do we have to do so many things?
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   There is a reason.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   Because when Jesus Christ corrected the Jews
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   about the concept of loving the disciples,
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   he told us,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   "You not only love the disciples you love,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   but also worship your enemies and pray for them.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   If you do not do this,
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   you are still just tax collectors and patriots,
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   you are not the children of God.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   Because God is complete, you have to learn from him.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   Learning from him does not mean you are complete.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   We are on this holy path,
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   we have to learn from him.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   That is, we cannot stay in sin,
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   we should always stay in the Lord's love.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   Even if we are still in sin,
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   we should be determined.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   We should respect God,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   love God, and start to live in the name of God,
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   to change our lives,
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   to die for our sins,
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   to walk that path.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   But we have to learn to follow the law,
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   to learn to learn the love of the Holy Spirit.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   Because the Lord we will meet in the future
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   is the Lord of the love of the Holy Spirit.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   We have to learn how to learn the love of the Holy Spirit.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   Because he has already given us the law,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   taught us to walk this path.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   So you do it like a talent.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   The talent is to follow Jesus Christ.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   So we follow Jesus Christ,
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   live in Christ.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   So loving the disciples is not a condition to enter heaven.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   It is a life performance of a blind man who has been reborn.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   Why do we have to be wholehearted,
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly?
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   Because we are enemies.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   We cannot rely on our feelings.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   I don't want to.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   I don't want to.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   But God teaches us to support with will.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   When I don't want to,
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   we know God calls us to love our enemies.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   Because we love God.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   My will tells me to do my best.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   I will do it with my life.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   So why do we have to be wholehearted, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly?
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   Will is the will.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   When I don't want to, my will tells me to do my best.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   I will do my best.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   The same sentence is said in the Gospel of Luke.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   When Jesus Christ explains how we should love our enemies,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   he says, "If you love only those who love you,
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   what good is it?
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   Sinners love those who love them."
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   Sinners will do the same.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   If we only love our enemies,
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   we are no different from sinners.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   Our identity is also a sinner,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   we are also a patriot.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   And for those who have been reborn,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   we have to pray to God to help us to love our enemies.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   If we are not wholehearted, we have to be wholehearted
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   to love our enemies.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   This is very difficult.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]   We have to love, not to hate.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   So why do we have to be wholehearted to help us to love our enemies?
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   Because my heart is not necessarily,
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   but my will tells me to be wholehearted.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   Our heart has to love.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   Because when we are willing,
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   we are the will of the Savior.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   So he said, "For God has his own good and evil,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   you have to be like him,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   follow Christ,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   follow Christ,
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   follow Christ,
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   love God, love the Holy Spirit, love your enemies."
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   I will share with you today.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000]   If you have any questions,
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   because there is no time for answering this time,
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   I would like to invite you to comment below my YouTube channel.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   I will answer your questions as much as possible.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   God bless you.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   OK, bye-bye.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   [END]
