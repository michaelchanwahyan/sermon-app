00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
各位弟兄姊妹,早晨

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
金吾國在中文大學已經做了四年的校長工作

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
由第一年開始,牧師說原來校長是要來講道的

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
我都很欣然地接受了這個邀請之後

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
已經過了四個年頭

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
剛才坐在祭壇上,看看這個禮拜堂

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
看到你們很特別的儀式

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
慢慢地打開窗簾

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
看到十字架在灰藍色的天空上出現

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
我心裏覺得中大是一個很特別的大學

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
因為不是很多大學真的有一個可以完整的禮拜堂

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
有上帝明顯的祝福和祂的存在

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
剛才聽到師伯唱一首很美麗的歌曲

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
牧師還告訴我原來這首歌是一位會友

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
彈琴的弟兄所作的

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
我一直聽的時候覺得好像天使的聲音在這房間裏不停地旋轉

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
所以我想邀請你們幫我給他們一點掌聲鼓勵一下

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
我知道平時師伯唱詩很少會有人拍手

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
但是我覺得也不介意將來在天堂上

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
如果天使唱得好的話,我也會拍手

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
但是其實每一次來這裡分享聖經

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
我都很大的負擔,很大的心理上的重擔

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
因為我經常都說

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
我不是一個正正式式接受過神學訓練的人

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
雖然我從中學的時候開始一直都有上教會

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
但是聖經的道理

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
我相信我是只能夠很膚淺地去了解

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
而且我發覺在香港今時今日

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
說話是越來越困難的

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
每逢我講一句說話都可以有很多種不同的演繹

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
甚至乎在網上說話,這樣含一聲

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
竟然都會在報紙上看到

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
或者說我沒有說過的

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
都會在WhatsApp上傳了一篇假的說話

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
其實我連WhatsApp都沒有的

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
所以要在廣壇上去分享一些訊息

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
一些教訓

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
我一方面覺得我需要坦承的是

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
真的把我自己的看法,我的領受

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
上帝給我的說話和你分享

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
但是另一方面,我又很怕

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
一些說話在今天香港一個很撕裂的社會裏面

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
會產生又有另外一些的

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
不知道怎樣的爭拗和演繹

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
但是今天這段說話我覺得真的非常貼切

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
是值得我們每一個人

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
無論你是讀書的

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
或是你已經做事的

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
無論你信主是很短時間

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
或者是已經很多很多年

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
無論你是贊成正改的

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
還是不贊成正改的

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
我都覺得這一段說話

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
只要你是一個基督徒

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
它都應該會在你的心裏面起到一些作用

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
其實大家都很熟悉的一段聖經

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
其實剛才我們讀過一部分的

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
或者我再幫你們再讀一次出來

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
羅馬書的第十二章

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
我決定會由第一節到第三節

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
不是第二節,讀多一節

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
由第一節到第三節為大家讀出來

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
所以這裡說,弟兄們

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
我相信一定包括姐妹們

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
我以神的慈悲勸你們

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
將身體獻上當作活祭

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
是聖結的

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
是上帝所喜悅的

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
你們如此侍奉乃是理所當然的

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
不要效法這個世界

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
只要心意更生而變化

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
叫你們測驗何為神的善良

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
純全可喜悅的旨意

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
我憑著所賜給我的恩

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
對你們各人所講

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
不要看自己過於所當看的

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
要照著上帝所吩咐各人信心的大小

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
看得合乎中道

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
三句很熟悉的聖經

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
帶出三個很重要對於我來說

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
我希望對於你來說

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
很重要的訊息

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
或者我先用Eugene Peterson的聖經的譯本

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The Message

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
讀一次給你聽

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
看看你覺得這樣的解釋

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
會不會又給你有另外一個的看法

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
他說So here what I want to tell you

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
God helping you

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Take your everyday ordinary life

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're sleeping, eating, going to work

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And walking around life

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And place it before God as an offering

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Embracing what God does for you

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is the best thing you can do for him

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
第二節

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't become so well adjusted to your culture

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That you fit into it without even thinking

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Instead, fix your attention on God

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You will be changed from the inside out

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Redly recognize what he wants from you

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And quickly respond to it

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Unlike the culture around you

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Always dragging you down to its level of immaturity

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
God brings the best of you

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Develop well formed maturity in you

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm speaking to you out of deep gratitude

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For all that God has given me

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And especially as I have responsibility

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In relation to you

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Living then

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
As everyone of you does in pure grace

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It is important that you not misinterpret yourself

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
As people who are bringing this goodness to God

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
God brings it all to you

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The only accurate way to understand ourselves

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The only accurate way to understand ourselves

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Is not by what God is

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And by what he does for us

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Is by what God is

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And by what he does for us

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Not by what we are

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And what we do for him

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
三句好像本來我們都好熟悉的聖經

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Eugene Peterson亦都好長好長

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
但係加左一啲我從來都冇諗過嘅一啲元素喺裏面

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
我同大家分享一下

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
第一句大家都好熟悉嘅

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
佢話我哋要將身體獻上當作活祭

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
係聖結嘅

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
係上帝所喜悅嘅

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
blablabla

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
好似好抽象咁樣

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
都唔知乜嘢叫做身體獻上當作活祭

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
呢度呢講到好簡單比你聽

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
無論你瞓覺你食飯你工作

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
你跑步你搭車

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
每一個生活嘅部分

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
你都要將佢變成咗

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
係你對神嘅一種嘅奉獻

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
對信你嘅上帝嘅一種奉獻

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
信仰唔係禮拜日朝頭早先至出現先至發生嘅

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
係你每一日嘅生活

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
甚至乎好似好唔同信仰好冇關係嘅嘢

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
你嘅食飯你同人講說話嘅態度等等

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
都成為你對上帝嘅offering

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
究竟我做唔做到呢一點呢

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
我記得我以前喺醫院裏面工作嘅時候

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
我非常之有信心

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
非常之enjoy

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
非常之享受我喺醫院裏面嘅工作

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
所以我從來都唔會朝早要期完土先返工

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
但係自從做咗大學校長之後

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
我朝朝都期咗土先返工

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
你千祈唔好畀我見到啲記者問我啲唔知點樣答嘅問題

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
你千祈唔好畀我見到有班學生喺我門口抗議緊呀

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
等等等等

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
因為我知道我每一日所做嘅每一樣嘢

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
作每一個嘅決定

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
甚至乎講每一句說話都可能係可以侍奉神

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
但亦都可能係可以侍奉自己

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
甚至乎係破壞咗一啲嘅學校裏面嘅嘢

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
不過呢個唔係我最想同大家分享嘅

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
最想同大家分享嘅係第二句

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
本來我想將呢句聖經用作今年開學禮嘅演詞嘅

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
不過後尾覺得都係敏感得滯結果我轉咗

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
呢句聖經點樣講呢

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
佢話唔好效法呢個世界

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
要心意更生而變化

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
叫你哋察驗乜嘢係上帝嘅善良

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
純全可喜悅嘅旨意

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
嘩!英文呢亦都好精彩

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
佢話唔好so well adjusted to the culture of this world

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
今日嘅culture係乜呢?

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
我哋今日生活係香港

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
今日嘅香港嘅culture係乜呢?

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
今日香港嘅culture

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
我覺得有幾樣嘢係好明顯嘅

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
第一

181
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
我哋嘅年青人越希望事事都係好如意

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
每一樣嘢都係好順利

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
不太需要花費太多嘅努力

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
或者係辛勞

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
我講一個事實畀你聽

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
你知唔知道喺中文大學我哋嘅課程裏面呢

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
要讀英文有兩個級數嘅

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
一個係淺啲嘅

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
一個係深啲嘅

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
咁我哋入嚟嘅學生呢都係有唔同嘅英文程度

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
有啲係國際學校嚟嘅

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
有啲係本地學校

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
有啲英文考五星星嘅

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
有啲英文考唔係五星星嘅

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
咁但係呢

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
但係呢

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
有一日我收到一封嘅投訴信

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
啲學生話

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
啲英文課程淺到呢離哂譜

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
我做咩要讀啲咁嘅英文呢?

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
教埋啲嘢呢

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
中學五年班都不如

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
咁我睇下係咩真係有啲咁嘅事咩

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
咁我就問下啲英文老師

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
喂!我哋啲英文係咪真係淺得好交慣呀?

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
佢話其實唔係㗎

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
我哋有兩級㗎

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
佢哋可以揀深啲嗰個課程

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
可以揀淺啲嗰個課程

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
不過就算英文考五星星嗰啲人

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
都會揀淺嗰個課程嘅

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
因為個分數會高啲

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
同埋佢就算唔返學

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
佢都可以攞到好高分

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
其實代表住咩呢?

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
就係代表住分數係代表一切

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
最好嘅呢

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
就係唔需要付出努力

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
都可以攞到好嘅分數

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
如果你問有啲學生坦白咁樣同你話

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
喂!點解你揀呢課?

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
即係唔淨只係英文

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
譬如你讀Economics

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
點解你揀呢一個課

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
唔揀嗰個課

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
呢個容易啲嘛

227
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
呢個呢個先生會放水㗎嘛

228
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
呢個呢會考試實高分㗎嘛

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
咁我GPA咪唔會跌囉

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
咁我哋係揀容易嘅

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
今日我哋成日都同啲年輕嘅醫生

232
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
喂!點解你揀做呢一個課嘅?

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
唔揀嗰個課嘅

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
我哋喺醫學上而家

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
有四個課係最受歡迎嘅

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
叫做成功之路

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Road to success

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
R呢係代表X光嘅

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
放射科

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
即係坐一度咁睇嘅嘢

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
O呢係代表Opermology

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Opermology 眼科

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
眼呢其實就算點樣呢

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
都唔會急到夜晚係要起身嘅

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
就算飛咗一啲嘢入去隻眼球裏面

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
聽日攞同今晚攞返出嚟都係一樣嘅

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
所以唔使半夜要當間要起身嘅

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
A係麻醉科

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Anesthesiology

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
就係你麻醉咗嗰個病人之後

251
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
咁個外科醫生就喺度開刀

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
你就喺度睇緊明報周刊嘅

253
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
對唔住呀我講笑

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
希望唔會有麻醉科嘅醫生喺度

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
D係Dermatology 皮膚科

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
其實真係翹埋手望下

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
香港腳

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
但係你唔使夜晚黑

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
冇皮膚嘅嘢係急到夜晚黑要起身嘅喎

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
真係你有冇諗呀你咪行咪拗住先囉

261
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
但係你使唔使夜晚黑叫個醫生話

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
你即刻嚟呀我真係行到唔掂呢

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
咁好少㗎嘛係咪先

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
所以原來 Role to success

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
對於我哋嘅年輕嘅醫生呢

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
就係要舒服㗎啦

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
搵到錢嘅

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
同埋夜晚唔使起身嘅

269
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
仲要喺醫院裏面升職升得快嘅

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
呢啲呢

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
就係今日我哋嘅心態

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
成功係唔需要太過辛苦

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
唔需要付出代價

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
第二個我自己好覺得

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
今日嘅Culture

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
呢個世界係咩呢

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
就係我

278
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
係世界嘅中心

279
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
我係最重要嘅

280
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
喺一年前到呢

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Time magazine

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
即係時代雜誌

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
有個封面

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
咁就有個女仔攞住一個電話

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
影緊自己嘅Selfie

286
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
By the way Selfie已經入咗牛津

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
呢個大字典呢個字啦

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
即係自拍呢個字呢

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
已經係呢個風氣呢

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
已經係好普遍

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
其實我都有做過呢啲自拍嘅嘢

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
不過係爭咗未人買個支棍返嚟

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
咁樣督住嚟都係自拍

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
但係呢一個

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
咁嘅動作

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
其實係代表咩呢

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
係我自己好鍾意我自己

298
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
我食嘅每一餐飯

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
我著嘅每一件衫

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
我去過嘅每一個地方

301
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
我都幫自己拍一張相

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
其實係下意識地呢

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
根據呢一個時代

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
我集資嘅呢一個封面嘅故事呢

305
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
下意識地呢

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
人覺得我係

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
最可愛嘅

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
我係最緊要嘅

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
我嘅權利

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
係遠超過其他人

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
嘅權利

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
我點解

313
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
畢咗業之後買唔到樓

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
我點解搵唔到一份

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
五點半後放到工

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
但係又可以

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
夜晚黑又一個

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
生活質素嘅晚上

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
我點解

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
要去做呢樣

321
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
要去做嗰樣

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
個個自我嘅中心

323
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
係今日呢一代

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
好明顯嘅

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
一部分我相信係因為

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
好多嘅家庭都得一個細路角

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
佢

328
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
起碼就係佢嘅屋企嘅

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
中心

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
佢嘅爸爸媽媽

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
佢四個嘅祖父祖母

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
所有嘅attention

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
都擺晒喺佢哋嗰度

334
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
我哋細個嗰陣時

335
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
好多家庭都有四個

336
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
仔女五個

337
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
啲媽媽就會話

338
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
讀書讀呀

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
讀唔到佢學師啦

340
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
係咪呀

341
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
食飯你咪食囉

342
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
唔食夠鐘我咪執桌囉

343
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
唔使追住九條街去

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
餵你飯嘅喎

345
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
今日我哋嘅細路角

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
我哋嘅下一代

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
實在我哋關顧得

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
愛護得非常之周到

349
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
以至慢慢慢慢形成咗一種嘅

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
感覺我

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
係世界嘅中心

352
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Egocentricity

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
自我中心

354
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
我相信呢個都係我哋今日

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
睇見嘅一個幾明顯嘅現象

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
第三個更加明顯

357
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
第三個

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
就係特別係香港

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
係一個

360
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
批判嘅文化

361
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
係一個互相批評嘅文化

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
每一日你打開

363
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
報紙

364
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
由第一版一路去到後面

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
其實充滿住係

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
手指

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
互相指責

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
企喺道德嘅高地

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
然之後其他嘅人

370
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
都係錯嘅

371
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
其他嘅人呀佢又

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
做咗

373
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
我而家真係好小心講嘢

374
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
佢又

375
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
做咗某某樣嘢

376
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
結果第二日

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
畀人發現佢自己又做咗一樣嘢嘅

378
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
咁我都出聲啦

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
咁但係呢啲咁樣嘅

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
指責嘅風氣

381
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
使到我哋成為咗一個

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
真係好

383
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
互相敵對

384
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
好互相嘅不饒恕嘅

385
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
一個嘅社會嘅環境

386
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
令到

387
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
有人話呢如果你唔住

388
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
喺香港你睇

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
只係睇香港嘅報紙呀

390
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
你覺得呢個係一個地獄嚟嘅

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
但如果你住喺香港但你唔

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
睇香港嘅報紙呢

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
你覺得呢度係天堂嚟嘅

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
咁最慘我哋又住喺度

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
又睇下報紙咁就兩頭都唔到岸

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
我哋每一日

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
就充滿住

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
互相嘅批評

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
互相嘅指責

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
佢話唔好跟住

401
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
呢啲潮流呀

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
唔好跟住

403
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

406
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

408
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

410
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

411
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

412
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

413
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

414
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

415
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

416
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

417
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

418
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

419
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

421
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

422
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

425
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

429
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

430
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

433
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

434
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

435
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

436
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

437
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

438
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
唔好跟住呢啲咁樣嘅潮流

439
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
因為一件事就即刻判斷咗是與非

440
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
眼光放長一啲

441
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
眼光放長一啲

442
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
想深入,想長久

443
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
想深入,想長久

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
想從不同角度

445
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
然後再經過我哋自己嘅思考

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
想從不同角度

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
揾出你覺得呢個係是定係非

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
揾出你自己應該企嘅位置

449
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
揾出你自己應該企嘅位置

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
我相信呢個就係聖經所謂嘅

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
我相信呢個就係聖經所謂嘅

452
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
成熟嘅一個嘅重要嘅

453
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
成熟嘅一個重要嘅

454
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
因素

455
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
最近寫字嘅時候

456
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
寫到蘇東坡嘅

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
一首詩

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
橫看成嶺,側成峰

459
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
遠近高低

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
確不同

461
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
各不同

462
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
不知廬山真面目

463
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
紫園身在此山中

464
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
紫園身在此山中

465
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
我初頭覺得無乜特別

466
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
因為山經常有霧掩蓋住

467
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
但後來我諗下諗下唔係

468
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
其實望一個山真係咁嘅

469
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
你咁樣望呢

470
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
八線有八個嘢嘅

471
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
但係打側望都唔係喎

472
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
原來尖個一舊嘢咁樣過

473
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
喎

474
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
沙士嘅時候我完全明白呢件事

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
當我哋喺醫院裏面我哋見到

476
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
唔係喎呢個病明明

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
係出面帶入嚟嘅喎

478
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
但係

479
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
係出面嘅社區或者

480
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
政府裏面又覺得呢個病係

481
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
醫院傳播出嚟嘅病

482
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
高低遠近高低

483
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
確不同

484
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
但係我哋其實都係處喺

485
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
喺呢個嘅山上面

486
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
只不過我哋從不同嘅角度

487
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
所以唔好太快下判斷

488
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
唔好太快去定別人嘅罪

489
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
唔好太快嘅去批評別人

490
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
唔好太快嘅去批評別人

491
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
成竟話點解你睇到自己

492
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
睇到人哋眼中嘅一條刺

493
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
但係睇唔到自己嘅良目呢

494
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
點解你唔去諗下

495
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
其實你都唔係一個完美嘅人呢

496
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
你都有犯錯嘅時候呢

497
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
成竟又話凡係

498
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
要得到生命嘅

499
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
就喪掉生命

500
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
但係凡係為我喪掉生命嘅

501
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
就必定得到生命

502
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
我哋係咪真係自我中心到

503
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
我都係屬於我嘅

504
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
係我自己

505
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
我係自己

506
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
我係自己

507
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
屬於我嘅

508
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
我係最重要嘅

509
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
反而有時候我哋放開

510
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
可能會

511
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
得到上帝嘅祝福

512
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
因為凡係放開你嘅

513
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
去

514
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
能夠喪掉自己嘅生命嘅

515
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
就必定得住著生命

516
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
第三節

517
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
呢度亦都好精彩

518
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
頭先講咗你唔好做啲咩嘢

519
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
唔好跟住呢個世界

520
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
唔好要效法

521
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
呢個世界嘅culture

522
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
點先叫成熟呀

523
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
點先叫好呀

524
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
佢呢度就話

525
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
佢話我哋憑住各人

526
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
得到嘅恩典呢

527
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
唔好睇自己

528
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
過於

529
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
所當看嘅

530
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
要照住神所分

531
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
畀你嘅信心大小

532
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
看得合乎中度

533
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
呢度呢就令我

534
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
或者我

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
再解釋埋英文嗰個嘅解釋

536
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
佢話呢你唔好成日喺度諗

537
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
我可以

538
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
我係點樣點樣嘅偉大

539
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
我能夠做啲咩嘢

540
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
我點解香港

541
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
唔可以係成為

542
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
一個世界嘅

543
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
頂級嘅城市

544
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
點解我哋唔可以影響

545
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
全中國

546
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
其他嘅地方

547
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
包括咗政制經濟

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
等等各方面

549
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
我哋係最

550
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
好嘅最偉大嘅

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
城市

552
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
但係反轉頭嚟諗

553
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
其實我哋係咪有少少

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
自我中心呢

555
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
係呢一個咁樣嘅

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
諗法你係唔係太過角度

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
太過從我自己

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
出發呢呢度話佢話你唔好

559
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
fix your attention

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
喺你自己嗰度

561
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
focus on

562
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
God

563
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
you will then be changed from

564
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
inside out

565
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
redly recognize

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
what he wants and

567
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
respond to it

568
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
God brings the best

569
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
out of you

570
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and you will have well

571
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
formed maturity in you

572
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
佢度話呢

573
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
你唔係世界嘅

574
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
中心

575
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
我哋只係上帝嘅計劃嘅裏面

576
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
嘅一個好少嘅部分

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
一個nano particle

578
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
一粒沙

579
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
你唔係世界嘅中心

580
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
中文大學唔係

581
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
世界嘅唔係香港嘅中心

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
香港唔係

583
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
一定係中國嘅中心

584
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
唔係世界嘅中心

585
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
我哋

586
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
只係身處喺歷史

587
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
嘅裏面一個點

588
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
我哋喺呢個點

589
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
裏面只係一個人

590
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
上帝先至係

591
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
嗰個掌管

592
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
歷史嘅上帝

593
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
先至係掌管一個國家

594
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
要點樣發展一個城市

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
要點樣發展

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
咁我嘅責任係咩呢我個責任

597
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
就係observe

598
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
去睇下佢要擺我係咩嘢嘅位置

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and recognize

600
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
佢要我做啲咩嘢

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and respond to it

602
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
所以唔係由我嘅角度去出發

603
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
一定係要咁樣

604
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
樣嘅去做

605
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
當我哋面對今日嗰個嘅

606
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
爭拗今日嘅困難

607
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
嘅時候我哋成日都去問

608
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
點解香港會變咗咁樣嘅呢

609
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
我哋嘅前途又會

610
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
點樣嘅呢

611
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
成日都會聽到人哋話

612
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
真係唔能夠盡如人意

613
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
人生不如意嘅事

614
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
常八九

615
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
好多好灰心嘅說話

616
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
點解我做唔到呢樣點解我哋

617
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
會變咗咁樣嘅一個地方呢

618
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
突然間呢句聖經將我擺咗喺

619
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
一個大啲嘅picture

620
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
嘅裏面我哋只係

621
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
一個

622
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
七百萬人嘅城市

623
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
只係一點

624
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
而喺歷史嘅裏面

625
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
中國嘅歷史嘅裏面我哋只係五千

626
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
幾年嘅文化嘅裏面嘅

627
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
一點

628
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
中國都只係一個全世界嘅

629
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
人類嘅歷史

630
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
同埋喺上帝創造嘅呢一個嘅天地嘅裏面

631
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
亦都只係一點

632
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
所以

633
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
或者我哋應該去問

634
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
我

635
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
喺一個嘅位置

636
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
你擺我喺呢一個嘅

637
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
時代

638
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
你擺我喺呢一個嘅工作嘅崗位

639
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
你擺我喺呢一個嘅家庭

640
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
你

641
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
要我點樣去做呢

642
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
不可自視過高

643
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
唔可以覺得我係

644
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
世界嘅中心

645
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
呢個係

646
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
我喺呢句聖經裏面

647
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
所領受嘅說話

648
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
唔好誤解自己

649
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
佢話

650
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The only accurate way

651
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
唯一一個準確嘅方法

652
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
去understand ourselves

653
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
去明白我哋自己係乜嘢呢

654
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
就係

655
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
by 睇下上帝

656
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
睇下上帝喺我身上

657
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
做咗啲咩嘢

658
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
睇下佢賜咗啲咩嘢畀我

659
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
而唔係對返轉頭睇下

660
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
我有啲咩嘅成就

661
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
我係配得到啲咩嘢

662
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
喺我過去嘅

663
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
工作嘅經驗嘅裏面

664
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
都有幾次呢係

665
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
其實不停咁反省令我

666
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
覺得呢樣嘢係真嘅

667
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
由處講返2003

668
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
年嘅SARS當我哋

669
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
完全冇辦法去控制

670
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
嗰個嘅疾病

671
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
用晒所有嘅藥之後

672
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
我哋都唔能夠見到

673
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
第一個病人好啲咁樣

674
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
我就喺

675
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
3月嘅

676
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
中旬即係當呢個嘅爆發

677
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
出現咗嘅大約十日之後

678
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
就

679
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
call咗一次叫

680
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
全個內科部門嘅醫生入嚟我嘅辦公室

681
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
去一齊為嗰啲病人祈禱

682
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
咁我嗰日先知道

683
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
原來我哋個部門係咁多

684
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
基督徒嘅我個辦公室

685
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
太細根本連坐

686
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
企都冇得企

687
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
嚟咗差唔多20個醫生

688
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
我哋

689
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
大家都頭疼疼

690
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
唔知道點樣嘅去

691
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
為佢哋祈禱

692
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
我哋只係知道呢

693
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
就快會有人死㗎喇

694
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
如果再唔見到

695
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
有轉機嘅話呢

696
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
第一個醫生

697
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
如果係犧牲咗

698
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
其他嘅人呢就會即刻

699
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
變得更加嘅驚慌

700
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
然之後好多人會走佬

701
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
好多人會唔肯返工

702
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
當時喺個房間入面

703
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
對住20個同事

704
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
要為出面嘅病倒

705
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
咗個同事同埋

706
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
其他嘅病人祈禱嘅時候

707
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
冇人出聲

708
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
咁我就

709
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
作為部門嘅主任

710
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
咁我就第一個祈禱

711
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
我話上帝求你唔好讓我嘅無知

712
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
讓我哋嘅無能無知

713
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
係令到我哋

714
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
喪失咗一條嘅生命

715
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
好係第一次

716
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
我用無知嚟到去形容我哋自己嘅醫學嘅能力

717
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
跟住講完呢句說話之後

718
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
成間房啲人都喺度喊

719
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
因為大家真係覺得

720
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
已經去到我哋嘅能力嘅盡頭

721
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
我係真係無知

722
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
我都唔知究竟對付緊個乜嘢病

723
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
我都唔知嗰隻virus係乜嘢

724
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
唔知乜嘢藥

725
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
唔知乜嘢嘅情況

726
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
先至用呢啲藥

727
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
或者幾時要用呼吸機

728
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
無知

729
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
當人嘅方法去做

730
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
咁我都唔知

731
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
當人嘅方法去到盡頭嘅時候

732
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
就係上帝嘅能力嘅開始

733
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
由果日開始

734
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
我相信唔係一個巧合

735
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
我哋開始見到

736
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
我哋嘅同事同埋我哋嘅病人都好返

737
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
第二次我

738
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
覺得係

739
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
完全無助嘅時候

740
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
就係

741
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
當我上任

742
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
或者未上任之前

743
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
要接受

744
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
師生校友

745
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
嗰個嘅

746
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
咨詢

747
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
唔係質詢

748
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
當時

749
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
係烽火台上面

750
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
坐咗我

751
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
同埋一個嘅

752
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Professor Dennis

753
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
學生事務處嘅主任

754
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
同埋學生會嘅會長

755
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
台下面就有幾百個

756
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
同學

757
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
救生

758
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
後面呢有

759
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
十幾二十個

760
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
電視台

761
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
好多記者攞住長鏡

762
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
去影

763
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
有線電視直播新聞台

764
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
都黎埋

765
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
然之後

766
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
用咗三個鐘頭嘅時間

767
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
就好似考試咁樣

768
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
去問我

769
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
對於學校整體嘅發展

770
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
有啲咩嘅睇法

771
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
然之後

772
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
最高峰

773
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
最呢一個

774
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
戲肉嘅地方呢

775
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
就係有位同學

776
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
預備咗舊嘢

777
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
擺咗喺個烽火台上面

778
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
用一塊紅色嘅布

779
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
咁住

780
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
然之後佢話我哋對於上一任校長

781
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
非常不滿

782
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
所以我哋而家有個鐘

783
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
倒數佢仲有幾多日

784
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
請你為我哋揭開呢一個鐘

785
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
(笑)

786
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
面對一個

787
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
完全我冇諗過嘅

788
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
遊戲

789
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
冇諗過嘅一個挑戰嘅時候

790
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
我心裏面

791
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
又再一次嘅祈禱

792
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
話上帝呢個真係

793
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
我真係唔識做呢啲咁嘅嘢

794
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
我做醫生嗰陣時候係我講

795
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
嗰個人聽我話嘅

796
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
而家呢個個人係度問緊嘢

797
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
我又唔知點樣去回答

798
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
我真係唔知道點樣嘅去做

799
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
我求你畀我應該

800
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
講嘅說話

801
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
求你畀我知道應該點樣嘅去應對

802
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
當時就心裏面

803
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
就有一個聲音佢話

804
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
你就應該

805
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
按住你嘅良心

806
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
去做你應該做嘅事啦

807
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
如果佢哋唔歡喜你嘅話

808
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
咁你咪唔使做校長囉

809
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
咁你就唔好做囉

810
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
真係有個咁嘅說話

811
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
我心裏面走咗出嚟

812
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
於是乎我同個位

813
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
挑戰我嘅同學咁樣講

814
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
我話我哋無論

815
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
幾唔鍾意以前嘅

816
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
校長作為一個讀書人

817
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
作為一個知識分子

818
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
我哋都唔應該用

819
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
一啲方法嚟到去

820
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
侮辱佢嚟到去

821
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
攻擊佢所以話我

822
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
對唔住我就唔會揭開呢一個嘅鐘

823
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
如果你鍾意嘅話你就自己去揭開啦

824
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
當時我嘅反應

825
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
我期待嘅

826
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
台下嘅反應係

827
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
一股嘅虛聲

828
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
大家都會話你都唔係

829
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
幫我哋呢邊嘅

830
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
你都係建制嘅

831
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
但係

832
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
結果個反應就係台下

833
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
一片嘅掌聲

834
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
原來

835
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
當我哋

836
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
用自己嘅良心

837
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
去做返啲

838
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
應該良心應該要做嘅事

839
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
或者放低自己

840
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
個個人嘅榮辱

841
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
你唔要我做我咪唔做囉

842
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
咁嘅時候上帝係

843
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
會掌管嗰件事嘅

844
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
發生上帝係

845
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
會有個計劃嘅

846
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
in fact呢件事呢

847
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
第二日喺報紙裏面

848
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
都報導得幾廣泛

849
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
跟住呢

850
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
嗰位本來叫我去揭呢個鐘嘅同學呢

851
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
今日成為咗個區議員

852
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
但係佢同我變咗好路友

853
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
佢冇嬲咗我

854
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
係

855
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
其實佢都幾尷尬嘅你諗下

856
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
佢有個鐘叫人哋揭

857
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
人哋唔揭下面嗰啲人拍手喎

858
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
即係佢本來係

859
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
應該好

860
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
威水㗎嘛點知佢好似比人哋

861
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
係柴褪台咁樣

862
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
但係佢竟然同我

863
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
請我食咗一餐飯

864
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
我哋大家一齊傾個計

865
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
我都覺得你應該

866
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
唔好揭嘅呢個鐘

867
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
佢先至係掌管

868
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
呢間大學嘅

869
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
佢先至係掌管香港嘅

870
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
發展

871
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
佢先至係掌管呢個世界嘅歷史

872
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
所以今日嚟到

873
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
香港嘅爭拗

874
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
嚟到我哋嘅

875
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
改變

876
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
弟兄姊妹

877
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
佢先至係嗰個嘅住宅

878
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
我哋唔需要太過

879
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
灰心

880
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
我哋又唔需要太過

881
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
擔心

882
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
其實我咁樣講呢係

883
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
即係你如果認識我你就知道

884
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
我真係唔應該咁講

885
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
因為我係好灰心我係好擔心嗰種人嚟

886
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
我同自己都講緊

887
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
唔好太過擔心唔好太過灰心

888
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
因為我哋只係

889
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
恆河

890
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
沙嫂裏面嘅一點

891
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
一粒佢有佢嘅計劃

892
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
佢嘅能力

893
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
係遠超過我哋可以

894
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
想像佢嘅道路

895
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
喺深海之中

896
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
至於我哋

897
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
就真係要常常記住呢句說話

898
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
要效法呢個世界

899
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
總要心意更生

900
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
而變化

901
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
叫你哋察驗

902
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
乜嘢係上帝嘅善良

903
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
純全可喜悅嘅旨意

904
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
願上帝祝福中文大學

905
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
祝福香港

906
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
亦都祝福你哋每一個

907
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
亦都希望你有一個美好嘅中秋節

908
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
多謝

909
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
多謝

910
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
多謝

911
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
多謝

912
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
多謝

913
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
多謝

914
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
多謝

915
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
多謝

916
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
多謝

917
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
多謝
