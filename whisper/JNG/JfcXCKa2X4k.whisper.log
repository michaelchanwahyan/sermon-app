[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Hello, brothers and sisters.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   Welcome to my teaching today.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.500]   Today I would like to share with you a topic called "Truth and Miracles".
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.000]   This topic is in Matthew 12, verses 22-42.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   In my last sermon, Jesus Christ asked me a question.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   "Have you ever read the book of Matthew?"
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   The last sermon was in the first third of Matthew 12.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Today's sermon is in the middle third of Matthew 12.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   First, please listen to the text I read today.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Matthew 12, verses 22-42.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   It says, "At that time, a man led a blind and naked man to Jesus.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Jesus healed him, and Abba spoke and saw.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   The people were amazed and said, "Is this not the Son of David?"
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   But the Pharisees heard and said, "This man speaks of the devil,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   because he is wearing the robe of the devil.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   "A nation must be united by self-interest.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   One nation must be united by self-interest.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   If Satan drives out Satan, it is a matter of self-interest.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   How can his nation be united?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I am wearing the robe of the devil.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Who are you wearing, you sons of the devil?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   They will be your judges.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I am wearing the robe of the devil.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Then the kingdom of God has come to you.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   How can a man enter the house of his enemy and take his possessions?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Unless he first binds the enemy,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   otherwise he cannot take his possessions.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Those who do not follow me are against me.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Those who do not repent with me are in the desert.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So I tell you,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   all sins and blasphemy can be forgiven,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   but blasphemy cannot be forgiven.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But blasphemy against the Son of Man cannot be forgiven,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   The second paragraph is in verse 33.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You know what is good and what is bad.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Because you see what is good, you know what is bad.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You are the wicked.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   How can you speak good words?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Because the mouth of the heart is full of good words.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Good people speak good words from the good he has spoken.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Evil people speak evil words from the evil he has spoken.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I tell you, all the idle talk that people speak
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   must be brought to justice on the day of judgment.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Because if it is up to you, you will be just.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   But if it is up to you, you will be guilty.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   At that time, there were several people from the city of Valley of the Word who said to Jesus,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   "Teacher, we want you to show us a miracle so that we can see it."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Jesus answered them,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   "The evil generation of man seeks to see the miracle.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Except for the miracle of the prophet Jonah,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   there is no miracle that they can see.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Jonah was in the desert for three days and three nights.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Similarly, the Son of Man will be in the earth for three days and three nights.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   At the time of judgment, you will be given the sin of the world.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Because you have not heard the prophecy of Jonah,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   it will be changed.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   See, the greater is the law than Jonah.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   At the time of judgment, the queen of the south will rise and set the sin of the world.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Because she came from the earth,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   she will hear Solomon's wise words.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   See, the greater is the law than Solomon.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Today I want to share this scripture with you.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   The last time I talked about the scripture,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I mentioned Jesus Christ's invitation at the end of Matthew.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   He said, "Those who bear heavy burdens, come to me.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I will give you rest.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I am gentle and humble in my heart.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You should learn from me.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So that your hearts may be comforted.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   For my burden is light, and my burden is light."
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   In the last lecture, I divided the first one-third of Matthew 12
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   into three parts.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The main point is that Jesus' disciples were
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   accused of breaking the Sabbath by the Pharisees.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Jesus quoted David and Zizek to point out
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   that he is the eternal King of Kings,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and the eternal Great Zizek.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I also explained the focus of the Sabbath.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The first point is that it doesn't matter what we can do or not do.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   The most important thing about the Sabbath is that there are two main points.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   The first point is that the grace of God allows people to have a rest.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   The second point is that when we have a rest,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   we can get close to God, know God, worship God,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and reconcile with God.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   This is the most important.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   The real rest is to reconcile with God.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Because people are separated from God by sin.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Sin makes us unable to go directly to God.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   To truly rest, Jesus Christ as a Great Zizek,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   and as a God who has no sin,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   to atone for sin and solve the problem of sin.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   So Jesus Christ used his own
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   cross to shed blood for us,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   to bring us into the real rest,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   which is to reconcile with God.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Also in the second chapter of the Bible,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   in chapters 9-14, Jesus healed a man whose hand was dried.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   The Pharisees did not doubt the ability of Jesus to perform miracles.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But they knew that Jesus Christ could perform miracles,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   but they did not respect him.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Instead, they hoped that Jesus would heal the man on the Sabbath,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   as a weapon to accuse him,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and even to kill him.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The author of Matthew 1, Sittu Matthew,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   quoted Isaiah 42,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   which says that Jesus Christ is the Lord chosen by God.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   He came to suffer,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   to heal and help many in need.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   At the same time, he also brought this good news to the outside world.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   This is what happened in the prophecy of Isaiah.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Sittu Matthew pointed out that Jesus Christ is the Lord chosen by God.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   He is the Savior, Isaiah.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Today we will continue this passage,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Matthew 22.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   If you look at the three chapters in the middle,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I will divide them into three parts to explain.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The first part is about the Pharisees slandering Jesus
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   by using the king and the disciples to drive out the devil.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   The second part is about the example of the tree and the fruit.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   The third part is about the Pharisees asking Jesus to perform a miracle again.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I want to emphasize that the miracle I want to talk about today
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   is a miracle that can be seen with the naked eye.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   For example, Jesus healed the man and drove the devil away.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   These are visible to the naked eye.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   All that God does can be regarded as a miracle.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   For example, the change of a man's mind and thoughts
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   from sin to righteousness is also a miracle.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   But the change of the inner heart cannot be seen.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So the miracle I want to emphasize today is a miracle that can be seen with the naked eye.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   For example, the miracle of turning water into wine,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   healing the sick and driving away the devil, etc.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So I want everyone to understand.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   First, let's look at the first passage of the Bible.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   This passage is very special.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It is a very concise passage.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   At that time, someone brought a blind and mute man to Jesus.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Jesus healed him.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   The father could speak and see.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   There are three things in this passage.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   First, this man was blind and mute.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Jesus healed him, that is, drove the devil away.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   This blind and mute man could speak and see.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   When this happened, no one doubted that Jesus could perform a miracle and heal the sick and drive away the devil.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   When everyone noticed, there were two reactions.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   The 23rd chapter says, "Everyone was surprised.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   "Isn't this David's son?"
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So the first group of people who saw this miracle pointed to this man.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Could it be the Savior, Lezariah?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Because in the Old Testament, when it comes to David's son,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   it often refers to the future Savior in the Old Testament.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Lezariah means Savior.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   David's son.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Because the Old Testament says that the Savior of Israel is David's son.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So David's son represents the Savior of Israel in the future.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   At the same time, another group of people, the Pharisees, saw this.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   They said, "This man drove the devil away.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "Is it the devil, the king, the shepherd?"
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   So today we want to see what evidence there is in the two names David's son and the Pharisees.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   So that these people have two different ideas.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   So the same thing happened, this miracle happened.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   No one doubted that it would be meaningful to Jesus to perform a miracle.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   The difference is pointing to which two people.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   One is pointing to Lezariah, the Savior.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   The other is the king of the devil.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   First, we have to look at David's son.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Because in the Old Testament, there are several obvious things that will happen.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   First, the deaf will hear the words of the book.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   The blind can see.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The poor will rejoice because of the Lord's Word.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And the poor will be happy because of the victory of Israel.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I want you to pay attention to this.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   When Isaiah mentioned Lezariah,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   it was to cure the sick.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   But there is a purpose.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Because the deaf can hear is a method.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   It's not over yet.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   The real purpose is that the Savior came
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   to let the deaf hear the words of the book,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   which is the Word of God.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The blind can see.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Who can see?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   God.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So when Lezariah came,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   the Savior came,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   he was a miracle worker.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   But this miracle worker is not the purpose.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   This miracle worker took away the deaf who knew God.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   He wanted them to have a chance to hear God's voice,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   to know God.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   So the miracle worker itself is not the purpose.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It's a method, a means to make people who are disabled,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   who have broken bones,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   can hear God's voice,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   can know God.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   So Isaiah mentioned
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   the blind, deaf, blind, deaf,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and mute can be healed.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So the Bible just mentioned
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   the blind can see, the mute can speak.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   So it is very concentrated to put these points
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   to the people at that time.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   When they think of the Old and New Testament,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   they see Jesus doing this miracle,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   healing a blind man, a deaf man.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Even he saw in Isaiah,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   the old man was set free,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   the blind was set free,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   a man tied up by a curse was set free.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   So Jesus Christ was set free for him.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So when these three things come to mind,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   they immediately think of the things
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   mentioned in the Old Testament,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   the things that will happen in the language of Isaiah.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So their inferences are consistent.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So in addition to knowing this Savior,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   they use the word "David" to describe.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Because the Bible also mentions
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   the Savior is David's descendant.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   In Samuel 2,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Samuel tells David,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   "When your harvest is satisfied,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   you will be born again."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   That is, after David dies,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   there will be a descendant behind you
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   to contact you.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   "This man will build a temple for me,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   and I will firmly establish his kingdom
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   until forever."
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   It is obvious that David's descendant
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   who built the temple for him
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   is not Solomon.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Although King Solomon
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   took David as king
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   to build the temple for him,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Solomon's kingdom is not eternal.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So the kingdom is eternal.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   So it is not Solomon,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   but the future Savior,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   David's descendant.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   In Exodus 11,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   it is mentioned that
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   this descendant is Isaiah's descendant.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Isaiah is David's father.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   It is especially emphasized that
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   this Savior has the spirit of Jehovah
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   bound on him.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   This spirit is intelligent,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   resourceful, and capable.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   It is the spirit of Jehovah.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   In Jeremiah,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   it is especially mentioned
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   that this Savior
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   will build a temple for David.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   He must have the power of king.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   He is intelligent,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and does justice on earth.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   This is the truth.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It is especially mentioned that
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   this Savior's name
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   will be called Jehovah,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   our second.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   If we look at the Old Testament,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   we may not be able to explain
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   what "our second" means.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   But if we explain it from the New Testament,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   we will understand much more.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Why do we need to look at Paul's explanation?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Because before Paul saw the resurrection of Christ,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   he was a Christian who persecuted the Christians.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   So he understood the thoughts of the Pharisees.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   He understood the thoughts of the Pharisees
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   when they were saving the world.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   But when God came to him,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   he explained the Bible of salvation for us.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   What does this "second" mean?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   If we look at the Roman book of Paul,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   when he compared Adam and Christ,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   he explained this in great detail.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   He said,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   "Just as sin comes from a man into the world,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   death comes from sin."
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   This sin will lead to death.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   This man is Adam.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Then he said,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Adam is the image of the man who will come in the future.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   The man who will come in the future is Christ.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   The Bible says that he is the second Adam.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   The first Adam committed a crime once,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and everyone was convicted.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Just as Christ, the second Adam,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   committed a crime once,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   and everyone was cleared and was saved.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   The first Adam committed a crime once,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   and the whole world was convicted.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   The devil is the authority in the air.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   The world is controlled by the devil.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   But when Christ came,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   he called those who were willing to accept Christ
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   to be cleared and be saved.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So he mentioned in verse 21,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   "Just as sin comes from a man into the world,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   death comes from sin."
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Just as the second Adam is in charge of the second Adam,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   who is this second Adam?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   It is Jesus Christ.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   So this second Adam is mentioned in the Old Testament.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   The second Adam is the son of David,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   the son of David,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   the son of David,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Jesus Christ.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   So we see that the people at that time
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   saw Jesus speaking in a blind,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   open-eyed, and mute way,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   and thought that this is the son of David.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   It is very normal, there is a basis.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   But the second Adam,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   the Pharisees said that
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Jesus Christ relied on the ability of the disciples.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Who are the disciples?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   The disciples are the Jews who laughed at the devil's name.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   The meaning of disciples is the people of the eagles.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   They thought that a large group of eagles
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   would stick to the disciples.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   The disciples are the people of the eagles.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   It is a very defiant and insulting name.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   But I read the whole Old Testament,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I tried to find it,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   there is no passage in the Bible that mentions
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   that it can be driven by the power of the devil.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   The whole teaching of the Old Testament
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   mentions that it can be driven by the power of God.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And the teachers of Judaism
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   also use the power of God to drive the devil.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   So there is no record that
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   it can be driven by the power of the devil.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So when I was translating this scripture,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I only know this part,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   that is, the almost baseless accusation
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   is to slander Jesus.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   So the Pharisees,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   although they knew that they could see Jesus
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   was able to drive the devil and heal the sick,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   they slandered Jesus
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and said that he was driven by the devil to heal the sick.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   After hearing this, Jesus used two answers
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   to prove that what they said was not reasonable.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   The first answer was that
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   if each person disputes with each other,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   he cannot be satisfied.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   The second answer was that
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   if Jesus Christ relied on the devil to drive the devil,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   then who did the teachers of Judaism rely on to drive the devil?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Because in Judaism,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   they also use the power of God to drive the devil.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So these people will judge the Pharisees
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   to slander Jesus.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   These two answers are actually very clear.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   But I want everyone to pay attention to the first sentence.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Jesus knows their thoughts.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   This sentence is actually very important to us.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   So I don't want to explain it in the following sentence.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Because I want to explain this sentence first.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Jesus knows their thoughts.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   It is mentioned many times in the Bible.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   For example, Jesus mentioned in John 2
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   that Jesus did a lot of miracles at that time.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Many people believed in his miracles.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   But the Bible says that Jesus did not give himself to them
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   because Jesus knew their hearts.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   If Jesus knew their thoughts,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   today Jesus Christ also knows your and my thoughts.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   What is special about this?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   This sentence reminds us
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   not to stupidly think that God does not know what we think.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Many times we know that God is everywhere.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   God's light shines into our inner heart.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   God's words tell us
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   what is right, what is wrong, what is good, what is evil.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   But if we spend a lot of time
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   hiding in a dark corner,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   in the final abyss, thinking that God does not know,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   we are like a fool.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   This is a great crisis and a great stupidity.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   So this sentence reminds us
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   that Jesus Christ sees our inner heart.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   God knows our inner heart at any time.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So we should not deceive ourselves
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   to pretend to be blind, to pretend to be deaf, to pretend to be mute,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   to hide in a dark world.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   If we do not want God to be with us,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   no matter what we see,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   no matter what we think,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   it is not good.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   We must leave it immediately.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   We must try to worship our God every moment,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   to do His good deeds.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   If we do not want God to be with us,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   we must avoid it immediately.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   So I hope you will pay attention to this sentence.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Jesus used these two answers
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   to tell you that the accusation that Jesus
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   was cured by the king of devils is not reasonable.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Jesus then said two very important words.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   If I rely on God's inspiration,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   then God's kingdom will come to you.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   How can a man rob his things in the house of a priest?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Unless he first binds the priest,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   otherwise he cannot rob his house.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   As I said, Paul explained the Old Testament.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   He said, "Our righteousness" is Jesus Christ.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   This is the second Adam.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   The first Adam committed a crime.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   He entered the world and people had to face death.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   The second Adam is Jesus Christ.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Jesus Christ did not commit a crime.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   As a living sacrifice, as a sacrifice without sin,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   as a priest, he was atoned for us.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   It became two different eras.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   It is mentioned here that Jesus Christ relied on God's inspiration.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   This sentence is very important.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Because when Jesus Christ came to the temple,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   he was restricted by many bodies.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   He was tested like you and me.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   But he relied on God's inspiration to face the test.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   So when he came out to serve,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   he was led by the Holy Spirit to the wilderness
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   to face the test of the devil, the test of the truth.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Jesus Christ also relied on God's inspiration to cure the disease and drive away the devil.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   He relied on God's inspiration to do the work of the Father.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   So Jesus Christ showed us how we should rely on God's inspiration to live our lives,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   face our difficulties, face our tests,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and how to serve God, to do God's work.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   We should rely on the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   This sentence is very important.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   When the Holy Spirit came, the divine vision came.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   It means that in the first Adam's chapter,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   people were bound by the bondage of sin.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Now Jesus Christ's coming is like entering the house of the priest.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   This priest is the house of the devil.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   In the house of the devil, everyone is bound by sin.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   When Jesus Christ came, he pointed out that he wanted to release this person.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   He wanted to rescue us from the house of the devil.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   This is the meaning of the second chapter, chapter 29.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   The divine vision has come.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Because Jesus Christ has come, he has the ability to release us from sin.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Because the divine vision can release us from sin.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   At first we are free.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   This is the meaning.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   In the last lecture,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   St. Matthew quoted the second chapter, chapter 40,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   where it is mentioned that the Father gave the Holy Spirit to the Savior.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   The Father gave the Holy Spirit to Jesus Christ,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   the man of the holy line,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   and passed the work to the outside world.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   This is the meaning.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Then Jesus Christ also said,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   "Those who do not follow me are against me;
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   those who do not repent with me are in division."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   It means that people cannot be neutral.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   They cannot be neutral in front of God.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Not only cannot be neutral, but also have to participate actively.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Because he said, "Those who do not follow me are against me."
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   It means that either you are with me or not.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   There is no middle ground.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   We should not have the illusion that
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   "I listen first, let's go to church and listen first."
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's okay.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   If you do not repent with me,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and do not decide to admit that Jesus Christ is your Savior,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   you are still a devil.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Do not lie to yourself that you are not a devil.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   The Bible says it clearly.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   If you are not with God, you are with the devil.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   There is no middle ground.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Do not think that you have a neutral position.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   There is no such thing.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   The second area is that Jesus Christ said personally,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   "Do not repent with me."
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   It means that you do not participate in the service with me.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   It is a division of sin.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   So we cannot be neutral.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Either with God or not.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   When we are with God, we have to be active,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   all in, to serve God, to worship God.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   This is the teaching of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   As the Columbus Preface says,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   "In the Adam, all people died."
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   That is, we are two paths.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   In Christ, all people have to be resurrected.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   In the Adam, those who have a life are healed.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   But the Adam behind,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   that is, Jesus Christ,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   is the Spirit that is like life.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Jesus Christ is life.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   The truth of life.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   He is the source of life.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   God like life.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   So who do we follow?
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Do we still stay in this life of death?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Or do we follow Jesus Christ who can bring us back to life?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Paul tells us that this is not a difficult choice.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Jesus Christ, because these Pharisees
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   knew that he could heal a hand of dry skin,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and that Jesus Christ could heal the devil,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   not only did he not come to the Lord,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   but he also insulted Jesus by using the devil to heal the devil.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   So Jesus Christ said a very serious thing.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   He said, "All sins and sins of the world can be forgiven,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   but the life of sin is not forgiven.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   All that is said about the dry skin of man can be forgiven,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   but that which is said about the dry skin of the Holy Spirit
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   is not forgiven in this life and the next."
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I believe many Christians are worried
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   whether the things I have done will be in vain
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   and I will not be forgiven in the future.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   First, I will explain this passage.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   This passage is the same as the 10th chapter of Matthew,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   which mentions two times that Jesus Christ performed a miracle.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   The first miracle was the hand of a dry-skinned man.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   They knew that Jesus could do it.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   They were waiting for him to do it on the day of rest,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   so they could sue him for violating the day of rest.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   They deliberately went to sue Jesus,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   and even wanted to murder Jesus.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   This time Jesus cured the sick and drove away the devil.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   They knew Jesus had the ability.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   They did not deny Jesus had the ability,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   but they did not admit that Jesus came from God.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   On the contrary, they even insulted Jesus
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and said that Jesus was driven away by the devil.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   We need to think about what is so important about the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Why is it that the dry-skinned man,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   that is, the dry-skinned man Jesus Christ,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   cannot be the Holy Spirit?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Let's look at the first chapter of the Bible.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   When Peter wrote this book,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   he wrote it to the Christians.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   He said, "Jesus Christ's disciples Peter wrote to Lazarus,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   who was chosen."
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   It means that all Christians are chosen by God.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It is not we who choose God, but God chooses us.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   So everyone understands that it is not us.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   We are originally dead in the midst of transgressions.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   When we are dead in the midst of transgressions,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   we have no response to God's words.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   It is God who awakens our souls,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   so that we can respond to God's words.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So today, many people do not believe in God.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   It is normal for them to not respond to the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Because their spirituality is dead.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Just like our spirituality was dead on that day.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   If it were not for God's grace,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   through the Holy Spirit,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   our souls were awakened and responded to God's words,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   we would not have responded to God's words.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   It is mentioned here that
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   which Christians are chosen by God?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   According to the precepts of the Father,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   "By the Holy Spirit, we are made holy."
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   "Made holy" means to be divided into holy.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   "Divided into holy" means to be divided into holy.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   "By the Holy Spirit, we are made holy."
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   "Divided into holy" means to be divided into holy.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It means that a person who is made holy by the Holy Spirit,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   will be made holy by Christ in his heart,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   and Christ will be the Lord of your life.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   "And we are made holy by Christ."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   What does it mean?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   In the Old Testament,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   the priest would pour the blood of sheep and cows
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   on the people who were made holy.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   It means that the blood of these people covers your sin.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Jesus Christ died on the cross,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   the blood of cows covered our sin.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   What does it mean?
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   What kind of person are these Christians chosen by God?
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   They are foreknown to God.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   They are made holy by the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   The Holy Spirit is the agent.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   It is the one who makes us holy.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   It means that it is the one who makes us holy.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   It means that we are made holy by Christ.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   It means that we accept the blood of Christ to cover our sin.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   It means that we admit our sin.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   The blood of Christ is like a cloth of justice.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   A cloth of justice and dignity covers our sin.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   It is not that we are good,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   but the righteousness of Christ covers us.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   It means that we are made holy.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   So the most important part of the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   is to make our souls holy.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   In John's Gospel,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   when he explained in detail,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   the Holy Spirit comes to make the world to be guilty,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   to be doubtful, to be judged,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   to be self-conceited.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   When the Holy Spirit of truth comes,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   it will lead us to enter or understand all the truth.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I mentioned before that
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   when people are in sin,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   our values are completely crazy.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   We put the wealth of righteousness
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   above the creation of God.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   We even do not admit the creation of our Lord.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   We completely reverse many values.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   The work of the Holy Spirit
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   is to reorganize our crazy values.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   It is to make us to be guilty, to be doubtful, to be judged.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   It is to make us to know that we are guilty,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and to know how to punish ourselves.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   When the Holy Spirit lets us know our sin,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   and renew our souls,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   it will slowly lead us to the Word of God
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   to teach us to understand the truth.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   So if a person has not been reborn by the Holy Spirit,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   it is meaningless to transmit the Gospel to him.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   No, it is not meaningless.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   He has no response.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And his no response is normal.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Because his spiritual God has died.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Unless the Holy Spirit leads people to transmit the Gospel,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   and the Holy Spirit has entered his heart,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and reorganized his values,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   and led people to know the truth,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   then people can know God.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   So the Gospel today is to exorcise the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   to exorcise the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   It is not to say that when we Christians commit a sin,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   we will be in a state of guilt
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   and we will not be able to repent.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Because when you are still worried that you have committed a sin,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   and you will offend the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   it means that you still have a heart of reverence for God.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I want to emphasize one point.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   When a Christian truly repents,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   in theory, the Holy Spirit is in his heart.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Some Christians will think,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   if the Holy Spirit is in my heart,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   and I have committed a great sin,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   such as adultery,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   will the Holy Spirit commit a sin with me,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   and I will be a sinner to the Holy Spirit?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Will the Holy Spirit be a sinner to me?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   If you think like this, it is wrong.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   If a Christian really commits a sin,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   it is you who commits a sin,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   not the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   The Holy Spirit is watching you commit a sin.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   The Holy Spirit is watching the Christian commit a sin with a sad look.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   The Holy Spirit will not commit a sin.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   So don't get it wrong.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   If we commit a sin, it is we who commit a sin,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   not the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   So you have to understand the first point.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   So if you are still worried about making mistakes,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and you want to honor God,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   you don't have to worry about committing a sin.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   This is the background of the verse.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   The Pharisees knew that only God's power could cure the disease and drive away the devil.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   But they refused to admit it,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   and even insulted Jesus Christ.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   So the sin of the Holy Spirit and the sin of the dry food of the Holy Spirit
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   has several conditions.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   First, they knew that God was there.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   They didn't do it unknowingly.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Many people didn't believe it,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and they said, "If you call Jesus, I will believe it."
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   This is because they did it unknowingly.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Think about it.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   A Christian who believes in Jesus Christ
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   would not dare to call Jesus Christ.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   So for those who don't know God,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   they won't commit this sin.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   The content of this verse says that those who know God,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   deliberately refuse God,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   even deliberately humiliate God,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   refuse the guidance of the Holy Spirit to die in fear.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   These people are people who have been poisoned by the Holy Spirit,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and have been dry food of the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   So if you are worried that after you believe in God,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   you will commit a great sin,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and you will be punished for this sin,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   it should have nothing to do with the content of this verse.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   This verse says that those who know God,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   deliberately refuse God,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   even humiliate God,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   that is, humiliate the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It is about these people.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   When a person deliberately refuses the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   he will never understand the truth.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Only the truth can liberate him.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Let's look at the second passage of the Bible,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   the Bible of the tree and the fruit.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Jesus Christ said,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   "You know that the tree is good, and the fruit is good;
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   the tree is bad, and the fruit is bad."
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   He is actually describing a person's inner self
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   as a water tank.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   What we are holding may be good, may be evil.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   More or less,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   these good and evil will be expressed through our mouths.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   So we have to look at our inner self.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   What is our inner self?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   What is the human nature?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   It is directly expressed through our mouth.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Some people say,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   "No, if I am very jealous of a person,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   but I deliberately praise the person with good words,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   is that okay?"
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   That's wrong.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Why?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Because the praise you say with your mouth is hypocrisy.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   When you express it,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   although it is a praise of a person,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   in the eyes of God,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   you are saying falsehood.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   It's all evil.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   So the good words you express with your mouth are all evil.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Because these are false, hypocritical words.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   In fact, this passage has a very important keyword,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   a word,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   which is the "spot of the poisonous snake."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Jesus Christ even said they were evil people.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Why?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   The devil went to test God.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Now these hypocrites are going to test Jesus Christ.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   The word "spot of the poisonous snake"
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   appeared in Matthew 3.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   The disciple Matthew
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   recorded it in this passage.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Jesus Christ said it.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   In Matthew 3,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   many people went to the river of Jordan
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   to confess their sins to John,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   and wanted to be baptized by John the Baptist.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   John the Baptist saw many Pharisees
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   and Sadducees coming to be baptized.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   He actually scolded them,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   "Spot of the poisonous snake,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   who told you to flee?
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   You will be angry in the future.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   You will be punished and repent.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Do not speak your mind.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   We have Abraham as our ancestor."
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   What is the Bible talking about?
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   It's a very special thing.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   At that time, the Pharisees and Sadducees
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   went there to confess their sins and wanted to be baptized.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   But Jesus Christ did not baptize them,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   even scolded them.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   "Spot of the poisonous snake" is a very serious term.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   "Spot of the poisonous snake"
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   means "spot of the devil's descendant".
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Why?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Because Jesus Christ told them
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   they did not repent.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   You have to get out of the fire.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   "The heart of repentance is within the fire."
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   That is, they did not confess their sins,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   which does not mean repentance.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Many people do today.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Even in the church,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   we say we confess our sins and we are baptized,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   but we do not repent.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   What is confession?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Confession is to tell people that I am guilty.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Even the Jews who betrayed Jesus
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   know that they are guilty.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   The Bible says clearly that they are guilty,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   but they did not repent,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   so they hanged themselves.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   True repentance has two meanings.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   The change of thoughts and thoughts
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   is the change from sin to righteousness.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   It is not enough.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   It needs to add the change of life,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   the change of behavior.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   That is, the change of thoughts and behaviors
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   from sin to righteousness is called repentance.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Knowing sin does not mean repentance.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   The change of thoughts and behaviors
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   from sin to righteousness is called repentance.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   If a person knows sin but does not repent,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   it is like the Jews who are now cursing the Pharisees.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   They have no life fruit.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Because they have never repented in their hearts.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   So today's words also refer to Jesus Christ
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   using the same words,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   "You are evil people."
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Because the devil went to test God,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   tested Jesus Christ.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   These people are also testing Jesus Christ.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   The same.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Finally, let's look at the passage of the Gospel of the Last Supper.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   This passage is very important.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I hope everyone will listen carefully
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   to my explanation below.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   This passage is very special.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   There were several words in it.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   The Pharisees said to Jesus,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   "Teacher, we want to ask you to show us the gospel."
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I emphasize that the content of the gospel I want to talk about today
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   is the gospel that can be seen with the eyes,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   not the gospel that changes a person's heart and mind
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and awakens the soul.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   These are all gospels,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   but this is the gospel that cannot be seen by the appearance.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   The gospel I am talking about today is the gospel that can be seen with the eyes.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   For example, the gospel that can be seen with the eyes
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   of those who cure diseases, drive away the devil, and turn the water into wine.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Jesus Christ then responded to their request
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   from chapter 39 to 42.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   He asked them to show us the gospel.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Let us see.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Can you show us the gospel?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   It is to be seen.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   When I explain chapter 39 to 42,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   I have to explain three aspects first,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   so that I can explain this passage.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   This passage is not difficult to understand.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   It mentions that the first night of the day is three days and three nights
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   in the fish's stomach, which is equivalent to the three days and three nights
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   between the resurrection of Jesus Christ and death.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It mentions the repentance of the Nile,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   and the queen of the south to hear Solomon's words.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   These are all things that we cannot understand.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   But there is a deep meaning behind it.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I want to explain it to you today.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Before I explain, I have to explain three things.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   The first is the word "sacrifice".
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   The word "sacrifice" is not the word "miracle"
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   in the original text and the Bible.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   It is not the word "sacrifice".
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   It is actually a sign.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   If you look at the English Bible, it says "they asked for a sign".
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   What is the sign?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   It is like a road sign.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   This road sign points to Satan.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   The sign is not the goal.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   The sign is only pointing to the goal.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   So if we see a sign in the kingdom of God,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   a road sign pointing to Satan,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   this road sign is not Satan.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   You are still in the kingdom of God.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Do you understand?
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   So let's not get the word wrong.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Because the Chinese Bible also means "sacrifice".
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   But the real English or original text
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   is an indication or a sign.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   So you understand this first.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   The second is "trust" and "repentance".
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   "Trust" and "repentance" are the same.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   It is one side of the coin.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   It cannot be separated.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   The word "trust" in the Bible is very clear.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   There is a range.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   The range of "trust" in the Bible
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   is the words of God and God.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   God is the true nature.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   The words spoken by the true nature are the truth.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   So we trust the words of God and God.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Today I believe in Jesus Christ and the teachings of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   This is the range.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   So "trust" is not about a student
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   who is hardworking in studying and has confidence in his exam.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   The confidence of a person is not.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   The confidence in the Bible is the words of God and God.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   The characteristic of "trust" is
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   we accept what we understand rationally.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   We trust God in the non-rational and super-rational range.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   For example, God teaches us to love and be kind.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   We can understand this rationally.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   If God says that Jesus Christ changed the water,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   this cannot be explained rationally.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   People's rationality cannot be understood.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   It is beyond the super-rational range.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   We accept it with confidence.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   And faith does not die.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   So we have confidence in God.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   This is the same as repentance.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   When we hear God's words,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   we change our thoughts and ideas and turn to the right way.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   When we turn to the right way,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   there are two aspects of repentance.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   The change of thoughts and ideas plus the change of life.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Turn to the right way.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   The change of life is that we have faith.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Because faith has action, it is death.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   So faith and repentance are two sides of a coin.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   We cannot separate them.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   So sometimes we talk about faith and sometimes repentance.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   They are the same thing.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   This is the second principle I want to clarify.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   The third principle is that we need to pay attention.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   I will explain it.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   In the Roman book of Paul,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   he explains how people can trust God.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   I call this the five principles of trust.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   What does he say?
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   "But if no man believes him, how can he pray to him?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   If no man hears him, how can he believe him?
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   If no man hears him, how can he preach him?
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   If no man hears him, how can he preach him?"
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   It seems difficult to understand the four principles.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   But if we read it from the end, it is very simple.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   First, if there is no man to preach, how can he preach?
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   That is, the man to preach first,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   the man to preach first, then someone to preach.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   If someone preaches, someone hears.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   If someone hears, someone believes.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   If someone believes, someone prays to God.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   So if we look at it in reverse,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   we see the five principles of trust in God.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   God's people preach God's way.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   God's people listen to God's words to preach God's words.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   If someone hears,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   if it is a good word,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   a word of respect for God,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   they will believe.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   They will believe and pray to God,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   and return to God's side.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   God's people preach God's way.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   People can hear in the third stage,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   and then have the opportunity to believe in God and pray to God.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   This is the five principles of trust in God.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   In the Bible, in Romans 7, it is mentioned that
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   "It is clear that the faith is from the one who hears,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   and the one who hears is directly from Christ."
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   This is a very important principle of the Bible.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   A person believes in God.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   Faith comes from listening to God.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   You have to rely on God,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   understand God's words,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   in order to have faith.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   There can be no other way.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   If we look at these five principles,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   we should pay attention to the relationship between the topic I am talking about today.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   The topic today is "The relationship between the work of God and the truth."
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   I want to talk about the relationship between the work of God and the truth.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   What is special about the five principles?
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   If you can see,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   there is no work of God that can be seen.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   The work of God is not in this process.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   The work of God that can be seen is not in this process.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   There is no work of God.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Some work of God is invisible.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   For example, a person hears,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   a person hears,
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   and it is the Holy Spirit.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   When the heart of a person is poured into,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   it is the Holy Spirit that awakens the soul of the person.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   This is invisible.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   It is also a work of God.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   But what I am talking about today is not the work of God that changes in the heart.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   What I want to say is the work of God that can be seen with the eyes.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Because these Fascists call Jesus Christ,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   "Show us the work of God,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   let us see the work of God that He wants to see with the eyes."
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Today you can see the five books of the Holy Spirit,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   the five books of the Holy Spirit,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   the work of God that does not need to be seen with the eyes.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   But this principle of the Bible,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Paul wrote it very clearly.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   But it was not Paul who came up with it.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   When we look at Jesus Christ,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   we understand that the revelation of God in the Bible is very exquisite.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   When Jesus mentioned the story of Jonah,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   we look at the story of Jonah,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   we see the five books,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   which were already in the Old Testament.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   We look at the third chapter of Jonah,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   we see that the second time Jonah was brought to Jerusalem,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   he went to the city of Nile,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   and told the people there,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   "You see, God has shown Jonah."
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Jonah followed the words of Jonah,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   and went to the city of Nile.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Then he entered the city and announced,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   "In forty days, the city of Nile will be reconquered."
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   God showed Jonah,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and Jonah listened to the message and preached it.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   The people heard it.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   What did they do?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   They came and believed in the Lord.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   They believed in the Lord and announced the ban on eating.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   From small to large, they had to wear a coat.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   It meant that they were in a dire situation.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   Not only that, they even had to bow down.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   Because they were worried that they would not be able to receive the baptism of Christ.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   They were worried that they would not be able to do it.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   They had to bow down and go to the cross.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   They pleaded with God,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   and then they had to turn away from their evil ways.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   That was repentance.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   So believing in the Lord and repentance are the same.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   They cannot be separated.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   So you can see that Jesus Christ told the story of Jonah.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Not only in his three days in the fishing boat,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   but also in the whole process,
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   the five steps of believing in God
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   did not require any visible signs.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   It did not require any signs.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   If these foreigners can't see the signs,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   but they still believe in them,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   then these Jews who saw so many signs of Jesus Christ,
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   and they still need to see a few more signs,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   but they still don't believe in them,
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   is it worth judging?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   Can these foreigners accuse you?
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   We, foreigners, can't see the visible signs,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   but we still believe.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Jonah said,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   "You have to repent in 40 days."
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   He did not allow you to repent,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   nor did he tell you to repent quickly.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   He did not say that.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Those people also believed and repented,
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   and left their evil ways to believe in God.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   So you can see that God showed people the way to spread the gospel,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   people heard the way,
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   and believed in the way,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and they pleaded with God.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   The five scriptures of faith,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   in the whole process,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   did not require any visible signs.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   This is one of the very important key points
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   that Jesus Christ used in this story.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   We can look at many examples
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   to prove that these five scriptures are correct.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   For example,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   John 4, Jesus Christ went to Samaria
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   to talk to a woman by the lake.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   She told him how many husbands this woman had.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Then they had a conversation.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Jesus Christ disdained the truth,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   he said God is the spirit,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   so worship Him with your heart and be sincere in worshiping Him.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   This woman said to him,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   "I know that Nehemiah is called the origin of Christ.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   He will tell us all things.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Jesus Christ said to her,
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   "I am the one who is speaking to you."
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   This is the first time Jesus Christ clearly told people
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   that He is the Savior.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   He told a woman from a foreign country.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   A woman from a foreign country,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   who was probably not visible to others.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   After this woman talked to Jesus,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   she immediately went to other people in the city.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Many people came out to hear Jesus talk.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Jesus stayed for a few days.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   Then Jesus said,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   "If you believe in Jesus,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   there will be more people who will believe in Him."
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   So you can see that Jesus Christ has been in Samaria for a few days.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   People believe in Him because of His way.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   There is no cure for the disease.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   Why?
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Because the Bible is very clear.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   "If you believe in Jesus, there will be more people who will believe in Him."
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   "If you believe in Jesus, there will be more people who will believe in Him."
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   This is what Jesus Christ said.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   So in the whole process of faith,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   in the people of Samaria,
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Jesus Christ did not see the miracle.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Let's look at why Jesus Christ did not need a miracle.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   I can see at least two reasons.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   The first reason is Hebrews.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Hebrews reminds us that we must pay attention to the way we hear
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   so that we do not stray.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   What is this way?
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   It is about salvation.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   It is about salvation.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   It is what Jesus Christ said.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   And the people who hear it are proved to be true.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   But at the same time,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   God uses the miracle of the Holy Spirit
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   and the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   to witness with them.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   The function of the miracle is to witness.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   The miracle is not the way of God.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   You have to hear the way to believe.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   The miracle is to witness.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   Like the sign points to the person who performs the miracle
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   comes from God.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   This is the function of the miracle.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   The sign points to the direction.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   This is the function.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   The second function is mentioned in Exodus 2.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   When the Savior came, the deaf could hear,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   and the blind could see.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   What does it mean to see?
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   It means God.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Jesus Christ did the miracle of healing the sick and driving away the evil.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   He took away the people who could not believe in God
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   because of the disease and the restrictions on flesh.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   He asked them to hear God's words,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   to see God, to know God.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   So there are two functions.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Jesus Christ did the miracle.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   First, he is the Savior of the language.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   The purpose of the miracle is to let people know God.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   So the most important thing is to hear God's way.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   But God also uses the miracle to witness.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Pointing to the direction of God.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   So in simple terms,
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   the miracle is like a witness
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   to point to God's existence and His great power.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Jesus Christ is the Savior of the language.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Jesus came from God.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Jesus Christ is the Holy Spirit.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   So the whole miracle is pointing to Jesus Christ, the Savior.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   So these miracles are not the purpose.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   The purpose is to point to the purpose.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Let us know that Jesus Christ is the Savior.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   He asked us to hear God's way.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   So the miracle is a means, not a purpose.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   The purpose is to hear and believe.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Because the faith comes from the way of hearing.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   And the way of hearing is directly from the words of Jesus Christ.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   Let's look at another positive example.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   When Nehemiah went to see Jesus,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   he said, "We"
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Pay attention to the word "We".
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   Who is "We"?
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   Nehemiah was a high-ranking Pharisee.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   He said "We" means
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   not all Pharisees thought Jesus was a king.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Not all Pharisees wanted to
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   accuse Jesus of his pain.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   There were a group of very intellectual Pharisees
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   who saw Jesus' miracles and knew that he came from God.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   Why?
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   He said, "We"
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Not only him, but also "We"
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   "know that you are a teacher from God.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Because the miracles you do
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   are not possible without God's presence."
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   So they saw the miracles.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Like a sign, it means you must come from God.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   This is the function of miracles.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   Miracles are not the purpose.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   This is the purpose of the miracles.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Jesus Christ came from God.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   When this happened,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   they heard Jesus' truth.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   So Jesus answered,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   "I tell you the truth.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   If man does not be reborn, he will not see God."
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   This is a very important truth.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   Then in chapter 16,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   "God loves the world, and even places his own son
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   at his door.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   If he believes in him, he will not perish,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   but will be reborn."
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   So you see, miracles are his function.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   He pointed to Christ,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   came from God.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   Then Jesus showed the truth.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   People believed it.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   This is one of the positive examples.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   There is also a counter-example.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   In John 2,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   Jesus performed many miracles.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   Many people saw the miracles and believed in his name.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   But Jesus did not deliver himself to them,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   because he knew what was in the hearts of the people.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   Jesus knew the hearts of people.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   He saw the hearts of people.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   What is the problem with these people?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   They saw and believed.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   If you look at these five verses,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   what is the problem?
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   "If you see the miracles, believe in him, and you will know him."
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   They did not hear it.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   Faith comes from hearing.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   The "hearing" is what Jesus said.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   So if some people see the miracles and believe,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   what do they believe in?
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   There is no basis.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Our faith is in the "hearing" of God,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   not in the miracles.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   So don't get it wrong.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   Don't be too excited about miracles.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   Don't be too obsessed with miracles.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   That is not what we want to see.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   Many people believe in God.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Whether it is the women of Samaria,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   or other villagers,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   they believe in Jesus' faith.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   Even the people of Mexico and Guatemala,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   they believe in God's faith.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   So those who believe in God's faith,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   but do not believe in God's faith,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   are meaningless.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   Jesus Christ does not teach them.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Because Jesus Christ knows that they do not have God's faith in their hearts.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Back to today's scripture,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   the Pharisees asked Jesus to show them the miracles.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   He had already seen so many miracles.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   One after another,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   from healing to healing.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   He saw the power of God in the material world,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   and also saw the power of God in the spiritual world.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   So Jesus Christ's power is getting stronger.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   They do not believe.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   They insult Jesus by calling him the "Devil King".
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   Even if Jesus Christ was healing the sick and chasing the devil on the Sabbath,
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   they use this excuse to kill Jesus.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   Why?
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   We see the answer in chapter 13.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   Because there is an answer in John 8.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   Jesus Christ said,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   "I know that you are descendants of Abel,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   and you want to kill me,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   because your hearts are not able to stand my wrath."
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   "You are descendants of Abel"
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   This sentence has just appeared.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   I have seen it before.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   "Descendants of Abel" emphasizes the pride of their spiritual life.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   We have seen it today.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   I remember I talked to a couple about faith.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   They said they were Christians.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   I asked them how to believe in God.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   They gave a very strange answer.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   They said, "We are Christians because
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   I was baptized by a very famous pastor in a church with more than 1,000 members."
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   "So we are Christians."
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   "It has nothing to do with religion."
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   This is the pride of the spiritual life.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   The Pharisees also have this pride.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   "But you want to kill me because your hearts are not able to stand my wrath."
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   After hearing this, they can't accept Jesus Christ's wrath.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Because for the Pharisees,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   for those who want to target Jesus,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   Jesus Christ's existence is affecting their authority,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   their status,
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   and even their interests.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   Why do I say this?
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   When Jesus Christ entered Jerusalem to be baptized,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   the whole structure of the church was like a company.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   There were a lot of businesses,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   such as buying and selling beef and exchanging money.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   A large business.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   Jesus Christ actually went there to cause trouble.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   He said they were doing business and destroyed the tables.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   Why did he do business?
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   When Jesus Christ was baptized,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   thousands of people followed him.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   Jesus Christ was not baptized in Jerusalem.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   He was baptized outside,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   at the lake.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Not at the religious center in Jerusalem.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   As a teacher of the Bible,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   people did not follow him, but followed Jesus.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   So it affected their status and authority.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   But not all of them.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   As I said,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   the Pharisees and some of the intellectuals
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   actually saw that Jesus Christ was a faithful man.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   But these people wanted to kill Jesus.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   It's outrageous.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   Even if you say you want to kill Jesus,
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   you don't have to kill him.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   They actually wanted to kill him with the intention of poisoning him.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   Because they could not tolerate the Holy Spirit.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   If we look at the next chapter,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   chapter 13,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   Matthew tells the story of Jesus' execution.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   After listening to the five verses,
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   before he was crucified,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   it was important to know which kind of soil he was on.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   Which kind of soil represents the heart of man,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   how he respects God's words.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   So in the Bible,
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   it mentions the roadside, the shallow soil, the steep, the good soil.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   Roadside refers to the words of the apostles,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   thrown on the roadside, and to be trampled a few more times.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Many people today are like this.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Not only to blame the Christians for spreading the gospel,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   but also to insult and mock Jesus Christ.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Some of them are shallow soils,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   which are pleasant to hear,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   but soon they will no longer be heard.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   Some soils are deep.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   They feel it's good to try to be a Christian,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   but they find that the world is better,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   and the good soil is more attractive.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   They no longer go to the roadside.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   The good soil is the small part.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   Jesus Christ said that there are few people who have enough.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   It is the words of those who have heard God's words,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   respect God's words,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   and change God's words to change their lives.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   Those are the good soils.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   So you see, these legal people are on the roadside.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   They are on the road of money and God.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   And the legal people who came to the bottom,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   in the end, are the good soil of the minority.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   They believe in God.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   So we go back to the previous passage,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   we see that Jesus knows their hearts.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   They want to see some more visible signs.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   In fact, they will not believe.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   Let's think about the Great Christian Egypt of Moses.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   They saw the Red Sea separated.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   They walked through the Red Sea in their own dry sea bed.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   They went to the opposite side of the Red Sea,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   there was nothing to eat.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   God gave them spicy food.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   They see the signs every day,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   but they do not believe in the signs.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   So the signs do not help people to believe in God.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   It is the way of God that can make people believe in God.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   Faith comes from hearing,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   from God's words, not from seeing the signs.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   So they saw the Red Sea separated.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   Every day they saw God throwing food to them in heaven.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   They do not believe in the signs.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   So we should not be vain in pursuing the signs.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   We should work hard to study God's words,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   to know God's words.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   This is the truth.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   So when Jesus answered them,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   he said, "The generation of evil and disorder,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   seek God's work."
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   Evil and disorder means not to believe.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   Why do I use this sentence?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   In the history of the whole of Israel,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   Solomon was a turning point.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   Solomon did a big evil thing,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   that is, he made many people
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   into the hands of foreign traitors,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   and at the same time,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   he brought the false idol of the foreign country to Israel.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   The king of Israel,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   whether it is the Kingdom of Israel in the north
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   or the Kingdom of Judah in the south,
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   committed the sin of worshiping idols.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   God wanted these two kingdoms to be destroyed.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   This is the grace of God.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   God wanted them to be destroyed,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   and they were painfully tortured.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   Since then, Israel has not worshipped idols.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   Since they did not worship idols,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   why did they say they did not believe?
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   It is because they did not believe in the heart of Israel.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   Because they did not put God in the center of their hearts.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   These people of Israel
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   only have the Chinese people
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   and the Pharisees.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   They only have the appearance of religion
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   and have no reality of religion.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   They are hypocrites.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   They do not believe in God.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   So Jesus saw their hearts and said,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   "You people of this generation are seeking a miracle."
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   He said, "There is only one miracle for you.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Except for the prophet Jonah,
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   how did Jonah survive three days and three nights
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   in the fish's stomach?
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   The same prophet had to stay in the ground for three days and three nights.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   This means that Jesus Christ died,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   was buried and resurrected.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   In the book of Luke,
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   there is one more sentence.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   He said, "How did Jonah make a miracle for you people?"
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   The miracle should also be indicated.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   People should be like this
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   to be a guidance for the people of this generation.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   What does this mean?
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   Jonah actually foretold Jesus Christ.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   When Jonah heard the call of God
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   to come to Jerusalem,
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   the place in northeast Israel at that time,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   he took a boat to the west.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   He wanted to take a boat to
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Spain, which was thousands of miles away.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   When he was on the boat,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   God let the wind and the waves.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Everyone at that time was afraid.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   Everyone prayed to their own God.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   Jonah told them, "You can throw me into the sea."
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   He sacrificed himself to calm God's anger.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   "Let others be saved."
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   This is what Jonah did at that time.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   This is to foretell Jesus Christ
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   to use his own life
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   to die on the cross for sinners
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   to atone for sins and to calm God's anger.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Jonah stayed in the boat for three days and three nights
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   to foretell Jesus Christ's resurrection.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   This is the great power of the witness God.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   That's what it means.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   Why did Jesus Christ say
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   "I will make you a miracle"?
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   Because we see Jesus continue to do miracles.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   But this sentence is actually meaningful.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   Jesus Christ's miracles
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   have nothing to do with these unbelievers.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   For example, he resurrected the dead from the cross.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   These are not related to these people.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   The only one related to these people
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   is Jesus Christ's resurrection.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   This is the ultimate miracle.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   Jesus Christ resurrected on the third day after his death.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   If they don't believe this, they can't be saved.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   So we look at Jesus' answer.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   In the trial, the Nile people
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   had to stand up and convict the people of this generation.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Because the Nile people heard the voice,
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   they heard the voice of Jonah.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   The word "repentance" and "belief" are the same.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   So Jesus' response
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   points to the five books of the Book of Ecclesiastes.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   These people had never seen the miracles of the eyes.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   They believed when they heard the voice.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   The Pharisees and many Jews at that time
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   saw a lot of miracles, but they didn't believe.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   So when these foreigners were judged,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   they could come out and accuse you.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   We foreigners have never seen miracles, but we believe.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   You see so many miracles,
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   and the Savior is in front of you,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   you don't believe.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   So you have nothing to say.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   So simply speaking,
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   the miracles and the truth
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   I am talking about the miracles of the eyes
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   have nothing to do with faith.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   The five books of the true faith
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   do not need the miracles of the eyes.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   The function of miracles is a direction.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   The direction of Jesus Christ is this salvation.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   So faith comes from hearing,
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   not from seeing God.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   The direction of hearing is the words of Christ.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   And we know the words of Christ,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   know the truth,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   the truth will make us free.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   The story of King Sibelius is the same.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   King Sibelius went to the south
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   to see King Solomon.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   He asked a lot of questions,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   Solomon answered all his questions.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   So Solomon did a whole-way job.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   After King Solomon heard the questions,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   he said, "If you have wisdom, you will be blessed."
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   Then he said, "Your God is worthy of praise."
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   He heard someone preaching,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   King Solomon listened and believed.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   Then King Solomon gave him a lot of gifts
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   and returned to his country.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   We generally believe that
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   when King Solomon returned to Ethiopia,
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   he brought the Jews back to Ethiopia.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   Because after 1000 years,
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   we know that
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   in the book of Exodus,
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   there is a priest named Ezechias.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   At that time, this priest served
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   under King Ezechias,
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   the head of the rich family of King Gama.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   He went to Jerusalem to worship.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   He was a foreigner who believed in the Jews.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   It was recorded that
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   he was reading the book of Ezekias in his car.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   He was holding a book of Ezechias.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   The book of Ezechias said that
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   the priest Ezechias was being killed,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   he was being judged unjustly,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   and he was being killed.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   Philip explained the gospel
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   and the gospel related to Jesus Christ.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   So we believe that
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   the Queen of Sheba believed in the God of Solomon
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   and brought the Jewish doctrine
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   to Ethiopia.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   It is worth noting that
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   this priest was holding a book of Ezechias.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   The Bible at that time was handwritten,
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   very expensive.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   He had a lot of capital.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   He bought a book to read.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   So I hope everyone will buy a good,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   well-known Bible
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   to study the word of God.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   Finally, we compare the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   He compared it with Jesus Christ with the book of Ezekias.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   The book of Ezekias was a prophet.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   Jesus was a greater prophet,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   a true body.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   But the book of Ezekias did not perform a miracle.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   It just said that you will be destroyed.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   He did not even mention them repenting.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   But all the foreigners in the city of Lemnipolis
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   repented and believed in God.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   Instead, Jesus Christ himself appeared
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   and preached the gospel to the Jews.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   He performed many miracles.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   But most Jews did not believe.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   Solomon and Jesus were kings.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   But Jesus was the eternal king,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   the son of God.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   The prophet of the king of Solomon and the king of Zebalia
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   did not see any miracles.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   Zebalia, as a foreigner,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   also believed in God.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   But many Jews
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   did not repent and believe in Jesus.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   So Jesus said that
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   this generation of unbelievers will seek God's miracles.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   So we should not be obsessed with the miracle of God's miracles.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   Because faith comes from hearing.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   Instead, we should work hard to study the Bible,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   understand the Bible, and spread the Bible.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   So that more people can hear and believe
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   and pray to God.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   Today, I will summarize the three points of the Bible.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   The first point is that
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   Jesus Christ knows our thoughts and ideas.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   So we should always be vigilant and reverent to God.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   Do not be ignorant and think that God does not know what we are doing.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   We can't hide.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   The light of God is always in us.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   The light of God is always in our hearts.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   We are just deliberately blind, deliberately deaf, deliberately dumb
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   to escape God.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   If we still want to keep some dark places in our hearts,
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   God knows.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   Do not deceive yourself.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   Jesus Christ is the Lord of the material world and the spiritual world.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   No matter what disease, ghosts, and evangelization,
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   He is the Lord of the material world and the spiritual world.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   And the Lord of God has come to us.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   the Lord of God is already in our hearts.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   But the question is,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   does our heart accept the words of Jesus Christ?
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   Do we listen to a part and not listen to a part?
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   Or is it a respectful and respectful teaching of God?
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   The second is to remove the fruit from the tree and the fruit from the seed.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   That is, our life must change and our heart must be reconciled with our repentance.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   Do not be a false Christian.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   Because being a false Christian is the most stupid.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   Rather than being a Christian who wants to be a false Christian in the church,
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   why not not go to church?
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   Because if you don't go to church, you will end up in hell.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   But if you live a false Christian life in the church,
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   you will end up in hell.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   This is the stupidest thing.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   So we should not deceive God.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   Because God is unbecoming.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   Believe in God and repent and confess your sins.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   Really ask God to help us to go through a holy trial and live a life that is in harmony with God.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   Do not be a slave to God.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   Finally, the work of God is a direction, not a goal.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   It is the direction of Jesus Christ's holiness,
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   so that people can hear God's words and see God's great power.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   So we should not be obsessed with the work of God.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   Also, do not think that the work of God is the foundation of faith.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   The work of God is not the foundation of faith.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   It is not the foundation of faith.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   Faith comes from the way of hearing,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   and the way of hearing comes from the words of Jesus Christ.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   So when Jesus Christ talked about his sign of the holy meal,
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   he said, "In the future, you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood."
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   Many people think that this is a difficult path.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   Maybe today I have talked for a long time,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   some people think that Professor Hsu's talk is very long and difficult to understand.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Jesus Christ asked the disciples,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   "Are you not leaving yet?"
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   The disciples followed Jesus Christ.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   Jesus Christ talked about a deeper path,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   and they all left.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   Jesus Christ asked them,
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   "Are you not leaving yet?"
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   Simon Peter answered,
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   "Lord, you have eternal life.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   Who are we to follow?
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   We have believed and know that you are the Holy One of God."
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   So Simon Peter stayed with Jesus.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   It is not because he thought, "Lord, you can do the work of God.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   Lord, you can feed thousands of people.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   Lord, you can do the work of God and help us to recover."
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   Simon Peter answered correctly,
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   "Lord, you have eternal life.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   Who are we to follow?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   It is not because he thought, "Lord, you can do the work of God.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   Who are we to follow?"
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   So we are very clear about the teachings of the Bible.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   "Lord, you have eternal life.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   Who are we to follow?"
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   I will share with you today.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   I hope you understand the relationship between the work of God and truth.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   The work of God helps people to point to the truth,
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   and it has the function of testimony.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   But the work of God is not the truth itself.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   Faith comes from the hearing,
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   and the hearing comes from the words of Jesus Christ.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   So I hope everyone will read the Bible carefully today,
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   and understand the words of God,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   especially the teachings of Jesus Christ.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   I hope the words of God will bless you.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   Thank you.
