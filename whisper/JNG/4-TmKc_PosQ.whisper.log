[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hello, everyone. I am Mr. Lui.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Welcome to my lecture today.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Today's topic is "Science and Creativity".
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I believe you all have the impression that
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   science and religion seem to have a lot of conflicts.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   I believe that many times it is because we don't understand both sides,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   and that's why we have these misunderstandings.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I will try to share my understanding with you today.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   The content of my lecture today is partly based on
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Professor Kuo-king's time-lapse,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and the books and videos of Professor Brian Cox of Manchester University.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I will also use the Bible to explain some of the topics related to creation today.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I would like to emphasize that the Bible is not a book of explanation,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   but its description of creation is in line with what we see now.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I will explain in detail later.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   In China, in the Western Zhou Dynasty,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   there was a saying that "the sky is round and the earth is flat".
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   At that time, people thought that the earth was square and flat,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   while the sky was round.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   So the sun and moon rotated in this way.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   This kind of understanding affects other Chinese cultures.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   For example, the copper coin in the middle is square and the outside is round.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   This is the concept of "the sky is round and the earth is flat".
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   The sky is round and the earth is flat.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The earth is flat and the earth is flat.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   The earth is flat and the earth is flat.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   This is the understanding of the universe of China 1000 years ago.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   In the 4th century BC,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Aristotle predicted that the earth should be round, not square.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   In China, about 100 years after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   the "Cyclical Theory of Heaven" proposed by Zhang Heng
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   believed that the sky was like a shell,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   and the earth was like a net,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   but the earth was flat and floating in the water.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So the shell is rotating outside.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   But in the Old Testament, 700 years before the founding of the Chinese Communist Party,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Aristotle had already said that the earth is round.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He said that the gods are sitting on the big circle of the earth.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The residents on the earth are like caterpillars.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   The gods are like a net, and the net is like a net.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   The sky is flat and the earth is flat.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   The net is like a net, and the earth is flat.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   The earth is like a net, and the net is like a net.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So in the Old Testament,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   it was already said that the earth is round.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   God pushed the universe out like a growing wormhole.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   The earth we live on now is the solar system,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and the solar system is a part of the entire galaxy.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   How big is the entire galaxy?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   There are 100,000 light years from one side to the other.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I want to explain that light years are not a unit of time.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Light years are units of distance.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   A light year is the speed of light traveling a distance of one year.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   How fast does the light travel?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Every second can revolve around the earth and turn 7.5 times.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   This is the speed of light.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So the universe is very big, so we have to use light years.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But light years are not big enough.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Sometimes we use light years.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Light years is the distance of light traveling 100 million years.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   The distance of the galaxy is one thousandth of a light year.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   The earth is one of the points.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You can't see it here.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But the arrangement of the universe
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   was described in the book of 1,500 BC
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   as "God created the earth, and the origin is in the void."
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   There is nothing to be said.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So the part of creation in the Bible
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   is not a book to explain physics,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   but its description is accurate.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   How big is the universe?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The universe is 930-940 light years.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   A light year is the distance.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I just said that the galaxy is only one thousandth of a light year.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So the universe is very big.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   How do we know that the universe is expanding?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   This is a phenomenon called "red light."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Everyone can feel it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Imagine a ambulance coming towards you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You hear a very oppressive sound.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   When the ambulance leaves you,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   the sound starts to relax.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   When the sound is getting farther and farther,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   the sound is getting longer.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So in science,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   the sound is moving towards the red side.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So we can see the light that is moving
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and the light that is not moving.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   The universe can affect many people's thoughts.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   For example, in the 500 BC,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Heraclitus, a philosopher,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   turned the universe into a sealed space that would not move.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Heraclitus at that time was the same.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   When the universe is not big or small,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   and it is forever like not moving,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   people will generate some reincarnation thoughts.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   All things are reincarnated and have a cycle effect.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But if the universe is expanding,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   it means that there is a possibility that it has a beginning.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   So it is not a unchanging universe.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   In Professor Fok-Kun's time-scale,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   there are many charts that help us understand the universe,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   time and space.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   One of them is a knife-shaped ice cream can.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   What does he want to say?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   He wants to say that if we imagine this board is a water,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   there is no water wave at the beginning.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   If there is a stone in the middle,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   the water waves will spread outwards.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   If the speed of this spreading outwards is the speed of light,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   the speed of light is the fastest speed in the universe as we know.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It can't be faster than the speed of light.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Then in one second, the speed of light will spread outwards.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Two seconds is even faster.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Three seconds is even faster.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   So this is the direction of time.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And this is the space that the speed of light can go.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   So if the speed of light is the fastest,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   the edge of the ice cream can is the limit.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Nothing can go faster than the edge of the ice cream can.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And all substances cannot spread as fast as light.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   So the substance can only exist in the space inside.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   This is what it means.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   When the universe is exploding,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   the force that spreads outward and the force that absorbs inward
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   must have a relative balance.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Because if the expansion is too strong,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   the space in the universe is too large,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   it is difficult for the substance to absorb together and form a star.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   We call this the open universe.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   The open universe is difficult to make life or stars exist.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But if the force of absorption is greater than the force of expansion,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   the universe will quickly stick together and shrink back to a point.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So it becomes a closed universe.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So scientists have calculated that
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   to make the universe continue,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   the data that spreads outward must have a small error.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   How small is this error?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   According to the calculation of Professor Paul Davis,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   a colleague of Professor Fok-Kam at Cambridge University,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   this error cannot be greater than 1/10^60.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   What does this mean?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It means 0.591011 is so small.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It is so small that it may not make much sense to us.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   In fact, what helps us understand is that
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   the universe I just mentioned is 940 billion light-years large.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   The difference between the universe from one side to the other
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   cannot be greater than the area of ​​a fingernail.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   This is the accuracy.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   If this accuracy is not reached,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   the universe will not continue.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So Paul Davis said that
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   many scientists believe that
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   the universe is fine-tuned for life.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   It can be fine-tuned to allow life to exist.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Although Paul Davis is not a Christian,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   many scientists have seen a lot of accurate data in the universe.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   When the accuracy is not good,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   they believe that the universe is fine-tuned.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Many books now use this "reverse speaker" to describe the expansion of the universe.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   What does this speaker mean?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   The lower part is the explosion point.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   When it starts to explode, it is like blowing a balloon.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   When it is blown, the balloon suddenly expands very quickly.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   In English, it is called "inflation".
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Then the speed of the explosion will slow down.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   When it slows down to a certain extent,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   we will find that the explosion is accelerating again.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So it is like a speaker.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   The flat surface represents the size of the universe.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Scientists did not know that the universe was expanding.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   The first time scientists proposed this calculation was in 1922.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   It was only in 1929 that it was proven.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   It's been about 100 years for our history.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So don't think that science is very advanced.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   In fact, we are still very primitive.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   As I said,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   the early 700s BC already knew that the universe was expanding.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   The God "shut out the heavens"
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   and the God "spread them out"
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   So to understand the explosion,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   we need to understand it with some more specific concepts.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   First, I will talk about the relationship between solid and liquid,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   the matter and the particles.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Suppose we have an ice cube.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   If we heat the ice cube,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   the ice will break into water.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   When we heat it again,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   the water particles will jump out and become air.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   When we heat it again,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   the water particles will break into acid.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   The particles will jump out of the atoms and atoms.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Generally speaking,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   we call anything that can flow as a fluid.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   For example, liquid, gas, particles can flow.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   These three are called fluids.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What if we heat the particles again?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   We break down the structure of the particles,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   such as electrons, neutrons, and neutrons.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It becomes acid, 10 atomic particles.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   What happens when we heat it again?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It becomes energy, not matter.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   But the explosion is the other way around.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   At first, all energy is at one point,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   the temperature is extremely high.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   When the explosion occurs,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   the space expands and expands.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   The temperature drops,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   and the particles start to form from energy.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Gradually, they become different kinds.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   When the temperature drops,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   we can have gas, liquid, solid, etc.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   So the big explosion starts from here.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   The simplest material in the universe is called gas.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   The sun is mainly gas.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Most of the universe is gas.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Gas is the simplest.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   The basic structure of a gas is that
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   there is a core in the middle.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   There are some positive and negative atoms in the core.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   The neutral atoms are neither positive nor negative.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   The negative atoms are in the electron.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   They are rotating in the outer orbit.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   The simplest structure of the universe is a negative atom.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   The core in the middle has only one positive pole.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   There is an electron in the orbit.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   The negative pole becomes a neutral negative atom.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   The negative atom does not glow.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   But when the electron absorbs energy in the orbit,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and jumps up to a higher orbit,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   and falls down,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   it will emit blue light from the fifth orbit to the second orbit.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   The fourth orbit to the second orbit will emit green light.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   The third orbit to the second orbit will emit red light.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   These three colors are called tri-color.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   These are the most basic colors.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   The sun emits tri-color.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   The LED emits these three colors.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   What is the importance of the tri-color?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   It is easy to remember.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   The logo of a TV is a tri-color.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   The tri-color can be combined into five colors.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   The sun emits these three colors,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   and emits white light.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   The amazing thing is that the eyes of the gods
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   receive these three colors.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   So we see the colors because
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   the eyes of the gods have these sensors
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   that reflect these three colors.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   There is a chart in the "Fork of Gold"
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   that shows the different stages of the universe after the explosion.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   The first stage is a very short time,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   called "Law of Physics Unknown".
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   We don't know what physics is.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I want you to pay attention to the upper part,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   which is about temperature.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   The temperature is getting lower and lower.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   The lower part is the time.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   The first part is the shortest part.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Physics is unknown.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   It starts from zero to 0.42.0+1 seconds.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   In such a short time,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   physics is unknown.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So all the explosion theories
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   don't count this part at the beginning.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   So they tell you directly that
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   there is no need for gods.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Because the explosion is not included in the model.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   They start from here.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   As the explosion progresses,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   the temperature on the top is getting lower and lower.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Because the space is getting bigger and bigger.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Time increases.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But the temperature is still 100 billion degrees in 1 second.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   If we feel 35 degrees is very hot,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   51 degrees is very hot.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Here it is 100 billion degrees in 1 second.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   After the explosion,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   it will be 10 billion degrees in 3 minutes.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   So when the temperature is getting lower,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   this graph shows that
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   from the atom to the atom,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   then some substances appear.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   The stars appear.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   The star system is formed in about 10 billion years.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Finally, the sun appears.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   I just explained that
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   the theory of quantum mechanics does not need gods.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Because it does not start from zero.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   The first part of physics cannot be explained.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   So who started it?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Science cannot explain.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Science cannot explain whether there are gods.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Now, in the theory of the explosion in 2022,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   I can explain with this graph.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I want to emphasize that it is 2022.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Why?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Because in the past two years,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   there have been many new discoveries.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   The model is not accurate.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I will explain later.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   But the basic explanation is
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   when the explosion started,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   it was very hot at first.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   After the explosion, the space increased,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   and some substances began to form.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   The light had appeared at that time.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   But the light could not come out.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Because at that time,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   the light and the electrons of other electrons
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   had interaction.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   At this time, it was like a very thick soup.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   The light could not come out.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It was like a very large fog.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   When the car lights were shot out,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   the fog covered the light.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   So at this time,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   although the light had appeared,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   there was light at first,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   but the light could not come out.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Around 380,000 years ago,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   the light suddenly appeared.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Why?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Because the temperature had dropped.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   The light particles and electrons
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   formed the simplest light atoms.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   So suddenly the light appeared.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Now we see the farthest light in the universe
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   is coming out at this time.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   After the light appeared,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   many light atoms began to form.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   The light atoms, like fog,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   covered the light.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   So we have a period of dark ages.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   According to the old model,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   after 300 million years,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   the stars appeared in 400 million years.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Because at this time,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   the stars began to accumulate together.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   The stars have a nuclear fusion process,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   producing some ultraviolet light.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Ultraviolet light can make
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   the electrons in the nuclear fusion atoms
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   jump and start to emit light.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Many stars have become a spiral structure.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It is called a star system.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It is estimated that it appeared after 100 million years.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   The earth appeared after the explosion of 90 billion years.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   The universe is now 137 years old.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   So the earth is about 47 years old.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   This is 2022.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I will use a simple chart to explain.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   At first, it is estimated that
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   there were stars in 400 million years.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   This is the period of dark ages.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Although the light exists, it cannot come out.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   There were stars in 100 million years.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I want everyone to remember these two numbers.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   There were stars in 400 million years and stars in 100 million years.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Two years ago, the Space Agency sent
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   a new James Webb space telescope to the moon.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It broke all our understanding of the beginning of the universe.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   On April 7, 2023,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   it was discovered that the earliest star system
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   was found in 300 million years.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   We thought that the star system existed in 100 million years.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Now, it has been found in 300 million to 500 million years.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   So it broke the model of our ancient science.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   In March of this year, it was found that
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   some stars have died in 700 million years.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   What does it mean by dead?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   It means that the whole star system cannot produce new stars.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   But remember that in 700 million years,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   the universe was still very early.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Now we are talking about 137 billion years.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   So 700 million years is still very early.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   But some stars have died.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   So they cannot produce new stars.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Earlier this year, a British scientist
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   discovered a very strange phenomenon.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   As I said, the universe is 940 billion light years large.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Our galaxy is only one thousandth of a billion light years.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   This British scientist noticed that
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   there are two huge structures in the universe.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   These structures are made up of large stars.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   One of them is called the Big Circle.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Its diameter is 130 billion light years.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Each point is a huge star.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   The other is a larger arc.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Its diameter is 130 billion light years.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   This creator is still making some strange structures.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It looks like a smiley face.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Very huge structure.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So it is very difficult for us scientists
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   to understand how these structures are formed.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   As I mentioned, everyone noticed that
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   the model of science is not absolutely true.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Science is just a tool of knowledge
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   for understanding the nature and physical world.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Science is not absolutely true.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Science must be constantly corrected.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Science is an approximation to the truth
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   in a physical world.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   It cannot be true outside the physical world.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   For example, science cannot be based on
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   a poem or a poem.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   A painting is not beautiful.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Parents' love for children is not science.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It is not a physical field.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Science has a very big limit.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It is not absolutely true.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So we must understand that
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   science has its own function.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Science is not an absolute authority.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The Bible is not a book of science.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   The Bible, especially the Book of Genesis,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   is a literary text.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   It does not explain the universe in a physical way.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   It is just a brief description of God's creation.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   The main theme of Genesis is to declare
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   that God created the universe.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   God created the universe with his sovereignty.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   At first, God created the universe in a state of vacuum
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and gradually became full of life and various miracles.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   So the first three days are the basic preparation
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   for the fourth and fifth days.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   The first day is the day of the sun.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   The second day is the day of the vacuum.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   The vacuum is water and sky.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   The third day is the day of the plants.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   The fourth day is the day of the stars.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   The fourth day is the day of the sun.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   The fifth day is the day of the vacuum.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   The fifth day is the day of the plants.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   The fifth day is the day of the birds.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   The sixth day is the day of the animals.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   This is the structure of the Bible.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   The most important thing is to declare that the universe is God's creation.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Although it seems to be very light,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   the most important theme in the first four sentences
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   is God's creation.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Although it is a few sentences in Hebrew,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   the theory of the big explosion we just talked about
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   is not accurate now.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   But we can understand the basic concept.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   But the time, maybe we scientists
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   have to re-change the model
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   because of the new discovery in the past two years.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Although they have to change the model again,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   but we can notice that the basic words
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and the framework of the universe
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   we have observed are consistent.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   If we look back at the beginning of God's creation,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   we can see that Professor Fok-Kam's picture
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   shows a moment of vacuum.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Although God created light,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   the light cannot come out.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   There is a dark period.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   After the dark period, the light comes out of the dark.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   So the Bible mentions that light is good,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   and the light and dark are separated.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Light and dark are later to be separated.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Of course, we can't say that these sentences
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   are the creation of the whole universe.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Because it is a literary description,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   not a theoretical description.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   But I want to say that
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   the Bible says that God created the universe.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   This is the point.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   But in the Bible,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   the creation of the universe is mainly about the earth
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   from the second day to the sixth day.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   The first day is about the universe,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and the second to the sixth day is about the earth.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It is more detailed.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And in the Bible,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   there is a detailed description of
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   the understanding of the earth
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   by modern scientists.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   They believe that the earth was a very hot fluid at first.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   A very hot fluid.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   I just mentioned the fluid,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   including the solid, liquid and gas.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It was very hot at first.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   At first, they thought that
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   the earth we were born on had no atmosphere.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Even if there was, there was no oxygen.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Because what did the gas look like?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   It was like the gas that came out of the volcano.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   It was a poisonous gas,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   like sulfur.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   It was not a transparent gas.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   So they estimated that
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   the earliest living creatures on this earth
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   came from the ocean
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   and absorbed sulfur.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   The earliest living creatures
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   absorbed these toxins
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   and produced oxygen.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Oxygen is transparent.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   When it absorbs toxins from the atmosphere
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   and produces oxygen,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   the atmosphere becomes transparent.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   When there is oxygen, other creatures can slowly form.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   For example, fish, reptiles, abalone, and finally humans.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   This is the current understanding of modern scientists.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   If we pay attention to the Bible,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   it is very strange.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   The four sentences I said on the first day
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   are about the formation of the universe.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   From the second day to the sixth day,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   it is about humans.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Here it talks about the water of the pig.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   There are different types of fluids.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   The water is divided into up and down.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Some fluids are heavier, some are lighter.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Some fluids are heavier, some are lighter.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   The use of sulfur is heavy,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   the use of water is light,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   the use of steam is light.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   The fluid is divided into up and down.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   If you have ever been on a plane,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   you will notice that
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   when you fly to a few thousand feet,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   the outside temperature may be -60 °C or -70 °C.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   When you fly to a higher level,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   the temperature is low,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   the steam will turn into water and fall to the ground.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   The ground will form a geological shell.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   The geological shell of our planet is very thin.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   It is about 15 to 20 km on average.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   So our planet is like an orange.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   There is a hard skin.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   There are many fluids and fluids in the middle.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   There is a lot of hot sulfur.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   A lot of melted iron is spinning here.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   So the sequence here is that
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   there is water at the beginning,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   the water falls to the ground,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   the ground is cooled and formed a geological shell.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Then the water is collected in the geological shell
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and becomes the sea.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   When there is a sea, there is no rain.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   According to the Bible,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   first there is a green plant,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   a plant of iron seeds,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   a green creature.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Why green creature?
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Because of the effect of the sun.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   First, it absorbs the smoke from the atmosphere.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Then it excretes oxygen.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   So with these carbon dioxide,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   the green plant that absorbs the sun's effect and produces oxygen,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   like the seaweeds,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   we have a large atmosphere.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Then, the third one,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   we see two rivers,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   the first is the Yangtze River,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   where we see the sun and the moon.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Then, the creatures appear,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   which is water,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   and come out of the water.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   It is the same as what scientists believe now.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Then there is a bird.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Then there is a big fish.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   In Chinese, it is also called big fish.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   In English, it is a monstrous creature.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   It is very huge,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   maybe similar to
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   dinosaurs.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Then, at the end,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   there are insects,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   beasts,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and other creatures.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Finally,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   according to the image of God,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   we have to follow our own image,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   and finally become human.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   The last one is
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Moses.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   At least 1500 years ago,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   that is,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   3,500 years ago,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   God moved him to write the Bible.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   He did not have
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   modern scientific knowledge.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   He did not even know
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   the disease,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   the bacteria.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   But God let him write
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   this order,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   which is the same as
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   what we scientists understand now.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   This is the miracle of the Bible.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   I want to explain one more sentence.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   God said,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   we have to follow our image,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   and finally become human.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Why is this sentence important?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Because I believe that
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   there are misunderstandings
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   in the scientific world.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Some people say
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   that if you count the history of
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   the Israelites to the time of Adam,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   it may be around 7,000 years.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   If I find a human
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   with a human skeleton
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   of 20,000 years,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   how do you explain it?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   The DNA is very close.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   The Bible says that
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   the definition of human
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   is not from the DNA,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   but from the image of God.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   God may have done something
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   similar to humans
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   10,000 years ago.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   DNA is a very close creature.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But those creatures at that time
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   did not have God's image,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   no God's spirit,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   and could not communicate with God.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   So God did not
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   have a human skeleton.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   So the human in the Bible
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   is not defined by DNA,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   but by the image of God.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Here, we are the three-dimensional
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   God, the image of God.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   This is the definition
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   of the human in the Bible.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   So if we find a human skeleton
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   with a human DNA,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   it is also a human,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   not a human.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   So we can say that
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   the human is a human.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   The human is a human.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Not a human.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   As I said,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   the most amazing thing in the Bible
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   is that Moses did not study
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   at a modern university.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   He did not have the knowledge
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   of modern science.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   But he wrote the book
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   "The Book of Genesis"
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   more than 3,000 years ago.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Although it is not a materialistic book,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   it has a lot of precise
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   definition of the universe.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   As I said,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   in the 1500 BC,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   God created the earth
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   in the sky
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   with the power of man.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   The sky is the structure.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   In God's eyes,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   a thousand years are as one day,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   a day is as a thousand years.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   This is the relative theory
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   we know now.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   These concepts have existed
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   since ancient times.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   As I mentioned,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   God knew that the earth
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   was a structure created
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   by the expansion of the universe.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   God used his power to create the earth.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   This is a wise world.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I will explain the wisdom
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   later.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   So we notice that
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   the universe expansion
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   we can observe now,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   the order in which the earth
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and the organisms are formed,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   the order in which the organisms
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   are formed,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   the description in the Bible
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   is the same.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   These scientific interpretations
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   are described in the Bible.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   As I mentioned,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   wisdom,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   we know that DNA
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   is not just a material,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   DNA is a program of life.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   There is a programmer,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   there must be a person
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   behind the programmer.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Because the creator is the source of wisdom.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   So we can't say
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   there is only material.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   There is no other.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Because we can see
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   there is a creator behind this material.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   There is a creator behind this material.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Human knowledge of science
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   is very short and very active.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   We only know that a battery
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   will produce a battery wall
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   in 1820.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   God has already predicted
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   that in the early days of creation.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   As I mentioned,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   the rocks in the middle of the earth
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   are still flowing.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   There are a lot of iron
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   in the middle of the earth
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   flowing like lava.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   This lava
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   is like an electricity
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   and produces a battery wall.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   This battery wall is very important
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   because when the sun storm
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   hits us,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   it is a shield, a protective shield.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   So our earth still has a large atmosphere.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And the atmosphere of Mars
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   is already very thin.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Because the atmosphere
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   of the earth
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   has already blown away
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   the atmosphere of Mars.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Because we have this
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   protective shield,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   we can survive.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   We see the polar lights,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   the polar lights,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   when the solar panels
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   hit us,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   they dissipate
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   the energy in the air.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   So we see the light.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   But this is a protective shield.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Without the protective shield,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   all living things cannot survive.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So when the sun storm
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   hits us,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   it is very kind to us
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   to arrange this
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   battery wall for us.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   This chart represents
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   the earth surrounded by the sun.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   We have four seasons here.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Last week
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   was summer.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   If you think about
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   the summer,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   we are facing the sun
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   at noon.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Do you know
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   how many times
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   the earth rotates itself?
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Many people answer
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   one circle.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   One circle is 360 degrees.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But if we really
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   rotate 360 degrees,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   there will be a problem.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Why?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   If we rotate
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   one circle a day,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   the sun will be here
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   in the future.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   After half a year,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   when noon comes,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   we will be here
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   on the day of winter solstice.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   We will not face the sun.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   The sun will be at night.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   It turns out that
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   God is very wonderful.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   God makes the arrangement
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   of the earth surrounded by the sun.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   He rotates 0.9856 degrees
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   with us every day.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   One circle is 360 degrees.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   It turns out that
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   the earth rotates
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   360.9856 degrees.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Why?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   We have 365 days
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   or 365 days
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   in a year.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   In addition to the second,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   we have half a year
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   to winter solstice.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Every day,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   we have more than
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   one day of winter solstice.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   If we add 0.9856 degrees,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   it will be 180 degrees.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Originally,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   when we were here
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and went to winter solstice,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   God made us
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   more than one degree.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   When we are in winter solstice,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   noon is also
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   under the sun.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Isn't it wonderful?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   So you notice
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   that when the creator of the world
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   is extremely wonderful,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   he even arranged
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   the earth to rotate a little more
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   for us.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   We see that science
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   cannot prove
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   that God exists.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Science is only applied in the natural world
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   and the material world.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   God is a spirit.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   So science is not an absolute truth.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Science is only limited to
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   the approximation to the truth
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   in the physical world.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Science is not a authority.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   God made people
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   in the absolute world
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   through a revelation.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   God made people
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   in the non-absolute world
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   through a revelation.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   After people were made,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   they produced
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   many different knowledge.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Science is only one of the knowledge
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   that can be applied
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   in the material world.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   It cannot explain
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   art,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   love of parents to children,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   art, poetry, songs, and dance.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Science cannot do that.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Science is limited.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   If we look at the future prediction,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   people in the superstition
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   will look at the whole.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   But if we look at how science is applied,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   economic prediction,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   weather prediction, and science prediction
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   are not accurate.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   So we always blame
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   the astronomical observatory for bad predictions.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   We will say they are not doing enough.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   But in fact, they have limitations.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Although they have all the super computers,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   but because science is limited,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   science is only slowly
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   approaching the truth.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It is not the truth itself.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   If you look at the Bible,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   you will notice that
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   the Bible is very different.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   The words of God in the Bible
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   whether you like it or not,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   it must happen.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   So the words of God in the Bible
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   I will explain later.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Why does God
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   have to be disdainful?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   The Bible has already said,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   "My will is not your will,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   your way is not my way,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   how high is the sky above the earth,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   how high is my way above your way,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   how high is my will above your will."
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   This is what God
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   announced to us.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   God is much higher than us.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   God is much higher than us.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   God is much higher than us.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   God is much higher than us.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   I use these two photos
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   to explain what is disdainful.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   This photo
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   is taken with my dog
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   when we were playing.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   My dog is a smart dog.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I really went to class with him
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   and got his certificate.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   But no matter how good he is,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   I do research, I watch TV,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   or I listen to music,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I will not explain to my dog.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Because his
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   cognitive ability is limited.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Every time
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I teach him
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   some knowledge from a higher level of wisdom
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   to a lower level of wisdom,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   I call it a "discourse".
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   I can teach him to do things
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   he can't do normally.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   For example, I can teach him
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   not to pick up food from the table
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   and eat it when it falls to the ground.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Just like in the Olympic Games,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   the chess competition,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   the chess players
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   can train the horse to dance.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   The horse doesn't know how to dance.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   From a higher level of wisdom
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   to a lower level of wisdom
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   to teach and pass on some knowledge
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   is called "discourse".
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   The same reason,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   God gives people
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   the highest level of creativity,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   gives us the smartest rationality.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   I use this yellow circle
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   to represent people's rationality.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   If God's wisdom is infinite,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   then we can't
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   be as smart as God.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   God's wisdom is far
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   higher than our mind.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   God's wisdom is far higher than our mind.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   God's wisdom is far higher than our mind.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   If God's wisdom is infinite,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   then it is impossible
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   to try to describe
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   an infinite God
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   with human's wisdom
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   and rationality.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   So,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   when Thomas Jefferson
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   said a very important
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   principle,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   God creates human's rationality,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   human's rationality
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   cannot create God,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   human's rationality
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   can only create God and images.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I want to say it again.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   God creates human's rationality,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   this small rationality,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   human's rationality
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   cannot create an infinite God,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   human's rationality
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   can only create God and images.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   I will give you
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   a few examples to explain
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   what Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   The most famous
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   "Fortnite Theorem"
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   is the "Theorem of Music".
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Music is a 18th century
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Scottish philosopher.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Many modern
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   philosophers and philosophers
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   use similar
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   theories to try
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   to prove that God is
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   bad.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   What did he say?
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   If God is good,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   he will not allow
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   evil and sin in the world.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   If God is all-powerful,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   he has the ability to
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   stop evil and sin.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   But in fact,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   the world is full of evil and sin.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   So, he used
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   the "Fortnite Theorem"
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   in the very small circle
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   to deduce that if God is good,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   he is not all-powerful
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   because he has no ability
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   to stop evil and sin.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   So, they used the
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   limited wisdom of people
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   to deduce a God.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Their God said
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   God cannot be all-powerful
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and good at the same time.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   This is what Thomas Jefferson
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   said very clearly.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   People use their limited wisdom
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   to try to describe an infinite God.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   God can only produce a false god.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   This false god cannot be all-powerful
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   and not all-powerful.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   God cannot be all-powerful
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   and not all-powerful at the same time.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   This is the most exquisite observation
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Not only this,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   there are also
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   such stories in the Old Testament.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   When Moses went to Mount Sinai
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   to receive the Ten Commandments,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   the Israelites
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   were making gold bulls
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   at the bottom.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   This gold bull was not an idol.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   This gold bull was a gift
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   from the Israelites.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   They wanted a God
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   who could produce
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   and understand
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   God.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   A God
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   who can produce,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   control
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   and understand
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   God
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   cannot be a true God.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   It can only be a false God.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   This is the explanation
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   of Thomas Jefferson's observation.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   There are so many human rationalities.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   They are all made up rationalities.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   To try to explain the infinite wisdom of God,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   we can only make a false God.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   So you can see
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   that whether you don't believe
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   God's wisdom,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   believe God,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   but believe God in your own way,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   the Israelites
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   also produced a false God.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Their conclusion is also a false God.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Now many people
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   are also making a false God.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   They are trying to
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   infer God's wisdom
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   from the rationalities of the people.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   You may have heard of this question.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   If God is omnipotent,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   can he make a big stone
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   that he can't lift?
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Whether it is a big stone
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   that cannot be lifted,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   or a car,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   what he wants to say is
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   if God is omnipotent,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   can he not be omniscient?
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   If we turn this into
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   a sentence,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   if A is God,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   B is omnipotent,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   he asks
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   if A is equal to B,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   can A not be equal to B?
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   This is a theory
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   based on human limitations.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Where is this question?
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   If A is equal to B,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   can A not equal to B?
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   This is a question of the question itself.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Because this question itself is not logical.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   A question that is not logical
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   is not a logical answer.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   So when people think they are very smart,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   and try to infer an infinite God
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   with human rationality,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   they can only come up with
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   such a mistake.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   We often get stuck here.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   In fact, if people think clearly,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   all the miracles of Jesus Christ
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   cannot be understood
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   by human rationality.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   So we actually need
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   God's inspiration
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   to understand
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   God's inspiration.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   God's inspiration,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   I call this part "exceeding our rationality".
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   It is God's inspiration.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   So God's words,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   God's deeds,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   are what we need to accept.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Even if we accept
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   God's inspiration,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   we only know
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   infinite God a little more.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   We will never fully understand
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   this God.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Because if we really understand this God,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   we will only be
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   a false God in this larger area.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   So people in this area
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   often be a false God.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   People who are willing to
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   accept God's inspiration
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and exceed their rationality
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   to accept and believe in God
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   are only a little more intelligent.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   We will never fully understand God.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   So we need to know
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   where our limitations are.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   How to pursue truth?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   There are ways to be faithful to others,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   ways to be faithful to God.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   In the past,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   there were Heraclitus of Helium,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Buddha, Confucius, and Lao Tzu.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   These are all great people.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   They pursued truth all their lives,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   and tried to find the truth
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   through many years of life experience.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   But why did they find the truth?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Because they were not the truth.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   This is also pointed out
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   by Thomas Lembke.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   These people
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   have pursued the truth all their lives
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   because they were not the truth.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   We can see in the Bible
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   that Jesus Christ
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   was baptized
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   at the age of 30
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   according to the Old Testament.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   He was baptized at the age of 30.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   At first,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   he claimed that
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   he was the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   He claimed that
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   he was the only way, the justice
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   between him and the Father and the eternal life.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   He was the truth itself.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   He was the source of life.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   Life was like the Lord of our lives.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   In John 1,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   the first chapter,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   "The beginning of the world is the way,"
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   this "way" is about Jesus Christ.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Because Satan,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   after Jesus Christ ascended to heaven,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   about 5 to 60 years later,
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   he subdued his knowledge
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   of Jesus Christ
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   and wrote down
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   John's Gospel.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   At that time,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   his other disciples
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   had all died.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Only John's Gospel
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   and the Book of Mormon
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   were left.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   It is mentioned here
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   that the first creation
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   had this "way" and this "truth."
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   This "truth" is Jesus Christ.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   This "way" and this "truth"
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   are in the same place with God.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   This "way" is God.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   What does it mean?
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   We usually think that the truth
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   is the philosophical thought
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   found by some intellectuals.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   It is wrong.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Here it tells us
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   that God is the true essence of truth.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   God is the truth of life.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   God is the absolute truth.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   And the absolute truth
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   is the truth
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   because God is the true essence of truth.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   The opinions he expresses
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   and the words he speaks
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   are the truth.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   He has the light,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   and it becomes reality.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   This is God's ability.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   He is the truth.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   What he says will happen.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   So, everything is done by God.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   God also announces
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   that the whole universe
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   is done by God.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Here, especially Jesus Christ,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   the Holy Trinity,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   everything is done by God.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Everything is done by God.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   His life is in Him.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   He is the source of life.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Life is the light of man.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   But the light shines in darkness,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   and man does not shine in light.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   If we look at this chart,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   God is in the absolute world,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   in the eternal world,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   free and eternal,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   justice, holiness,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   love and the true essence.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   When he led Jesus Christ
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   to create the universe,
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   the world of creation,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Jesus Christ claimed
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   that he was the Alpha,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   the Creator,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   so the whole human history
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   is in the hands of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   From the eternal world of God
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   to the world of his own creation,
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Jesus Christ
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   is the one who created
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   the universe.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   He is the only way to return to eternity.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   So in the Bible,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   we should not be surprised
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   by some very clear proclamation.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   For example,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   in the book of Timothy,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   there is only one God
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   in the middle of God and man,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   there is only one God,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   and that is Jesus Christ,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   who was born for man.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   There is no salvation other than him,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   because in the world of man
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   there is only one God,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   and that is Jesus Christ.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   So we can see that
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   science is just a part
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   of the pre-made wisdom,
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and the pre-made science
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   cannot prove the wonder of God.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   So you can see that
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   even if we go back to the theory of the big explosion,
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   all scientists cannot go back
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   to the point of the explosion,
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   because for a while,
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   physics cannot be applied.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   So all his theories
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   of the big explosion
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   started after the explosion.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   So science cannot prove
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   the existence of God.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   But God himself
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   gives us general and special
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   instructions
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   to let us know that he exists.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   The general instructions are
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   his creation and to give people
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   a conscience,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   to create for us to have different knowledge,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   a conscience,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   so that we can develop religion and science,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   but most importantly,
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   God gives special instructions,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   special instructions,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   God gives the Bible,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   God's words,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   and Jesus Christ's coming to tell us
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   what God is like.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   So God's existence
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   is not proven by science,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   so there is no need for
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   any scientific evidence.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Science cannot prove
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   the existence of God or not.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   God's existence is
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   God's own manifestation.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   The Bible says so.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   The Bible says that God's righteousness
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   is manifested in the voice,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   God's anger is manifested in heaven,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   God's things are manifested by God himself.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   It is not that people look for God,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   people cannot find God,
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   but God finds people.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   But people usually need to see
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   the results of God,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   understand rationally,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   then believe,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   like a goldfish,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   and then believe in God.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   But the Bible has a very strange principle,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   that is, by faith,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   not by eye,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   I will explain later.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Let's look at the results.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   The Bible says that
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   Jews need to see the results,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   and the Hebrews need to seek wisdom,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   that is, to understand rationally.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   People are like this now,
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   so people need to see with their eyes,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   understand rationally.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   So some people always say,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   "Why don't you call your Jesus
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   to come down and see me?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   I believe when I see him."
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   So people are often trapped
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   in the eyes of the eye,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   and understand rationally.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   The Bible says that
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   the way out is by faith,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   not by these two things.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Can God make people believe?
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   When we look at the book of Acts,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   God separated the Red Sea
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   from the West,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   and the Israelites passed through
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   the desert on the other side
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   of the Red Sea.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   They saw the Red Sea
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   separated and they did not believe.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   They had no water,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   no food,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   and Moses had killed them.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   They had nothing to eat.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   God gave them some food
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   called "Mala" in heaven every day.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   They ate it every day,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   and saw Mala and miracles every day.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   They did not believe.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   They went to the West Mountain,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   and they built a false god
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   called "Bai-Kim-Nau"
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   in their hearts.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   Finally, they went to the land of Canaan,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   the land of the angels.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   They sent 12 scouts
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   to this new place.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   None of them believed.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   The result was very, very miserable.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   The miserable result was
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   that the Israelites
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   had been in the desert for 40 years.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   This generation of disbelievers
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   could not enter the land of Canaan
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   and the land of the angels.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   This is the miserable result.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   Can the miracle make us believe?
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   In fact, everything God does
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   is a miracle.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Your and my life
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   is a miracle.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Your and my heartbeats
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   do not depend on
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   your and my efforts.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   You can ask God to jump faster
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   or slower,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   but you cannot ask God to jump or not jump.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   It is the grace of God
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   that keeps our lives going.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Your and my existence
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   is not our choice.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   But today,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   when we live and see
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   the miracles every day,
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   people do not believe.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   So it is useless to see the miracles.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Is reason important?
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   We need to understand that reason is important.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   But we need to understand that reason
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   also has its functions and limitations.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   The reason God gives people
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   is beyond other creatures.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   So reason is important.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   But we need to pay attention to
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   that reason is not rational.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Many people do not believe in God,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   but believe in the devil.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Many people believe in eternal life
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   and eternal life.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   But they tell you that
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   death is like a light.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   What evidence do you have to prove that?
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   No evidence.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   It is not rational.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Many people believe in themselves
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   when they are not sick or cold.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   But when they have symptoms,
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   they hope to have a miracle.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   Right?
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   So atheism is also irrational.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   God's existence does not matter
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   whether I believe in him or not.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   It does not matter if I say he exists or not.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   Reason has limitations.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   I just explained that
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   people's reason is limited.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   A limited reason
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   cannot understand
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   this infinite God.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   We need to rely on enlightenment.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   So our common mistake is
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   people's limited reason and
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   selective wisdom
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   limit God's enlightenment.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   This human reason
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   becomes a difficulty
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   to understand God.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   I just gave three examples.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   The theory of music.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Can God be human?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   This is a theory that
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   the stone cannot lift.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   This is a theory that
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   is limited.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   is limited.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   is limited.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   is limited.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   is limited.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   is limited.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   is limited.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   is limited.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   God's enlightenment
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   is limited.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Some people say whether to believe or not
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   does not matter.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Look at the Bible.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   God's existence or not
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   does not matter to people's subjective opinion.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   God does not exist
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   because I believe in him.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   God does not exist because I do not believe in him.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   So whether you and I
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   believe God exists or not
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   does not matter to people's subjective opinion.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   We are trapped
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   in the theory of a person.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   We just pretend to be a God.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   We just pretend to be a God.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   There is also a choice problem in the theory of God.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   I once gave a lecture
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   to a brother.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   He told me
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   that he believed
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   in many of Jesus'
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   miracles.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   The only thing he did not believe in was the resurrection of Jesus.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   I looked at this picture.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   All of Jesus'
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   miracles
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   are accepted
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   in the theory of supernatural.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   If people have a choice
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   whether to believe or not,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   I cannot see the whole
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   enlightenment of God.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   Even in the Bible,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   some people ask me to
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   give a blessing, I will listen.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   Some people ask me to change
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   my sinful behavior,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   I do not want to listen.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   People have a choice.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   Wisdom is not unimportant.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   God gives us
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   the highest rationality.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   So we
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   have to use up
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   God's wisdom.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   After using to the limit,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   we have to open our minds
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   with confidence
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   in this supernatural
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   realm to accept God's
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   inspiration.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   God's infinite wisdom
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   limits our understanding of God.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   God may want to
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   show us the whole
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   light.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   If we wear colored glasses,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   we can only see a part of it.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   This is our rationality that limits us.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   So we have to open ourselves
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   to see everything.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Do not rationalize it like a partition
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   between God and us.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   I just talked about faith.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   The faith we talked about
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   is the ability of people
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   to believe and not to believe.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   The faith we talked about
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   is not a student telling his mother
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   that he is very hard-working in studying
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   and has confidence in his exam.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   Our faith has three
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   points.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   Our faith
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   is limited to our faith in God
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   and
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   God's words,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   which is God's inspiration.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   This is limited to this part.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   Our faith is in rationality.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   We have to understand
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   that we have to believe in
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   the part that is beyond rationality.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   After we understand
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   God's words,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   we have to
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   obey
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   and turn God's words
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   into the power of life change
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   to change our lives.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   Because faith is infinite.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   So the faith and repentance
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   are two sides of a coin.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   Sometimes God calls us to repent
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   and we see heaven.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   God says faith is eternal.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   Faith and repentance
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   are two sides of a coin.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   It is the same meaning
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   that eternal life and seeing heaven.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   The third point of faith
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   is that our faith
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   is based on God's faith.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   I believe in God's words.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   I have to understand
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   and obey God's words.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   The most important thing is that I believe
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   not by my ability,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   not by how much I can believe
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   and how much you can believe.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   It doesn't matter if we believe or not.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   God is also faithful.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   So we put our faith
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   in God's faith
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   because God's faith is unchanging.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   So the Bible tells us
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   that when God
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   gives His word,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   He is holding it
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   to give His word.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Because you and I are not reliable.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   Only God is reliable.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   In the whole gospel,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   only God is faithful.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   He can speak
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   and do things.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   He is unchanging.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   His faith is unchanging.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   So our faith
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   is based on God's faith,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   not our ability to believe.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   We don't believe at all.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   We feel it will change.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   But God's faith is unchanging.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   I just said that
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   the general revelation is related to the universe.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   I won't talk about it here.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   The special revelation is that
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   God is holding the Bible
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   and Jesus Christ
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   to be born.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   This is a belief based on evidence.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   There are different people
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   in the religious community
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   who have done different statistics
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   on the meaning of the Bible
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   and have already accepted a part of it.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   One of the things
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   that I have calculated
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   is that there are
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   about 2,500 languages in the Bible.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   Some count
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   more than 1,800 languages.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   I use this calculation
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   to say that there are
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   about 2,500 languages,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   and more than 2,000 of them
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   have already been born.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   So our faith
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   is not based on estimates.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   We are based on God's words
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   and God's faith.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   Because God
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   tells us that
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   whether we agree or disagree
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   in education,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   whatever God says will happen.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   So in the book of Genesis,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   God says, "I have told you
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   from the beginning of the world,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   from ancient times to the end of the world,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   that my plan
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   must be established,
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   that I must achieve
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   what I have set out to do.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   God will do what He says."
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   This is the foundation of our faith,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   the faith of God.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   God does not rely on people
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   to find Him.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   God Himself
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   shows Himself.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   How does He show Himself?
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   He chose Israel
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   as His teaching tool.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   He chose a nation,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   told it's words to this nation,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   and then led this nation
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   to be glorified by the whole world.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   His goal is to show
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   people,
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   to let people know that He is the only God,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   and no other gods.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   He emphasizes that
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   He chose Israel
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   because it is His sovereignty.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   So you don't need to ask
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   why He chose Israel.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   God says, "Because it is My sovereignty,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   it is My choice."
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   God chose people
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   for the purpose of
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   telling us
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   about the creation of God,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   blessing and help
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   in front of us.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   If we listen to God,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   we will be blessed
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   by the revelation of
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   the good and righteous justice of God.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   If we don't listen to God,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   we will be deceived.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   There are three important messages
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   in the Bible.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   First, I talked about God's creation,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   then the fall of man,
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   the punishment,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   and the salvation.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   I will not go into too much detail
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   about the Bible,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   about sin and salvation.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   Today I mainly want to talk about
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   how the Bible proves
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   that God's existence is not based on science,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   but the Bible itself,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   God's own judgment.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   I mentioned the source of sin,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   so I won't spend too much time on it.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   The most important thing I want to say is
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   that God solves the problem of human sin.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   You and I are both sinners.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   But it doesn't matter if you are comfortable or not.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   God told us that we are sinners.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   Because you and I know how to lie since childhood,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   we don't need anyone to teach us.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   We even lie to the point
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   that we have no concept of sin.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   We don't feel ashamed.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   The sin of man is not just the sin of action.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   Jesus Christ explains that
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   when you hate someone,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   you commit a murder.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   You are guilty of the first crime,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   which is to kill someone.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   You are guilty of the second crime,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   which is to kill someone.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   The first crime starts from the heart.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   I hate someone,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   maybe I don't dare to kill him
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   because I don't want to go to jail
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   or I can't beat him.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   I hate someone for a lifetime,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   I hate someone for a lifetime.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   I have a guilty conscience against others,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   I have committed a crime.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   Jesus Christ said that
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   the heart is the starting point,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   the heart of God.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   So each of us is a sinner
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   but God is just and loving.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   God said that
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   no sin will be judged,
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   but God did not kill anyone.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   So God arranged
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   a redemption for us.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   He said that
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   even if you kill someone,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   you have committed a sin,
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   and you have to be punished by God.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   But God gave us a grace
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   that we can be clean
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   by following Jesus' old ways.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   How to do it?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   We can't be atonement for ourselves.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   God sent his only son,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   Jesus Christ,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   a man without sin,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   a man who has the same flesh
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   as you and me,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   who has been tested and has not committed a crime,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   to become a redemption,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   a sacrifice,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   a salvation,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   a high-quality
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   without sin,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   a high-quality without inferiority.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   He used this atonement
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   to atone for others.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   He ate the blood of Jesus,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   shed the blood,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   and covered the sins of others.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   As long as people believe
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   in the God Jesus Christ
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   as their Savior,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   they can be called righteous.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   This is the reason why
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   the Bible says "to be clean by faith".
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   The reason is that
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   you and I are not good people,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   we are bad people, we are sinners.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   But when we go to the cross,
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   Jesus died for us.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   We admit Jesus,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   we admit that we are sinners,
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   we admit that Jesus is our Savior,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   and we accept his salvation.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   This means that we add our sins
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   to Jesus Christ,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   and die on the cross for us.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   At the same time,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   Jesus is the only one
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   who is a man of the Holy Spirit.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   He added his sins
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   to us like a garment,
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   and covered us
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   with his blood.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   He covered our shame
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   and made us
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   sinners as innocent people.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   This is the reason why
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   we should be clean by faith.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   So the most important thing
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   is that the Bible says
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   that this Savior,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   who created you and me,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   not only created you and me,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   but also made you
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   and me into human beings.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   So God loves the world,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   and even bestowed
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   his only begotten Son to us.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   Let us believe in him,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   not to die, but to be eternal.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   This is God's love for us.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   The salvation of God
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   is completely the same
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   from the beginning of the world
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   to the end of the world.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   When Noah committed a crime,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   God had already said
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   that the offspring of a woman
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   in the future
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   is Jesus Christ.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   Because Jesus Christ is a holy man,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   he has no male father.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   The offspring of a woman
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   in the future
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   is his foster father,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   not his biological father.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   He is a holy man,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   so the woman is Jesus Christ.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   When God wanted to
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   drive Adam and Eve
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   away from Eden,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   God killed an animal
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   for Adam and Eve,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   a bloodthirsty swine,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   to make a leather
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   for Adam and Eve.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   This leather is to cover
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   Adam and Eve's shame
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   from the crime,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   to foretell the future.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   In the Bible,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   "The man will repent of his sin,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   and our sin will be added to
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   Jesus Christ, not our own sin."
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Jesus Christ is like a wedding gown
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   to cover our shame.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   This is the meaning.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   There are more than 300 languages
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   in the Bible
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   that are related to Jesus.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   For example,
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   in the 600s and 700s
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   before the communion,
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   it was said that he was
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   born of a woman,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   born in Bethlehem.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   In the book of Isaiah 53,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   there are many detailed descriptions
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   of Jesus Christ.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   He will be despised,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   he will suffer a lot,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   he will be oppressed
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   and we will be safe.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   Because of his oppression,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   we will be saved.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   He was a criminal,
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   he was oppressed,
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   he was buried,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   he became a prisoner,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   and so on.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   In the Bible,
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   in the book of Matthew,
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   this Savior came
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   and asked us to repent.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   He has two reasons.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   He wants to
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   collect the
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   useless fire
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   and burn it.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   It means that
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   he came to save us
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   and then to judge us.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Jesus Christ came twice.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   The first time was the cross
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   to save humanity.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   The second time was the judgment.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   He gave us a chance to repent.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   So when people want to
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   have a miracle,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   to see,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   to have a wisdom,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   to understand God's solution
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   to human sin,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   there is no mercy.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   There is only a cross.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   This cross represents God's salvation,
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   God's love for humanity,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   forgiveness and grace.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   It represents the death of the world
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   and the resurrection of the world.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   The resurrection is the
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   certainty of eternal life.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   So Jesus Christ is resurrected.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   This represents love.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   The Bible also mentions
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   that it is rare for people
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   to die for others.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   Some people die for others,
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   some for others.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   But Jesus Christ died for us
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   when we were sinners.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   God's love
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   is manifested to us again.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   Today we are sinning against God.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   God loves us.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   He speaks to us in tongues
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   and asks us to repent.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   This is God's love.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   So the cross represents
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   God's salvation,
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   God's wisdom,
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   God's mercy,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   Jesus Christ himself
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   suffered all the evil of human sin
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   and suffered alone
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   to save us.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   What is faith?
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   I just explained
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   the object of faith,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   the characteristics and the basis of faith.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   In the Bible,
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   there are two more things to mention.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   First, the grasp of the judgment,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   the proof of the truth
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   of the truth of the cross.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   If we look at this chart,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   we are here
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   in the year of our life.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   We are here now.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   People's eyes
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   can only see
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   what is in front of their eyes.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   We don't know what will happen
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   tomorrow.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   But the eyes of faith
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   can transcend time and space.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Because our faith
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   is based on God's words
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   and God's truth.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   What is the unseen thing?
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   What is the unseen thing?
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   From the beginning of the world,
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   the Bible tells us
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   how God created
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   and how he led
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   the Israelites
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   to spread the word of God
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   to the whole world.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   All the prophecies
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   that have already happened
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   have not been seen by us.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   But we believe
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   they are God's words.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   There are still many
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   unfulfilled prophecies
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   that are
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   something we are looking forward to.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   For example, Jesus will come back to judge.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   We know that
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   he will come back
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   based on God's truth.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   So this faith
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   is beyond time and space.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   I want to emphasize
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   that this faith is not
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   what you and I believe.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   Our faith is based on God's words.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   God's words and God's words.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   The foundation is God's truth.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   What God says
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   has nothing to do with our belief.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   What he says will definitely happen.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   So what has already happened,
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   although I am not there,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   I believe.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   So based on the eyes of faith,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   it is beyond time and space.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   Because of this reason,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   Hebert Rice said
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   a very important thing.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   We understand that
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   the universe is created by God's words.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   This is the point.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   The point of the Big Bang.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   It really has a Big Bang.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   Scientists can't explain it
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   because of physics.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   But because of faith,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   we know that God created it.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   This is what
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   can be seen by the eye
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   is created from what can't be seen.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   The universe that can be seen
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   is created from the God
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   that can't be seen.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   The matter that can be seen
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   is created from the energy
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   that can't be seen.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   Because of faith,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   we see very broadly.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   Beyond time and space,
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   we have to understand a lot.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   I don't need to be there.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   I know because God told me.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   And what God said will definitely happen.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   We have to believe.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   So our faith is much bigger
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   than people's rationality.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   All God's work
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   is in the part of super rationality.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   All God's work is in this part.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   If we just keep ourselves in this part,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   we will never see God's greatness.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   Abraham
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   we call him the father of faith.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   The God and his
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   herds
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   can't be seen in the whole life.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   The God told him
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   "The herds of the people
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   are blessed because of you."
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   This "herds" refers to Jesus Christ,
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   the Savior.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   He appeared in the
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   2,000 years of the cross.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   He can't be seen in the flesh.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   What did Jesus say?
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   He said in the Gospel of John,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   "Abraham rejoiced
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   and looked up at the days
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   when he saw joy."
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   How did he see?
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   His faith is the spiritual vision.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   We believe God's words.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   So when God speaks, I believe.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   So Abraham
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   looked up
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   and saw the Savior.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   Although he couldn't see him
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   in the flesh,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   he saw him with faith.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   His national land
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   was built.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   When the nation
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   was in the Jerusalem,
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   he was no longer in the world.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   He had faith.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   He believed God.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   This is the reason why he had faith.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   The Bible says
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   faith is beyond time.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   The faith we talk about
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   is not what you and I think.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   It is God's word.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   It is God's word and the faith based on God.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   One thing is very important.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   It is the resurrection of Christ.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   We have never seen it.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   Neither have you and I.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   The resurrection of Christ.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   The Bible says
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   the resurrection of Christ.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   Who was Paul?
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   Paul was the leader
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   who led people
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   to persecute the Christians.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   Until the resurrection of Christ,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   Paul was the only one
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   who was resurrected.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Paul was the only one
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   who was resurrected.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   Paul said in the Bible
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   I have been faithful and have given you
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   the most important thing.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   The most important thing is
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   that Christ is as recorded in the Bible.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   It is not what people say.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   It is as recorded in the Bible.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   It was said in the Bible.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   He died for our sins.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   He was buried.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   It is as recorded in the Bible.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   He was resurrected in three days.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   We read it in the Old and New Testament.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   Jesus Christ predicted three times
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   that he would be killed and resurrected in three days.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Then he emphasized
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   that the resurrected Christ
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   would be Jesus Christ.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   The 12 disciples
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   would appear.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   The 12 disciples
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   would appear.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   The 500 brothers would appear.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   The son of Jesus would appear.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   The disciples would appear.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   The son of Jesus
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   would appear.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   He was the least of the few.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   He was the one who was disowned.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   Many people
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   went to the temple to see
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   the 12 disciples.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   Except John,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   who wrote the book of Ephesians
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   and John's letter to John.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   All the other disciples
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   were Christians.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   One of the disciples
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   was called Thomas.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   Thomas was also
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   a Christian.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   Christianity has a very important meaning.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   It is the Kingdom of Israel.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   It was in 586 BC
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   which is equivalent to
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   the Spring and Autumn Period in China.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   It is described in detail.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   It is described in detail.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   The Israelites were thrown
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   from heaven to earth.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   They were driven to various countries
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   and humiliated.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   They were separated in 2600
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   and in 1900.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   They were separated in 2600 and in 1900.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   It is mentioned in the Old Testament
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   that those who were exiled would return to their homeland.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   There was no country in the world
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   that was able to
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   return to their homeland
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   after 2600 years.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]   There was no country in the world
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   that could return to their homeland
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   after 2600 years.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   So, before 1948,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   many people could still
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   laugh at the Bible.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   After 1948,
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   we could not
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   laugh at the Bible.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   Jesus Christ
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   resurrected.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   Many believers
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   witnessed
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   One of them was Thomas.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   Jesus Christ resurrected
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   for the first time in the Gospels.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   Thomas was not present at that time.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   When the other Gospels told him,
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   he said, "Unless I personally
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   touch the nails of Jesus,
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   I will be saved."
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   When Jesus Christ was resurrected for the second time,
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   he asked Thomas to touch his wounds.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   Thomas knelt down
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   and told Jesus,
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   "My Lord, my God."
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   Why?
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   Because Thomas no longer used his limited
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   human wisdom to block
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   God's revelation.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   He understood that Jesus Christ was God.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   Jesus Christ then told him,
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   "You see me and believe,
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   but those who do not see and believe
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   have the good news."
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   "What kind of people are these?"
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   Jesus Christ said,
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   "Jesus Christ told us
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   that we were not there
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   when Jesus Christ was resurrected.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   Jesus Christ told
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   those who did not see
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   and believed
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   that Thomas was there.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   You believe me,
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   and you have the good news."
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   That's all for today.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   Thank you.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   Take care.
