1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
咁我哋今日呢就嚟到舊約僕人傳第七

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
集中去思考薩姆爾同以利嗰個可以話係一個師徒嘅關係

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
如果上次呢我分享嘅時候呢

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
都有講過話教小朋友呢有啲嘅原則

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
其中有一個呢可能你聽完呢有少少唔同意

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
就係我話呢有啲嘢唔可以畀佢揀嘅

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
唔可以畀佢揀嘅

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
譬如話食藥你都好多人都覺得係喎

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
食藥你冇理由畀佢揀食藥呀定係飲汽水

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
因為可能佢嘅思考未有咁嘅能力去到分析藥嘅好處

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
同埋可樂嘅壞處

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
咁但係今日呢好想同大家講呢就話當你個小朋友大咗啦

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
喺座同埋上面呢都有好多小朋友好多人呢你都教導過小朋友

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
就係話去到大嘅時候你開始要畀佢選擇

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
唔知你有冇試過你個仔或者女點都要揀嗰樣嘢

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
但係你明知道嗰樣嘢對佢係唔好嘅

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
但你都冇乎要畀佢揀有冇試過呀

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
有囉好多人埋頭啦

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
譬如話揀大學即係當你個仔女讀大學嘅時候呢

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
佢唔知仲有冇問你意見呢

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
但可能當你問你意見嘅時候你又分析曬啲嘢畀佢

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
唔好咁揀啦唔好咁揀啦唔好咁揀啦

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
點知個人我係要

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
我係要揀完之後點知讀完都唔夠一半

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
就話都唔啱我嘅

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
我讀埋今年唔讀啦咁

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
嚟到加拿大呢無論係溫哥華喺多倫多呢

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
我都識到好多呢啲後生仔

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
讀極呢都唔想畢業咁樣

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
因為佢覺得冇所謂你覺得好有所謂

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
因為你哋係集體負責制

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
佢曬咗一年嘅青春你又可能曬咗一年嘅金錢

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
今日好想分享呢上帝都曾經面對差唔多嘅景況

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
就係佢嗰班仔女即係佢嘅子民擺明要揀一啲嘢

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
係上帝已經話完畀佢聽你咁樣揀唔好嘅

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
點知佢哋話我係要

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
但係上帝嗰一刻都冇負

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
我哋今日去思考上帝嘅呢個情況

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
但係分享之前想睇一睇返以嚟嗰兩個衰仔

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
上次講咗少少佢點衰法

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
今次講埋另一半佢仲衰嘅地方

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
咁上次提到呢就係以嚟嗰兩個仔呢一個叫阿伐利

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
一個就叫菲尼哈

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
咁第一個罪狀呢上次提到就係佢唔認識上帝

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
以嚟嘅兩個兒子係惡人唔認識耶和華

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
惡人

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
聖經講得好清楚就話佢係一個惡棍

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
係一個無禮

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
英文話low regard for the Lord

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
即係話同上帝冇關係

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
竟然間自己身為祭司

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
聖經話同上帝冇關係

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
呢個係第一個罪狀

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
第二個罪狀係藐視耶和華嘅祭物

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
如果大家記得呢之前我哋都講過憲制

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
其實有好多好嚴格嘅規定

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
但係呢兩個衰仔所謂祭司

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
竟然間自己定咗啲另外一套嘅規矩

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
喺撒末爾記上二章十三到十五節

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
咁樣講

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
佢呢兩個祭司代百姓係有咁樣嘅規矩

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
凡有人憲制正主欲嘅時候

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
因為要獻畀上帝

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
正主欲嘅時候

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
祭司同埋僕人就黎

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
做咩呢

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
手拿三叉三尺嘅叉子

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
下一章你就見到點樣係三尺嘅叉子

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
然之後呢就將叉子往罐裏往頂裏

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
往斧裏往窩裏去插

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
插上嚟嘅肉呢

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
祭司都取咗佢

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
凡上到士羅嘅以色列人

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
佢哋都係咁樣看待

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
即係人哋遠道而嚟

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
佢為咗獻祭畀上帝

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
竟然間祭司行過可能係肚餓

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
跟住一行過見到你喺度憲制

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
跟住佢搵個叉一叉

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
攞咗嘢食就食

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
甚至又喺未消之油以前呢

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
祭司嘅僕人就嚟對憲制嘅人話

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
將肉畀祭司

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
叫佢敲罷

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
佢不要煮過的

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
要生的

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
仲要係未煮過

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
即係本來應該先畀上帝嘅

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
佢仲要搵僕人嚟咁樣去攞

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
所以佢係一個惡棍

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
係一個無賴

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
第十六章佢話憲制嘅人

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
如果話必須先消之油

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
然後你可以隨意取肉

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
僕人就要話你即刻畀我

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
唔係我就搶

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
呢個完全係一個無賴嘅所為

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
佢唔畀竟然間要自己走去搶

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
佢既係祭司

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
佢哋都係上帝同百姓嘅中間人

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
但佢哋就用佢自己嘅權力

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
去滿足自己嘅貪婪

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
所以聖經

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
喺二章十七節薩姆爾基咁樣講

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
佢話如此

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
呢兩個少年人嘅罪

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
喺耶和華面前

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
甚重了

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
因為佢哋藐視咗

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
耶和華嘅祭物

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
呢個係第二嘅罪狀

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
佢藐視耶和華嘅祭物

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
第三嘅罪狀

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
上次都有提過

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
就係同婦人糾合

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
以嚟年紀甚老邁

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
聽見佢兩個兒子

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
待以色列眾人嘅事

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
又聽見佢哋喺會幕門前

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
同事後嘅婦人糾合

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
上次講到呢個罪係非常之大

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
頭先嗰個嘅罪係得罪上帝

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
呢個罪係得罪埋所有嘅人

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
但係去到咁惡劣嘅情況

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
呢個爸爸竟然間都只不過係

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
去到廿四節話

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
阿仔呀唔好咁樣

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
我聽見你哋嘅風聲不好

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
你哋洗耶和華嘅百姓犯咗罪

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
都只不過係咁樣輕輕大過

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
但係上帝佢用咗九節嘅聖經去罵佢哋

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
其中有一節係咁樣講嘅

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
佢係我所吩咐喺我

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
在我居所嘅祭物

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
你哋點解要踐踏

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
尊重你嘅兒子過於尊重我

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
將我聞以色列所獻美好嘅祭物肥己

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
我特別睇到就係呢句說話

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
你嘅兒子尊重你嘅兒子多過尊重我

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
呢一刻大家千祈唔好表態

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
如果你問你會唔會尊重你嘅兒子

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
多過尊重上帝

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
你唔好動呀個頭

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
因為我認識太多嘅父母

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
我相信全世界都係

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
佢哋好坦白話

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
我個仔係我嘅老細

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
如果你咁樣講過呢句說話

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
可能呢句說話有份話你

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
你尊重你嘅仔女多過尊重上帝

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
究竟我哋係咪咁樣呢

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
去到第三十節

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
因此耶和華以色列嘅神說

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
我曾說你和你父家必永遠行在我面前

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
現在我卻說決不容你們這樣行

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
因為尊重我嘅我必尊重他

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
藐視我嘅

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
他必被藐視

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
去到第三十四節

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
你嘅兩個仔

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
佢哋二人必一日同死

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
我要為自己立一個忠心嘅祭司

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
他必照我嘅心意而行

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
呢度主要係交代

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
佢哋兩個仔嘅下場

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
同埋上帝話

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
我要撇棄要放棄以利

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
同埋佢嗰兩個仔

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
我相信以利真係一個完全冇行動嘅爸爸

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
當見到咁樣嘅事

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
當上帝講得咁清楚

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
用九節嘅聖經咁樣話佢嘅時候

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
佢一丁點補救措施都冇諗過做

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
當我再繼續睇到《撒姆爾記》第三章嘅時候

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
睇到一節經文

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
我睇嘅時候真係打咗一下冷鎮

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
我即刻而家我睇返呢

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
我而家即刻都冇管動

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
你可以上嚟檢查下

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
呢句經文係咁樣講嘅

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
《撒姆爾記》上三章一節

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
佢話當哪些日子

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
耶和華嘅言語稀少

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
不常有默示

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
當哪些日子

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
耶和華嘅言語稀少

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
不常有默示

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
即係話上帝冇嘢同嗰啲人講

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
冇嘢同佢啲子民講

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
可能有兩個原因係會有咁嘅情況

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
第一,上帝冇嘢同佢哋講

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
呢個第一個可能性

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
第二個可能性就係上帝覺得

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
喺人同埋佢嘅中間

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
冇一個中間人可以傳話

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
因為呢兩個祭司非常之不濟

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
我打冷戰嘅原因係原來

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
一群本來係上帝嘅子民

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
係上帝嘅仔女

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
原來嗰個殿

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
竟然間會落到如斯嘅境地

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
冇嘢好同佢哋講

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
今日呢個都成為

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
我相信喺地上面

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
每一間教會嘅反省

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
不常有默示

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
默示嘅英文可以譯做vision

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
vision可以叫做異象

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
即係話

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
究竟上帝想點樣帶領一間教會

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
前面佢有冇俾到傳道人

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
有冇俾掌執

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
有冇俾弟兄姊妹睇到

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
有個個方向我哋係可以去行嘅

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
呢個係異象

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
我哋真係要向上帝祈求

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
求佢對我哋講說話

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
求佢唔好唔理我哋

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
我相信對於我哋教會

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
係最更加要求呢樣嘢

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
係最多人有機會問到我哋教會

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
究竟你有咩異象

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
究竟你有咩使命

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
因為我哋係使命浸信會

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
究竟如果有人喺出面話

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
你返緊邊間教會呀咁

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
然後我返緊使命浸信會

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
跟住佢話使命浸信會

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
有咩使命呀你哋

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
我哋會點樣答呢

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
我哋會點樣答呢

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
當然我哋今年我哋可以將

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
我哋嘅主題話畀你聽

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
我哋要靈命更新

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
我哋要愛主更深

236
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
呢個係我哋呢一年嘅使命

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
當日上撒慕爾收到嘅使命十分清晰

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
因為耶和話要揀選佢做為傳話人

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
喺第十九節撒慕爾長大啦

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
大家都記得撒慕爾細細個

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
斷奶嘅時候已經去到聖殿

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
佢跟從以嚟

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
耶和話就同佢同在

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
使佢所說嘅每一句話都不落空

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
從但到別斯巴

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
所有嘅以色列人都知道

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
耶和話立撒慕爾為先知

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
如果你睇地圖

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
但係邊呀見唔見到呀

250
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
但係最上面係白

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
而去到最邊嘅南就係別斯巴

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
因為整個國家嘅人都知道

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
撒慕爾係佢哋嘅祭司

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
去到廿一節

255
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
耶和話又再試落顯現

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
因為耶和話將自己嘅話

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
默示俾撒慕爾知道

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
撒慕爾就將呢個話傳遍以色列地

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
搵到適合嘅中間人

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
然之後上帝開始有番說話

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
同佢嘅子民去傾計

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
上次提到撒慕爾肯定係一個

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
動有影響力有領導力嘅領袖

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
以色列人真係起嚟回應

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
並且歸向返耶和話

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
大家記得上次立咗一個石頭講到

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
就係叫以辯以謝呢個石頭做記號

268
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
喺撒慕爾記上第七章十三十四節咁樣講

269
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
從此菲律士人就被制服

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
不敢再入以色列人嘅境內

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
撒慕爾作祭司嘅時候

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
耶和話嘅手攻擊菲律士人

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
菲律士人所取以色列嘅成衣

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
從以甲侖直到加特都歸以色列人了

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
即係話原本所失嘅土地

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
已經收服失地

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
屬者城嘅四境以色列人

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
也從菲律士人手下收回

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
嗰時以色列人與阿摩利人和好

280
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
跟住講撒慕爾嘅影響力去到邊度呢

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
喺第十五節撒慕爾平生作以色列嘅祭司

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
佢每年都巡行到伯特利、吉格、米斯巴

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
在呢幾處審判以色列人

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
可以睇到佢嘅領導力

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
佢嘅能力佢嘅影響力

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
係比佢師傅更大

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
佢喺唔同嘅地方

288
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
從佢嘅一篇頭先我哋所讀嘅經文

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
係佢嘅退休嘅演講

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
睇到佢嘅一生

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
可以話係為住以色列人

292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
撲心撲命

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
第二節嗰度講

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
而家有呢個王喺你哋面前面

295
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
我已經連老發白

296
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
我嘅仔都喺你哋嗰度

297
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
我從幼年直到今日都喺你門前面行

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
我喺這裡

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
你哋要喺耶和華同佢嘅壽高者面前

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
給我作見證

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
我奪過誰嘅牛

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
搶過誰嘅爐

303
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
欺負過誰

304
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
虐待過誰

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
從誰嘅手裏受賄賂

306
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
因而眼合呢

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
若有我必償還

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
因為之前以你兩個仔太差

309
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
薩姆爾講嘅呢段說話

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
跟住眾人點樣回應呢

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
眾人話你未曾欺負我哋

312
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
虐待我哋

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
也未曾從誰手裏受過什麼

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
嘩好青年呀呢個祭司

315
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
呢個士司

316
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
薩姆爾再問

317
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
薩姆爾同佢哋講話

318
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
你哋喺我手裏冇爪著什麼

319
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
有耶和華同佢嘅壽高者

320
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
今日為證

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
跟住眾人一齊回應話

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
願上帝為證

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
但可惜

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
上梁雖然正

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
但原來下梁都一樣會歪

326
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
究竟佢兩個仔又點呢

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
你兩個仔係衰仔

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
佢兩個仔

329
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
聖經咁形容

330
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
八章三節

331
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
佢兒子不行他的道

332
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
貪圖財利

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
修受賄賂

334
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
屈枉正直

335
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
唉

336
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
點解會咁呢

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
因為咁好嘅爸爸

338
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
點解

339
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
又有兩個衰仔出嚟

340
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
呢個失敗嘅爸爸

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
冇喺佢嘅師父嗰度學到教訓

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
佢個仔一樣係濫權

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
一樣係藐視上帝嘅律法同埋百姓

344
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
跟住繼續講

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
喺撒姆爾記八章一字二節

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
撒姆爾年紀老邁

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
就立佢嘅兒子作以色列嘅士司

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
長子嘅名叫約尼

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
次子嘅名叫阿比亞

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
佢哋喺別斯巴作士司

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
你有冇留意呀

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
佢老啦

353
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
佢又要搵繼任人啦

354
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
佢搵咗邊個呢

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
搵咗佢兩個仔

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
搵排咗喺別斯巴呢個地方

357
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
做士司

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
我唔知道呢個係咪

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
自古以嚟

360
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
或者話世界性都係咁

361
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
就係無論個繼承者係幾咁唔掂都好

362
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
都要交個位置畀佢

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
縱使係對於市民對於人民係唔好嘅

364
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
但係佢仍然要交個棒

365
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
畀一個咁不濟嘅人

366
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
但係大家有冇留意到呢

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
就係我哋頭先睇到經文提到呢

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
薩姆爾嗰兩個仔呢

369
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
係喺別斯巴做士司

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
先特別提呢個地方呢

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
可能有兩個原因

372
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
第一個原因呢

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
就係頭先我哋睇薩姆爾要去秦嘅地方呢

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
原來同別斯巴相距好遠嘅

375
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
究竟係咪佢想安排個仔

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
既然個衰仔咁衰

377
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
我安排到去遠啲去邊疆

378
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
喺最南嘅地方都叫做有個士司

379
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
呢個可能係一個可能性

380
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
第二個可能性

381
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
就係可以交代薩姆爾可能係山高皇帝遠

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
即係話個仔去到咁遠咁衰

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
我都冇乎啦

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
究竟係咩原因呢

385
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
但係你有你嘅囚謀

386
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
但係人係看在眼內

387
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
呢個都係提醒我哋做領導嘅

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
我都要注意

389
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
我哋好似諗咗好多嘢

390
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
但係其實所有嘅弟兄姊妹

391
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
所有嘅人係睇在眼內

392
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
結果嗰班嘅長老要去搵薩姆爾攤牌

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
要去搵薩姆爾攤牌

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
講咩呢

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
喺八章四至五節

396
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
以色列嘅長老都聚集

397
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
嚟到拉馬見薩姆爾

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
你老啦你年幾老埋

399
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
你嘅仔又唔行你嘅道

400
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
而家求你為我哋立一個王

401
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
治理我哋好似列國一樣

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
我哋睇聖經呢

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
你就咁睇完呢

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
一啲都唔震撼嘅

405
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
年幾老啦我仔唔掂啦

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
立一個王

407
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
但係立一個王呢句嘢

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
係薩姆爾諗都冇諗過

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
可能嗰日個氣氛好緊張

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
一眾長老

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
竟然間嚟到佢屋企

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
然之後坐低

413
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
要同佢攤牌嘅時候

414
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
可能薩姆爾頂多都只係話

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
你個仔唔得啦

416
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
我數晒你個仔啲劣行

417
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
而家唔該你退位

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
我要搵第二個做事師

419
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
肯定佢只不過係咁諗

420
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
佢絕對冇諗過

421
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
係要求一個王

422
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
點解我話震撼呢

423
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
原來呢個王係以色列

424
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
係未出現過

425
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
原來事師嘅制度已經400年

426
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
突然間呢一班嘅長老話

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
我要推翻埋過往400年

428
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
嘅事師制度

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
我要好似其他國家

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
咁立一個王

431
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
咁立一個王

432
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
呢個係以色列嘅歷史上

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
第一次係放棄神智

434
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
如果你所認識

435
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
我哋有史以嚟可能有幾個制度

436
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
就係君主嘅制度

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
另一個就係民主嘅制度

438
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
以色列以前一路行嘅係神智

439
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
由神去管治嘅制度

440
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
佢哋嫌棄上帝

441
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
如果大家係薩姆爾

442
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
當班長老咁樣嚟搵你攤牌嘅時候

443
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
要廢咗你兩個仔

444
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
仲要廢埋呢個事師制度

445
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
我唔知你會點做

446
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
你會就範

447
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
你會抗議

448
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
我唔知道

449
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
但係薩姆爾

450
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
冇搵埋一班人

451
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
然之後去再同呢班長老抗衡

452
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
薩姆爾做咗一件事

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
雖然薩姆爾係好唔開心

454
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
你睇薩姆爾記上八章六節

455
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
薩姆爾不喜悅

456
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
他們說立一個王

457
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
治理我哋

458
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
但係

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
跟住嗰幾個字

460
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
佢就討告耶和華

461
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
慶幸佢做嘅第一件事係祈禱

462
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
佢先得到上帝親自對佢安慰

463
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
一陣你睇呢

464
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
係好美麗嘅一幅圖畫

465
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
嘩上帝親自安慰薩姆爾

466
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
因為相信薩姆爾一定好唔開心

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
佢撲心撲命

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
頭先嗰個退休演詞裏面

469
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
都睇到真係佢一個

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
冇可指責嘅一個領袖

471
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
唔計佢兩個仔

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
但係竟然間啲人唔要佢

473
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
慶幸佢搵上帝討告

474
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
佢最後都能夠退休退得好光彩

475
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
所以先有嗰個演說

476
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
同埋下一次會討論

477
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
雖然佢退休

478
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
但係佢繼續做新嘅王嘅顧問

479
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
繼續做佢嘅顧問

480
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
但係呢個都唔係最重要

481
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
最重要係佢親自得到上帝嘅安慰

482
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
所以喺第八章第七節裏面話

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
耶穌話對薩姆爾話

484
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
睇下上帝點安慰佢

485
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
佢話百姓向你所講嘅一切話

486
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
你只管依從

487
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
因為佢哋唔係厭棄你

488
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
乃係厭棄我

489
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
唔要我做佢哋嘅王

490
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
上帝點安慰薩姆爾

491
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
佢話你依從

492
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
你儘管去做

493
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
佢哋唔係厭棄你

494
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
佢係厭棄我

495
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
如果大家係薩姆爾

496
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
聽完呢段說話

497
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
你會唔會舒服少少

498
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
都可能會可以

499
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
點解呢

500
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
因為可能如果你係薩姆爾

501
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
如果我係薩姆爾

502
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
可能一嚟到

503
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
人哋第一句就話

504
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
你年紀老埋啦

505
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
即係話我老啦

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
跟住佢又會即刻轉牛角尖

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
係啦我老啦我仔冇用啦

508
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
所以同埋仲有

509
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
佢要揹咗隻好大好大好大嘅鑊

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
就係乜嘢

511
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
喺歷史遺留

512
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
就係話以後薩姆爾

513
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
要揹隻好大嘅鑊

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
就係話因為你

515
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
人哋先唔要事先呢個制度

516
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
即係你要揹住四百年

517
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
有個制度個個好大嘅包袱

518
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
我諗薩姆爾個壓力會好大

519
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
因為我哋可能有時

520
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
我哋想唔開就係咁㗎啦

521
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
一想唔開一轉牛角尖

522
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
就係話我係話老啦

523
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
哎呀話我唔識教仔

524
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
哎呀令到個制度唔要啦咁

525
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
全部嘢你會攬晒上身

526
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
頂紙媒原來有時我哋轉牛角尖

527
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
就係令到我哋瞓唔著覺

528
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
令到我哋啲血壓

529
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
又升又降

530
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
嗰個根源

531
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
所以我哋上一次搞咗一個

532
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
全溫歌華都知嘅講座

533
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
因為登咗好耐廣告

534
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
不過有啲弟兄姐妹冇嚟

535
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
就係呢一個

536
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
我哋搵咗一個專家

537
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
然之後搞咗一個講座

538
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
聽完之後

539
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
有嚟嗰啲人都覺得

540
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
哎呀冇走寶呀咁樣

541
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
我問咗佢准許

542
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
我先用返佢兩張powerpoint

543
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
因為有弟兄姐妹真係話

544
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
學到嘢

545
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
嗰度講呢就係一個

546
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
減壓嘅思考模式

547
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
正正就係我一陣間會

548
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
喺撒妹嗰度去抄橋落嚟

549
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
原來我哋一齊都可以用呢個方法

550
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
咁佢就話呢就叫災難化

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
咩叫災難化呢

552
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
原來有個思考模式呢

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
係咁樣減壓嘅

554
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
就好簡單嘅啫

555
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
叫做A B C

556
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
咩叫A B C呢

557
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
原來呢A呢

558
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
就係話一個嘅事件

559
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
即係發生嗰件事

560
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
咁嗰日呢

561
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
專家呢就講個例子

562
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
其實Marinda同我哋好熟嘅

563
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
咁呢Marinda就舉咗個例子

564
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
就係話呢A事件

565
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
佢話老闆心情唔好

566
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
同你大發脾氣

567
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
呢個事實

568
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
一返嚟

569
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
唔知你有冇試過呢

570
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
我有試過

571
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
一返到去呢

572
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
就老闆係咁鬧中用粗口

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
好勁咁鬧

574
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
我都唔知點解佢咁流利嘅

575
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
鬧咗半個鐘

576
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
我都唔知咩事

577
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
一返嚟

578
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
鬧中半個鐘

579
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
好啦

580
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
呢件事件嚟㗎喎

581
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
俾人鬧中半個鐘

582
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
咁就去到B咗喎

583
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
咁我哋就會諗啦

584
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
哎呀

585
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
老闆好憎我啦

586
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
要將我封殺啦

587
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
我哋就會即刻諗㗎喎

588
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
係咪我唔好呢

589
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
因為鬧你梗係你唔好啦

590
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
你覺得

591
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
結果去到C

592
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
你嘅反應就係話

593
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
哎呀慘啦

594
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
災難嚟到啦

595
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
大難臨頭啦

596
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
結果你開始呢

597
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
下午食飯嘅時候呢

598
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
又開始睇報紙啦

599
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
睇下啲搵工嗰啲招聘廣告啦

600
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
呢個好容易就係會有A

601
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
會有B

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
會有C

603
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
咁老師就解釋啦

604
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
佢話

605
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
我哋一定會咁樣

606
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
一路循序而落

607
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
咁但係其實實情係咪真係咁呢

608
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
係咪你所諗嘅B咁樣諗呢

609
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
佢老闆無端端鬧你

610
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
無端端老闆

611
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
做乜咁憎你呢

612
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
咁上堂嘅時候呢

613
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Miranda就鼓勵我哋諗下

614
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
有咩例子呢

615
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
可以改變成為正面嘅思考呢

616
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
咁我就諗

617
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
不如咁

618
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
當老闆鬧完我之後

619
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
等到老闆擺明下咗火啦

620
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
可能收返張票返嚟啦

621
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
有返啲笑容啦

622
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
咁就走去問下老闆

623
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
老闆呀

624
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
我想問呢

625
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
昨日呢你咁樣

626
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
即係

627
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
鬧我發呢

628
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
究竟我有咩出錯呢

629
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
我好想改善呀

630
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
我唔想再避免以後再犯錯呀咁

631
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
呢個積極啲嘅方法

632
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
走去問老闆

633
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
可能老闆就同你解釋返

634
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
哎呀唔好意思呀

635
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
其實唔關你事㗎

636
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
就係昨日呢我出門口嘅時候呢

637
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
我就畀老婆鬧完

638
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
老婆叫我買樣嘢

639
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
我買咗成年都買唔到

640
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
咁就畀老婆鬧

641
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
你知啦

642
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
我老婆仲惡過我㗎嘛

643
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
咁所以你呀

644
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
你有第一個畀我見到嘅人

645
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
咁你唔好彩囉

646
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
咁樣

647
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
不如咁啦

648
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
一陣間食飯

649
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
我請你食飯啦

650
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
咁樣

651
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
哎

652
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
原來成件事好唔同喎

653
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
原來你只一個喺度災難化諗嗰樣嘢

654
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
原來根本就唔關你事

655
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
只不過有啲老闆就係會久唔久

656
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
發下脾氣

657
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
所以當

658
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
老師教完我哋

659
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
負面

660
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
即係減壓嘅ABC之後呢

661
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
我就諗到睇完殺母耳機嘅時候

662
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
我就睇

663
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
咦

664
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
我哋可以用一個基督徒嘅處理壓力

665
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
同埋面對負面情緒嘅方式

666
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
呢個係咁嘅

667
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
都係有A

668
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
就係嗰件事件一定會發生嘅

669
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
我哋一定會經歷大大小小唔開心

670
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
令到我哋有壓力嘅事件

671
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
然之後我加咗一個

672
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
就係P

673
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
呢個大嘅P

674
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
呢個大嘅P就係Pray

675
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
就係祈禱

676
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
當一有咩事嘅時候

677
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
我唔係想你即刻諗啲辦法

678
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
去報仇又好

679
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
去自己用好多辦法

680
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
我哋試下當有唔開心嘅時候一嚟

681
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
你先擺個P落去

682
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
個A一發生

683
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
你一定會有好多機會嘅

684
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
發生個A

685
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
你先唔好自己唔開心住

686
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
你祈禱

687
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
你求上帝畀智慧你

688
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
結果上兩星期一位姐妹同我傾

689
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
佢一傾就話你傳到死啦

690
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
你哋一講就話死啦

691
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
死啦

692
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
咁雖然你一諗會死呢

693
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
就諗星期四返嚟呢個講座啦

694
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
教你點死啦

695
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
唔係即係死嘅安排

696
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
我哋唔會教人死嘅

697
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
但你就成日呢都話死啦

698
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
我話咩事呀

699
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
佢話我做嗰個機構呢

700
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
有個人好難應付嘅

701
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
成日大發脾氣嘅

702
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
但有樣嘢呢

703
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
我要親自去同佢講呀

704
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
我唔知應該點算呀

705
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
跟住我話

706
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
不如咁啦

707
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
我就即刻教佢ABC

708
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
然之後加個P喺度

709
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
我話呢個人好難應付

710
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
成日大發脾氣

711
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
你就加個P

712
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
你祈禱

713
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
求上帝畀智慧你

714
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
你未必係畀佢鬧到

715
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
即係狗血淋頭嘅

716
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
結果隔咗幾日我問返佢

717
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
我話嗰件事點呀

718
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
佢話

719
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
我真係stupid呀

720
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
即係佢係講中文

721
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
不過中文好似

722
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
冇咁文雅呀

723
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
佢話我真係stupid呀

724
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
佢話點解

725
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
都冇嘢

726
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
原來佢都冇嘢

727
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
我祈完土之後同佢傾計

728
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
佢都不知幾好相遇對我

729
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
仲笑笑口咁樣

730
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
有時就係咁樣

731
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
我哋自己騰雞咗

732
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
自己災難化咗

733
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
成件事先

734
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
所以感謝上帝

735
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
我哋有禱告嘅福分

736
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
以後遇到有啲咩嘅難處

737
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
你先加個P字

738
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
A係唔會變㗎

739
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
嗰件事

740
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
但係你加完個P呢

741
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
我保證

742
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
嗰個B同嗰個C

743
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
可以好唔同

744
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
因為咁樣

745
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
撒姆爾好唔喜悅

746
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
但係佢一祈禱

747
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
上帝就知道

748
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
佢唔喜悅嘅根源係邊度

749
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
所以上帝安慰佢話

750
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
因為佢哋唔係厭棄你

751
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
而係厭棄我

752
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
點解佢哋要一個國家嘅王呢

753
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
可能佢哋好想好似其他國家咁

754
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
要有一個具體嘅人

755
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
嚟到去帶領佢哋

756
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
所以佢想話

757
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
我都要學其他國家

758
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
有個王

759
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
然之後上帝就同撒姆爾講話

760
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
但係你要話畀佢聽

761
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
去到第九節

762
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
故此你要依從佢哋嘅話

763
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
只是當警戒佢哋

764
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
當你個仔

765
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
一定要揀嗰科大學嗰科

766
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
你都要試下警戒佢

767
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
睇下佢聽唔聽

768
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
跟住呢

769
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
撒姆爾就用咗好多

770
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
上帝嘅啟示畀佢聽

771
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
如果你哋要揀個王呢

772
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
咁樣啦

773
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
第一

774
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
佢哋就要捉咗你個仔

775
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
去趕車

776
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
去趕馬

777
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
然之後又要

778
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
搵佢哋去耕種田地

779
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
打造兵器

780
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
你嘅女兒呢

781
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
佢哋就會捉咗去製造

782
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
香糕做飯烤餅

783
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
最好嘅田地橄欖園

784
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
同埋葡萄園呢

785
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
就要俾埋個軍王

786
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
然之後呢

787
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
你哋本身嘅仆人婢女

788
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
你哋嘅健壯嘅少年人呢

789
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
又要走去看農

790
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
仲有最緊要

791
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
就係話

792
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
你所選嘅王

793
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
你遲啲會因為咁

794
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
而哀求耶和華

795
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
但耶和華

796
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
唔會理你

797
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
道理就講得好清楚

798
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
交代曬畀啲

799
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
子子女女聽

800
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
仔仔女女聽

801
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
結果去到撒姆爾記上

802
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
八章十九至二十節

803
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
嗰啲百姓點回應呢

804
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
百姓竟不肯聽撒姆爾嘅話

805
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
就話

806
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
唔要

807
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
我哋一定要一個王

808
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
去治理我哋

809
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
跟住然之後撒姆爾

810
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
就同佢哋講

811
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
因為上帝提咗佢話

812
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
你只管依從佢哋嘅話

813
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
為佢哋納王

814
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
撒姆爾對以色列人話

815
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
你哋各歸各成去吧

816
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
即係唔好負啦

817
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
你返去啦

818
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
上帝會照你嘅意思去做

819
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
究竟上帝嘅選民

820
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
揀咗皇帝個下場會點呢

821
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
我哋下次會開始討論

822
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
下次講撒姆爾同埋數羅嘅時候

823
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
我哋會再做思考

824
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
喺未結束祈禱之前

825
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
我好想畀大家知道

826
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
世界上應該冇一個制度

827
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
係完美嘅

828
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
君主制度唔得

829
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
民主制度更唔得

830
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
我哋最緊要係擁抱我哋嘅上帝

831
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
特別我哋而家

832
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
我哋講緊好多嘅選舉

833
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
你睇嗰啲人嘅選舉策略

834
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
好似只不過一路去抹黑其他人

835
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
係咪呀

836
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
佢又抹黑佢

837
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
佢又抹黑佢

838
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
好似話畀人哋聽

839
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
我冇佢咁衰

840
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
就得㗎啦

841
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
而事實上係嘅英文係less evil

842
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
可能我哋只不過喺呢班人裏面

843
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
去揀一個less evil

844
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
冇咁衰

845
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
但係我哋都要盡嗰個責任

846
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
我哋去祈禱

847
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
求上帝去感動我哋

848
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
究竟我哋投邊一邊

849
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
我哋琴晚團契先講話

850
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
我哋基督徒係有責任

851
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
我諗大家如果有過一票

852
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
都係有責任

853
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
我哋去投

854
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
我哋唔好唔投之後

855
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
跟住又話

856
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
冇理由投佢

857
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
冇理由唔投佢

858
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
但係竟然間之後

859
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
你係冇行動

860
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
我哋都係一個管家

861
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
我哋好好管好我哋嗰一票

862
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
去祈願土之後

863
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
究竟我哋投去邊一度

864
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
當我哋去到重大決定嘅時候

865
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
最後一次我哋睇約翰一書

866
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
關於祈禱

867
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
跟住我就會有首詩歌

868
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
好想送畀大家

869
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
約翰一書五章十四十五節嗰度講

870
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
我哋若按照佢嘅旨意求什麼

871
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
佢就聽我哋

872
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
這時我哋向佢所傳坦言無懼嘅心

873
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
既然知道佢聽我哋一切所祈求嘅

874
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
就知道我哋所祈求佢的

875
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
無不得著

876
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
無不得著

877
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
我哋一齊有個託告

878
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
呢一刻相信

879
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
有部分嘅弟兄姊妹

880
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
可能都帶住唔同嘅傷痛

881
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
或者你諗到一啲

882
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
有傷痛嘅人

883
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
可能我哋覺得

884
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
人生行到一個困境

885
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
可能我哋睇到

886
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
前路

887
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
係黑暗

888
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
我哋好似自己用咗我哋所有嘅方法

889
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
我哋都改變唔到

890
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
目前嘅困境

891
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
求你呢一刻

892
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
教到我哋

893
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
點樣託告

894
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
我哋知道我哋係軟弱

895
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
但係都知道你係會擁抱

896
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
我哋知道我哋唔可以

897
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
但係知道上帝你可以

898
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
求你嘅靈親字安慰我哋每一個受傷嘅靈魂

899
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
讓我哋懂得

900
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
我哋可以靠住你

901
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
最後可以跨性

902
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
讓我哋懂得我哋能夠坦然無懼

903
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
嚟到你嘅面前

904
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
因為你係嗰個愛我哋嘅爸爸

905
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
你最知道我哋呢一刻痛苦嘅根源

906
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
因為冇人會明白我哋

907
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
或者我哋自己都唔明白

908
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
但求上帝你同我哋同在

909
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
我哋知道最終我哋會跨性

910
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
我哋咁嘅託告係奉主嘅命求

911
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
阿姆
