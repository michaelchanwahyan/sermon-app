00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Hello, friends and sisters. I am Hsu. Welcome to our 10-part lecture.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Today's topic is "Who is my mentor?"

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 "Three-level understanding"

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 The content is in the 10th chapter of the Old Testament, 25-37, the parable of Osama bin Laden.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 The scripture is in the Old Testament. Let me read it.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 A lawmaker came up to Jesus and said, "Teacher, what should I do to be eternal?"

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Jesus said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 He replied, "You must do your best to love your God and love the Lord as yourself."

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Jesus said, "You are right. Your actions are life."

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 The man wanted to prove himself right, so he said to Jesus, "Who is my mentor?"

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Jesus replied, "There was a man who came down from Jerusalem and fell into the hands of the robbers.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 They took off his clothes and beat him to death.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 He was taken away by a man.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 A priest saw him coming down from the road and walked by him.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 A man from Nimeh saw him and walked by him.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 A man from Samaria saw him and fell in love with him.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 He poured wine on his wounds and wrapped them up.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 He carried him on his back and took him to the inn to take care of him.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 The next day he took two silver coins and handed them to the innkeeper and said,

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 "Please take care of him. I will return the money I have taken when I return."

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 "Who is the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?"

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 He said, "It is the man who is in his name."

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Jesus said, "You go and do as you have done."

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I will divide this passage into two parts.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 The latter part is the conversation from 25 to 29.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 After the conversation, Jesus will talk about the prophecy from 30 to 37.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Today I will first introduce some background information.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 For example, some people, some cultures, and some interpretations of the Bible at the time.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Then I will first look at this passage in the first level.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Then I will point out the place where the passage is found.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Then I will look at this passage twice in the third and fourth parts.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I will look at these two passages in different depths.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Before concluding, I will try to explain what it means to "endure forever"

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 and how to follow God's command and obey God's law.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 The background of this story is from a geographical perspective.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 From the city of Jerusalem to Jericho.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 The city of Jerusalem is located at an altitude of 2,400 meters above the mountain.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Jericho is 720 meters below the waterline.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So the difference in altitude is 3,170 meters.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 What does this height mean?

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 If you have lived in Hong Kong, you know that the highest mountain in Hong Kong is called the Great Wall Mountain.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 The height of the Great Wall Mountain is 3,140 meters.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 So it is equivalent to 17 miles from the Great Wall Mountain to the waterline.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 This is the background of the geography.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 The picture next to it shows that many of the mountains are sloping.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 It is quite dangerous.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 It is difficult to detect if there is a force hiding behind it.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 This is the metaphor used by Jesus Christ in this background.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 There are a few things I want to clarify.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 First, the word "God who is full of heart, full of mind, full of strength, full of love, and full of love for you"

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 and "love the Lord and love yourself"

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 are related to love in the Hellenistic text.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But today we want to talk about "love God" and "love the Lord"

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 in the Hellenistic text.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The word "Akabe" refers to God's love for people.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 This is the most important love.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 It is a love without selfishness and conditions.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 That is to say, the love we are talking about today,

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 the love of God, the love of the Holy Spirit,

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 is to meet the moral range of God's love for the Holy Spirit.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It is just a love without selfishness.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It is not about love between family members.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 There is another word for love between family members,

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 love between men and women, and love between friends.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 The love we are talking about today is the love between God and people.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 It is like God's love for people in the Christian world.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 If we use the Interlinear Bible on the Internet,

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 we will see the words of the Hellenistic text.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 If you click into each word of the Hellenistic text,

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 there is an English translation.

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 The word "heart" refers to thoughts or feelings,

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 the heart of a person, the heart of your thoughts.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 The word "soul" refers to the word "soul"

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 in the Old Testament when Adam was created,

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 God breathed into Adam, and Adam had the spirit of life.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So the Holy Spirit, which is all your life,

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 came to love God together.

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 The word "power" is easier to understand,

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 which means to use all your ability,

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 your method to love God.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 The word "soul" refers to a deep level of thought,

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 which means you need a will.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 In addition to emotional thought,

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 we also need a will.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 This is very important.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 When we finally explain the love of the Holy Spirit,

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I will go back to why these four things are together.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 This wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly,

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 wholeheartedly love God and love the Holy Spirit and yourself,

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 this sentence is not in the Old Testament.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Because this sentence is actually composed of two Old Testament verses.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 The first part of "Love God" is mentioned in the sixth chapter of the Bible.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 In the 49th chapter of the Leviticus,

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 there is a second part of "Love God, Love Your Spirit, Love Yourself."

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I want everyone to pay attention to the three words "wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly"

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 in the Old Testament.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Some books of the Gospels explain this.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Because in the Hebrew text,

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 the first word "wholeheartedly" includes the meaning of "wholeheartedly."

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So in the Old Testament, it means "wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly."

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 In the Bible, it means "wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly love God."

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Because it is clearly defined in the Hebrew text.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 These two greatest revolutions were not mentioned for the first time.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 In Matthew 12 and 22,

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 there were two prophets or lawmakers

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 who debated or tested the knowledge of the Bible.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 At that time, these two prophets or lawmakers

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 asked the same question,

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 which one is the most important among the revolutions?

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Jesus answered, "Wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly love God, your God, and love yourself."

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 This time, the lawmaker's question was different from the one asked by Jesus before the prophecy.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 He asked, "Teacher, what should I do?"

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 What can I do to be eternal?

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 It is not about which one is the most important.

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 The lawmaker had prepared his answer.

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So when Jesus asked him how to write the law,

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 he immediately came up with the answer.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 He asked himself and answered himself.

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 The motivation of this conversation, if we look at the Bible,

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 the lawmaker tested Jesus.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 This test may not necessarily mean to make him suffer.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Because we saw two examples before.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Some scholars really think that Jesus came out to explain the Bible like a scholar.

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Many people followed him.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 He said something more authoritative.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 They wanted to debate with him to see if he was telling the truth or not.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I think it's a test in this form to see how much he could weigh.

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It's a way of debating with him.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So when he talked to Jesus, he also called Jesus as a teacher.

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 After answering Jesus,

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 he debated with him to prove that he was right.

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But if we look at the structure of the whole debate, it is very special.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 At the beginning, the lawmaker challenged Jesus like a teacher.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Jesus answered the same way.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Let's look at the first paragraph.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 The lawmaker asked what he could do to be eternal.

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Notice that Jesus did not answer this question.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Jesus used a question-and-answer method to ask how to write the law.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 How to understand.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 How to read.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 How to understand.

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Why did Jesus ask two questions?

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Because you know how to write the law.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 If your understanding is wrong, it is wrong.

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 So he asked two questions.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 The lawmaker answered.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 He already had an answer.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 He answered with all his heart, all his strength, etc.

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I am God and I am written for myself.

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Jesus made a conclusion.

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 You are right.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 This is how to live.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 This is the first dialogue.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The second dialogue has the same structure.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 The lawmaker asked again who is my successor?

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Jesus did not answer.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Jesus asked again who is the successor of this victim?

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 This led the lawmaker to answer.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 It is the question-and-answer method.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Jesus made a conclusion.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 You are right.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 So at first, Jesus was like a debate.

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 The lawmaker was like a judge.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Jesus made a very ingenious dialogue.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 He became the main speaker.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 The lawmaker became the answerer.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I have four dialogues with four people.

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I want to compare them with you.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Because these four passages are related to our explanation today.

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 We noticed that Jesus talked to different people.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 There are different ways to discuss the truth.

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Sometimes it is very similar.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 But there are also different ways.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 For example, he and Nebuchadnezzar

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 were recording in the Book of Revelation.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 When talking about resurrection,

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Nebuchadnezzar could not figure out how to

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 resurrect the story in his mother's womb.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Jesus directly explained to him

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 "If man is not born again from water and the Holy Spirit,

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 he cannot enter the kingdom of God."

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He said that only those who are resurrected by the Holy Spirit

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 can enter heaven.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 He directly explained the truth.

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 For Nebuchadnezzar,

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 there was a dialogue.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Nebuchadnezzar's question was the same as the lawmaker's.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 What should I do to be resurrected?

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Jesus directly explained his biggest question.

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 You have to change everything to follow me.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Because Jesus saw people's hearts.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 He knew this was his biggest problem.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 What you can't do is your problem.

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 In the Book of Revelation,

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 there is a story about a man from Palestine,

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Simon, who invited Jesus to his house.

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But he did not treat Jesus politely.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 He did not wash his feet with him.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 He respected Jesus as a guest.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 But at that time, a woman who was drunk

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 went to Jesus and washed his feet with tears.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 She used her hair to wipe his feet.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Jesus asked Simon a question.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 If a creditor has two creditors,

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 one owes 500 and the other 50,

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 and the creditor also exempts the two people from debt,

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 which creditor will be more grateful to the creditor?

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Will he love more?

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Simon's answer was that

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 the one who has more credit will love the creditor more.

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 This story is related to today's story.

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I will tell you again when I meet you.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Today we will talk about the Lawyer.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 After two conversations with Jesus Christ,

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 he told the truth.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 This is the Lawyer, the one who taught others.

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 We will now look at the content of these scriptures.

218
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 There are different types of people mentioned here.

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 What kind of people are the Lawyer and the Priest?

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 At that time, the Jews were ruled by the Romans.

221
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 So politically they were powerless.

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Militarily they were powerless.

223
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 But among the people,

224
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 they had a court.

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 The Lawyer was appointed by the Roman Empire.

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 They established a religious court

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 to govern the internal affairs of the Jews,

228
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 especially religious affairs.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Among them, the Lawyer and the Priest

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 were the most important people in the power center.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 The Lawyer and the Priest could only be

232
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 the descendants of Aaron.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Aaron was the brother of Moses

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 when he went to Egypt.

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 So he could only be the descendant of Aaron.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Aaron was also a Lawyer.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 If you are a Lawyer,

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 but not from Aaron's family,

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 you are responsible for other religious affairs.

240
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 These are the assistants.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 These are the assistants of the Lawyer.

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 They were all responsible for the work in the temple.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It is recorded that

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 there were about 18,000 Lawyers in the time of Jesus.

245
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 They served in the temple in turns.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Father John was one of the Lawyers.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Among the Lawyers,

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 there were 22 people from the Lawyers and the Priest.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 So they were another power center.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They were familiar with the Bible

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 and strictly followed the rules of the Bible.

252
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But at that time, Jesus criticized them

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 and said that their hearts were far from God.

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 They said that they were reverent and devoted to God,

255
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 but their hearts were far from God.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 They did not respect God.

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 At the same time,

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 their concept of enemies

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 was wrong according to Jesus' teaching.

260
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Because Jesus told them

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 that they should listen to the commandment

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 "Love your neighbor as you hate your enemy."

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 But Jesus taught them

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 that they should love their enemies.

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The persecuted should pray.

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 The persecuted should pray.

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 It means that when you love your neighbor,

268
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 your neighbor includes your enemy.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It doesn't mean you should hate your enemy.

270
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Why did they have a wrong concept?

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Because if they look back at the Old Testament,

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 it mentioned what a neighbor was.

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 The Bible says that

274
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 the neighbor is your people.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Don't love your neighbor in any way.

276
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Your neighbor is your people.

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And in the 34th chapter of the Old Testament,

278
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 the neighbor is your people.

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It means that the people who are your people

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 should love them as they love themselves.

281
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 This is the concept of their neighbor at that time.

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 My people, Jews,

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 or the people who are our people.

284
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 But when it comes to Jesus,

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 they narrowed the scope even more.

286
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Why?

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Because these people who obey the law

288
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 look down on other Jews,

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 such as tax collectors and criminals.

290
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Although they are all Jews,

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 they are all from the same tribe,

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 they think their behavior is not correct.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 They may be greedy,

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 cheat, defraud, or commit crimes.

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 They are greedy.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Although they are Jews,

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 they do not regard them as their neighbors.

298
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 They only regard those they love

299
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 as their neighbors.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 For the foreigners,

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 they must be regarded as their enemies.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 So after the fall of the Roman Empire,

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Solomon became king.

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 After Solomon's death,

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 the country was divided into two parts.

306
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Of the twelve branches,

307
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 two branches formed the South,

308
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 that is, the Jewish state.

309
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Ten branches on the north side are the Israeli state.

310
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 The southernmost branch is Jerusalem,

311
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 and the northernmost branch is Samaria.

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Samaria could not go to Jerusalem to worship,

313
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 so it was buried in the city of Sidon.

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 When the Assyrian Empire destroyed the Israeli state,

315
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 they moved the Israelis to different places.

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Many foreigners moved to this place.

317
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 The remaining Israelis married the foreigners.

318
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 When they were married,

319
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 they were no longer pure Israelis.

320
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So the Jews on the south side

321
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 did not like them.

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 They thought they were a group of

323
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 non-pure Israelis.

324
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 At the same time,

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 they worshiped other than the Bible,

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 they did not believe in other scriptures.

327
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 They did not believe in religion,

328
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 and they also worshiped other idols.

329
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 After the two countries were divided,

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 the Israeli state once helped foreigners

331
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 to try to attack the Jewish state.

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 So the Jews on the south side hate the people on the north side.

333
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 When the Jews could return to build the temple,

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 the Samaritans once stopped them from building the temple.

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 They wanted to participate.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 In the age of Jesus,

337
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 these two regions were a joint province.

338
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It was ruled by the Romans.

339
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But the Jews on the south side

340
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 did not want to associate with the Samaritans on the north side.

341
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 So when they wanted to go to Galilee,

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 they often walked along the right side of the Jordan River,

343
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 instead of passing through the Samaritan area.

344
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Because they did not like the Samaritans.

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Why did they not like them?

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 When the Jews wanted to slander Jesus,

347
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 they insulted Jesus.

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 They said to Jesus,

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 "We say that you are a Samaritan and a Christian."

350
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 They added the worst of the two things to Jesus.

351
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 This is how the Jews slandered Jesus at that time.

352
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So you can see that the Jews at that time

353
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 were as bad as the Samaritans.

354
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 At the same time,

355
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 there is a record in the Old Testament.

356
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Jesus went to Jerusalem.

357
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 At the end of the journey,

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 he passed through a village in Samaria.

359
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 The people there did not receive Jesus.

360
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Because they saw Jesus going to Jerusalem.

361
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So the people who went there were not our own people.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 At that time,

363
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 when the Jews saw that they did not greet Jesus,

364
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 they asked Jesus,

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 "Lord, can you tell us

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 to burn these Samaritans in the sky

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 to kill these people who do not receive us?"

368
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 So you can see that the hatred was very strong.

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Jesus turned to burn these two doors.

370
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So we see that the Jews and the Samaritans

371
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 are opposing each other.

372
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Let's look at the first level.

373
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Let's look at the first story.

374
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 At the beginning,

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 they had a conversation.

376
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 The pastor,

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 according to the background we just saw,

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 wanted to debate with Jesus to challenge him

379
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 to see how much Jesus knew about the Bible.

380
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 He asked, "What can I do to be eternal?"

381
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 This question is very important.

382
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Why?

383
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 The pastor did not ask,

384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 "What can I do to be a prophet?"

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 He saw that the most important thing was eternal life.

386
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So he asked this very important question to them.

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Since you are a pastor,

388
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 how do you write the law?

389
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 How do you understand?

390
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 He answered,

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 "This is the famous truth,

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 to love God and to love the Lord and yourself."

393
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Jesus said, "You are right.

394
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 If you do this, you will have life."

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 This man was not enough.

396
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 He wanted to prove himself right.

397
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 He told Jesus,

398
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 "Who is my Lord?"

399
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Jesus began to talk about the Samaritan's parable.

400
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 There are different characters in this parable.

401
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 The first character is a man who went from Jerusalem to Jericho.

402
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I just showed you the picture.

403
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 He went from a very high place to the mountain.

404
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 He met a group of robbers.

405
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 These robbers took off his clothes,

406
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 beat him to death,

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 and the other man left.

408
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 These sentences are meaningful.

409
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 First, they took off his clothes.

410
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 At that time, clothes were expensive.

411
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It was not like today,

412
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 where you can buy clothes at any time.

413
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 We can produce a lot of clothes at a low price.

414
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 But at that time, we had to work slowly.

415
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 There was no automated machine.

416
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So clothes were expensive.

417
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 So you can see that

418
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 when Jesus was nailed to the cross,

419
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 the soldiers took Jesus' clothes.

420
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 They took away a prisoner's clothes.

421
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Because clothes are important when it is cold.

422
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Clothes are not only valuable,

423
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 but also can express your identity.

424
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 No matter what class you are,

425
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 your clothes can reveal who you are.

426
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 For example,

427
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 if this man's clothes are a picture of a priest,

428
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 the priest and the Libyan may help him.

429
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But this man's clothes were all taken off

430
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and beaten to death.

431
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 So we look at these two people in the 31st chapter.

432
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 This priest is a leader of our church in modern times.

433
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 He is a pastor and a religious leader.

434
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 He should be a law-abiding person.

435
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 But he saw this man like this,

436
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 so he walked by and didn't help him.

437
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Then this Libyan,

438
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 in modern terms,

439
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 is a person who participates in the church.

440
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Many people, including our pastor,

441
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 the chairman, the pastor,

442
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and the pastor of the church,

443
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 are all like this.

444
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 When they see this man,

445
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 they all want to walk by.

446
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 It's strange.

447
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Why do these people who are passionate about religion

448
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 and actively participate in religious activities

449
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 ignore him?

450
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 There are different ways to spread the word.

451
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Mainly, they give a possibility.

452
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 This possibility is a common point.

453
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 They calculate their own safety and interests.

454
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Why calculate?

455
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Because if they stayed at that time,

456
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 if there was still violence,

457
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 they might be attacked.

458
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 They are not safe.

459
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And if this person was beaten to death,

460
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 and his whole body was bleeding,

461
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 if he was electrocuted,

462
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 he would not be vaccinated.

463
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Because they are responsible for serving the church.

464
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 If he was not vaccinated,

465
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 he would have to be vaccinated for seven days.

466
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 He could not go to work for seven days.

467
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So it would affect their work.

468
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 At the same time, this person was beaten to death.

469
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Even if he was saved, he might not be able to save him.

470
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 So he might not have time.

471
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 They might not bother him.

472
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 They just walked away.

473
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 This is actually a very important message.

474
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 No matter how a group of people actively participate in religion,

475
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 no matter their status, no matter their time,

476
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 if we do not have a united heart,

477
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 it is a big problem.

478
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 So Jesus is a rebel.

479
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Although these people have religious rituals,

480
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 but their hearts are not there.

481
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 But on the contrary, in chapter 32,

482
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 in chapter 33, there is a person who is the most annoying,

483
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 the most unbearable enemy of the Pharisees,

484
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 the Sanhedrin.

485
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 This person came and saw this injured person,

486
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 and he was moved.

487
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 First, in chapter 34, he used wine and oil to treat the wound.

488
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 He bandaged the wound.

489
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 The first thing he did was to immediately cure the person

490
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 with the wine and oil.

491
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Then he carried the person to his own body

492
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 to arrange a guesthouse to take care of him.

493
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 That is, he immediately needed to be cured

494
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 and then prepared for long-term care.

495
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 He didn't just leave right away.

496
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 He stayed the next day.

497
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Then he took two coins here.

498
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 According to the Bible,

499
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 one coin was the salary of the day.

500
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Two coins were enough to stay in this shop for about two weeks.

501
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 He handed it over to the shopkeeper.

502
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 In other words, in addition to being cured and helped by the injured person,

503
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 he also prepared for long-term care.

504
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 He asked the shopkeeper to take care of him.

505
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 The extra expenses.

506
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 The Samaritan did not write on the top of the page

507
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 how much extra expenses were required.

508
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 He did not mention the top.

509
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 When I came back, I had to pay you back.

510
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 He said he would come back and pay you back.

511
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Then he asked the lawyer

512
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 who was the victim of the three people,

513
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 the priest, the Samaritan and the Samaritan?

514
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 The lawyer said,

515
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 "He did not mention the Samaritan."

516
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Maybe he didn't want to see this word

517
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 because he didn't like this word, didn't like these people.

518
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 But he answered the answer,

519
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 "The Samaritan is the one who died."

520
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Then Jesus said, "You go and do as you did."

521
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 This is the first time we have seen the content of the story.

522
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 We can see some information clearly.

523
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Some people are not enough to see death.

524
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Some people we think are enemies.

525
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Instead, he is willing to be loving and active

526
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 to help those in need.

527
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 He will immediately treat them,

528
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 arrange long-term care,

529
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 and even prepare extra expenses.

530
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Then he will come back and see this person.

531
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Let's look at this story and ask a few questions.

532
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 When the lawyer asked, "Who is my adversary?"

533
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Who is this "I"?

534
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 The lawyer thought he was the priest.

535
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Who needs to be saved?

536
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 In this story, the person from Jerusalem to Jericho

537
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 may be a Jew.

538
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 But this person needs to be saved.

539
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 The group of people who hurt others are the "strong ones".

540
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 The people who need to be cared for are religious people,

541
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 priests and laymen.

542
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Although they have religious appearance,

543
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 they are not "the law of God" but "the law of the Lord".

544
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Who is the "law of God"?

545
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 This is the Samaritan with a "heart of words".

546
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 He uses his heart to lead people to act.

547
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 He is the "Lunar Stone" because he is the one who writes the covenant.

548
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 He will immediately save and help in the long run.

549
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 So if we look at the last sentence,

550
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 "You go to the Lord to act".

551
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 When we first read this story,

552
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 we may come to a conclusion that

553
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 you go to the Samaritan with a "heart of words"

554
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 to write the covenant.

555
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 You go to the Samaritan with a "heart of words"

556
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 to write the covenant.

557
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 So some priests use the name of the Samaritan

558
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 to change the name.

559
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 This is the first level of our understanding.

560
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But in this level of understanding,

561
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 we will encounter several problems.

562
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 What are the problems?

563
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 First, let's look at this passage again.

564
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 The priest asked Jesus,

565
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 "What can I do to be eternal?"

566
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Jesus replied,

567
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 "You go to the Lord to act."

568
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Why not "to follow the will of God"?

569
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 This is the first question we need to answer.

570
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Then Jesus Christ said,

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 "You go to the Lord to act."

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 What do these three "act" mean?

573
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Why not "to follow the will of God"?

574
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 The second question,

575
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 if we don't pay attention, we have to be careful.

576
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 I haven't paid attention to this question for many years.

577
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 The key is that when the priest asked,

578
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 "Who is my disciple?"

579
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I am him.

580
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 He thinks he is a disciple.

581
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And the disciple is the recipient.

582
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 But after hearing Jesus' words and guidance,

583
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 he said the answer.

584
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 The disciple is the one who is the disciple.

585
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 It's just the opposite.

586
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 At first, he was the disciple,

587
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 and the disciple was the recipient.

588
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Now his answer is,

589
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 "Who is the disciple?"

590
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 The disciple is the one who is the recipient.

591
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Originally, the disciple is the recipient,

592
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 now he is the recipient.

593
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 His whole cognition is completely reversed.

594
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Why is that?

595
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 So if we stay in the first level of understanding,

596
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 we can't see these contradictions.

597
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Not contradictions, but these characteristics.

598
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Why are they so strange?

599
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Then we have to look at the second level of understanding.

600
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Now I will try to divide the first part into 6 parts.

601
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

602
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 I will explain the meaning of these 6 sentences one by one.

603
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 First, the priest asked Jesus Christ,

604
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 "Teacher, what should I do to be saved?"

605
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 He asked a very important question.

606
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Not fame and wealth,

607
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 not how to be rich and powerful,

608
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 but how to have an eternal life.

609
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 He saw that this was the most important thing.

610
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 He asked, "What can I do to bear this?"

611
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 If we look at the Old Testament,

612
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 it is mentioned that the dead will wake up,

613
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 and the dead will be resurrected.

614
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 After resurrection, there are two results.

615
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Some are eternal,

616
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 some are always humiliated and despised.

617
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 There are two results.

618
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 He asked, "After I die and resurrect,

619
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 how can I have an eternal life?"

620
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 He said this was a very important question for him.

621
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 But he said, "What should I do?"

622
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 So the question is in the question itself.

623
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 What should I do?

624
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Why is this a question in the question itself?

625
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 If you ask the richest person in the city you live in,

626
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 if you go to him and knock on his door and ask him,

627
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 "What can I do to bear your property?"

628
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 This rich person will kick you out.

629
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Because to bear property is not to do anything for others,

630
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 but to be a person,

631
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 not a descendant of a rich person

632
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 or his designated successor.

633
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 It's a question of identity, not an issue of behavior.

634
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 So if we ask how to bear eternal life,

635
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 how to enter heaven,

636
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 the only answer is that our identity must become God's will.

637
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 It's not what I do,

638
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 it's not my behavior,

639
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 but my identity.

640
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 As long as I am God's will,

641
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 I can bear eternal life.

642
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 It's not what I do,

643
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 but my status.

644
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 So the question of being is not the question of doing.

645
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 It's the question of status,

646
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 which is being,

647
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 not the question of doing.

648
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 This is the first question,

649
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 the question of making mistakes.

650
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 The question of this young official is the same.

651
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 The question of making mistakes is the same.

652
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 It's not what I do that can earn eternal life.

653
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Eternal life depends on your status.

654
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 The only way to enter eternal life,

655
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 is to enter heaven.

656
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 It can only be a question of God's will.

657
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Let's look at the second sentence.

658
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 After the theologian asked,

659
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 because this is a theologian,

660
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Jesus asked how to write the law,

661
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 how to understand it.

662
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 I just explained that Jesus asked two important questions.

663
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Because you know how to write the law,

664
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 but your understanding is wrong,

665
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 it is also wrong.

666
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 This is the question of Jesus.

667
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 The most wonderful thing about Jesus is his question,

668
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 which made the theologian think again.

669
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 The theologian had prepared the answer,

670
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 when he asked Jesus,

671
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 he had prepared the answer.

672
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 He answered immediately,

673
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I am the God of all life, all power, all love,

674
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 and I love you more than myself.

675
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 This answer is different from the one Jesus asked,

676
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 which is the most important one in the world.

677
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Because his question is,

678
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 what do I do to earn eternal life,

679
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 which is not the most important one in the world.

680
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 But Jesus is very wonderful.

681
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Jesus answered him,

682
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 yes, you are right.

683
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 If you walk like this, you will have eternal life.

684
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 It is very strange.

685
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Walk means to walk for eternal life.

686
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Is there any mistake?

687
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Jesus Christ was very direct when he had a dialogue with Nehemiah.

688
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 He did not turn back,

689
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 did not let him think slowly.

690
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 He directly told him,

691
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 God loves all people,

692
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 even gave him his only son to them.

693
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 According to the verse,

694
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 those who believe in Jesus are not like the blind man who has eternal life.

695
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Those who have eternal life have to believe in Jesus Christ.

696
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Jesus Christ did not talk to Nehemiah directly.

697
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Why did he not talk to him directly?

698
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 We will see later why he was not so direct.

699
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Because when a person is proud,

700
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Jesus Christ is not so direct.

701
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Jesus answered this question,

702
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 you have to walk like this to have eternal life.

703
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Let's see if we can walk.

704
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 The Greek Apostle Paul clearly said,

705
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 "People are not pure by walking the law,

706
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 but because they believe in Jesus Christ."

707
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Not by walking the law,

708
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 because no one can be pure by walking the law.

709
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 If you can be pure by walking the law,

710
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Jesus Christ would have died in vain.

711
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 He did not need to die on the cross.

712
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Because we can't follow the law,

713
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 we can't follow the law completely.

714
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 So Jesus Christ would have died on the cross.

715
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 But when the Greek Apostle asked this question,

716
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 he thought from a self-centered perspective.

717
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 He did not think that the Bible was not written yet,

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 but we have a copy to see Paul's explanation.

719
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Paul said that Abraham believed in God

720
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 because he believed in God and was called a man.

721
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 He was called a man because of his faith.

722
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And those who follow the law are under the protection of God.

723
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Why?

724
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Because those who do not follow the law,

725
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 those who obey all the commandments, are under the protection of God.

726
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 It means that even if you can follow a part of the law,

727
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 but you can't follow all the commandments,

728
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 all the commandments are under the protection of God.

729
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 So there is a very obvious reason,

730
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 no one can be called a man by following the law in front of God.

731
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 You have to live by faith, not by doing.

732
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 So the question is,

733
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 why didn't Jesus directly say that he would do it?

734
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Why?

735
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Actually, Jesus' answer is that

736
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 he hoped that the Greek Apostle would listen to him,

737
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 and if he was sincere, he would answer Jesus.

738
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 He said, "Jesus, I can't do it, I can't follow the law."

739
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 If he was sincere, he would say so.

740
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 But he was not only not sincere,

741
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 he wanted to prove himself right,

742
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 and then ask another question.

743
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Why did Jesus ask this question?

744
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Let him know he can't do it.

745
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Let's compare two conversations.

746
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 The first conversation is in Luke 18,

747
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Jesus and this young official,

748
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 the rich official's conversation.

749
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 This person asked him what to do to be eternal.

750
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Jesus told him,

751
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 "You have missed one thing,

752
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 which is to become a poor man,

753
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 and then follow me."

754
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 Jesus did not tell him about the righteousness of faith.

755
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Jesus said that he could not do it.

756
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 So this person heard it and knew he could not do it,

757
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 and left with great sorrow,

758
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 because he was very rich.

759
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 He loved money more than he loved God.

760
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 In the parable of Samaria,

761
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Jesus asked him to do this,

762
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 that is, to love God, to love himself,

763
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 and then to be eternal.

764
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 This request was also not done by this lawmaker.

765
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 Like this young military officer,

766
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Jesus did not fulfill his request.

767
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 He was honest,

768
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 he told Jesus that he could not do it.

769
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 The White House did not do it.

770
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Instead, he had to prove that he was right,

771
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 and then asked, "Who is my messenger?"

772
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 These two sentences,

773
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 strictly speaking,

774
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 can be used as a topic for a lecture.

775
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Because I recently understood that

776
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 this sentence is very important.

777
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 I want to explain and prove that

778
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 I am right,

779
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 "Justify himself" means

780
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 "Justify" means to be called righteousness.

781
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 I want to explain two concepts.

782
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 The first concept is "Justification by Faith".

783
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 What is "Justification by Faith"?

784
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 God who is righteous

785
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 announces a righteous sinner as righteousness.

786
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Because this righteous sinner

787
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 believed in Jesus Christ and his cross.

788
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 So this righteous sinner's sin

789
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 was added to Jesus Christ.

790
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 He took responsibility for us on the cross.

791
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 At the same time,

792
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 the righteousness of the righteous Jesus Christ

793
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 was added to the guilty person

794
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 and was called and regarded as innocent.

795
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 This is "Justification by Faith".

796
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 What is "Justification by Faith"?

797
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 In English, it is "Self-Justification".

798
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 When an innocent sinner announces his righteousness,

799
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 I am right, you are wrong.

800
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 This is "Justification by Faith".

801
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 When a person wants to prove that he is right,

802
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 this is "Justification by Faith".

803
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Why do I explain this sentence?

804
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 If we think about our life,

805
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 we are often like this.

806
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Think about when we serve in the church,

807
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 when the brothers and sisters have different opinions,

808
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 we often argue in these discussions.

809
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 Everyone tries to prove that he is right.

810
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 A group of sinners to prove that

811
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 I am right, you are wrong.

812
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 When we are self-righteous,

813
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 when there is a dispute in the church,

814
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 when there is a division in the church,

815
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 we often serve in the church,

816
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 when we are in the family,

817
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 when we are at work,

818
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 when we are with other colleagues,

819
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 we often prove that we are right

820
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 as a sinner.

821
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 This is "Justification by Faith".

822
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 So when this Lawmaker

823
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 is sincere,

824
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 he should say that I can't do this,

825
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I can't keep these commandments.

826
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 He didn't say that.

827
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 He still has to prove that he is right.

828
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 A sinner in front of God of justice,

829
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 in front of the only righteous follower of Jesus Christ,

830
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 has to prove that he is right and Jesus is wrong.

831
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 So he asked Jesus,

832
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 "Who is my shepherd?"

833
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 This sentence is also very important.

834
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 If we look at it again,

835
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 "Who is my shepherd?"

836
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 What does it mean?

837
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 When he can't keep the law,

838
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 if he is sincere,

839
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 he knows that he can't do his best

840
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 to love God.

841
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 In fact, we can't keep it.

842
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Why?

843
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Every day we get up,

844
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 many times we value our career,

845
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 our family,

846
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 and the many things around us.

847
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 We turn our idols into God.

848
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 We often abuse God's name.

849
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Why do we abuse God's name?

850
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 When I call Jesus, "I am my Savior",

851
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 and I have to follow him,

852
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 my heart and my actions are far from him.

853
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 I call Jesus "my Savior",

854
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 "My Lord, my Lord",

855
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 actually insulting Jesus.

856
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 I am abusing his name.

857
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Because I don't treat him as my Lord.

858
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 When my heart is far from God,

859
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 I still call him Lord.

860
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 I am abusing his name.

861
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 We keep breaking the ten commandments.

862
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 This prophet can't keep the commandments.

863
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 He has to collect the proportion of the proportion.

864
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Because he doesn't love everyone.

865
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 He just wants to love those

866
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 who are pure and pure.

867
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 To prove himself right,

868
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 he can only love those

869
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 he chooses,

870
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 or those chosen by God,

871
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 not including the outsiders.

872
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 He tries to love those

873
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 he doesn't love,

874
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 such as the outsiders and his enemies.

875
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 So if you ask him,

876
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 "Who is my Savior?"

877
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 The same question is,

878
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 "Who is not my Savior?"

879
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 I can not love.

880
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 I have to love them.

881
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 If not, I don't have to love.

882
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 So he hopes,

883
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 not to follow the law,

884
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 but to not follow the commandments

885
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 in some cases.

886
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 He doesn't want to follow the commandments.

887
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 He wants to be certain

888
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 that he doesn't have to follow the commandments

889
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 if he chooses them.

890
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 Because I don't have to love them.

891
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 So his question is,

892
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 "In some cases,

893
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 how can I not follow the commandments?"

894
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 Or,

895
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 he wants to ask,

896
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 "Who can I not love?

897
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Who can I not love?"

898
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 He is asking this question.

899
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 So when the Lawyer asked,

900
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 "Who is my Savior?"

901
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 "I love my Savior."

902
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 That is, I give my Savior my own grace.

903
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 I am the "I" in the Self-Center.

904
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I am the "I" in the Self-Defense.

905
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 I am the "I" who is the Savior.

906
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 I don't need help.

907
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 He can't see that he needs compassion.

908
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 He thinks that others need to be graced.

909
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 He is the "I" who is the Savior.

910
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 So I want to share with you a saying.

911
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 A person is difficult to recognize in self-doubt.

912
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 He can't see that he is guilty.

913
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 On the contrary, a sinner

914
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 who knows his sins,

915
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 like those who follow Jesus,

916
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 the Pharisees, the sinners, the disciples,

917
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 they know their sins and follow Jesus.

918
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 A person in self-doubt,

919
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 no matter how high his status is,

920
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 he can't see that he is guilty.

921
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 So many people today

922
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 don't think they are guilty and need to find Jesus.

923
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 They think they are a good person.

924
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 OK.

925
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Let's briefly talk about

926
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 the first part of the sermon.

927
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 The problem of the Law of Correctness and Iniquity.

928
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Because entering the kingdom of heaven

929
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 is a matter of status.

930
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 It is not an act.

931
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 He knows how the law is written,

932
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 but his understanding is not accurate.

933
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 He can't guard the greatest of these revelations.

934
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 But he doesn't admit it.

935
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 On the contrary, he thinks he needs to

936
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 narrow the scope of the revelation.

937
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 So he thinks he is a sinner.

938
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 Let's look at the second part.

939
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 This is an example.

940
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 The first level,

941
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 I just mentioned,

942
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 I will briefly mention it to everyone.

943
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 The first level,

944
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 the Pharisees,

945
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 they think they are sinners.

946
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 They think the Jews who need to be saved

947
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 are the people who go to Jericho.

948
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 The strength of the hurt people

949
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 is not concerned with the people of the church.

950
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 The Pharisees are the ones who are

951
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 moved by the law.

952
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 They have a heart and action.

953
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 What do we see in the second level?

954
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 In the first level,

955
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 we see these things.

956
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 From the first level to the second level,

957
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 the key point is the question Jesus asked.

958
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 How did Jesus ask this question?

959
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 He said, "Who is the one who fell into the hands of the rapists?"

960
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 If I compare this sentence

961
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 to the question asked by the Pharisees,

962
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 the first level of the Pharisees,

963
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 they asked, "Who is my servant?"

964
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 This is me, himself.

965
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 He thought he was a sinner.

966
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 The servant is the recipient.

967
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Jesus asked him to turn from this perspective

968
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 to the question, "Who is the one who fell into the hands of the rapists?"

969
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 The person who was hurt.

970
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 Jesus asked this question

971
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 to turn the Pharisees' self-centeredness

972
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 from the fact that they do not need to be saved

973
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 and they think they are the recipients

974
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 to the perspective that they are the victims.

975
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 He thought about this question.

976
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 So this time Jesus was very ingenious

977
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 to change the perspective of the Pharisees.

978
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 "Who am I?"

979
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 The Pharisees are no longer

980
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 the recipients who have the ability

981
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 but do not need to be saved.

982
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 When Jesus Christ took them to think

983
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 from this perspective,

984
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 they were the people who fell into the hands of the rapists

985
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 and were half dead and could not save themselves.

986
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 This is a very powerful change in identity and perspective.

987
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 Because he broke the tradition

988
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 of the Pharisees' misconception.

989
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 Jesus Christ had to pull them out of self-doubt.

990
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 Why did he do that?

991
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 In the Gospel of Luke,

992
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 when Jesus Christ called on the Pharisees,

993
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 the Pharisees were the same person who wrote the Gospel of Matthew.

994
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 When he asked Matthew to follow him,

995
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 Matthew did not say a word and gave up everything and followed Jesus.

996
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 He even had a big feast at home

997
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 and invited many tax collectors and other people.

998
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 The Pharisees saw this and complained to Jesus Christ

999
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 why he was with tax collectors and sinners.

1000
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 These other people are considered sinners.

1001
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 He looked down on these people, although they were Jews.

1002
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 He looked down on them and regarded them as the rapists.

1003
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 Jesus answered,

1004
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 "Healthy people do not need doctors,

1005
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 sick people need them."

1006
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 This is actually a way of rebuking.

1007
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 It is not that these people are healthy and not sick.

1008
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 It is that they can't see themselves.

1009
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 They think they are selfish.

1010
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 They think they don't need other people's help,

1011
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 other people's grace, other people's compassion.

1012
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 They think they are okay.

1013
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 They don't need help.

1014
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 They don't need repentance.

1015
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 So Jesus answered,

1016
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 "Healthy people are these selfish people.

1017
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 They don't need doctors or God.

1018
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Sick people, these sinners,

1019
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 know that there is a sin,

1020
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 and the one who knows the sin is easy,

1021
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 knows that he is sick,

1022
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 and goes to God.

1023
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 Selfish people

1024
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 can't see the need and think they are healthy.

1025
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 So this healthy person is a repudiation.

1026
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 A person who repudiates them and despises them.

1027
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 And Jesus Christ came to make sinners repent.

1028
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 He didn't come to call the righteous.

1029
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 These people are not really righteous.

1030
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 They are selfish people.

1031
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 I am not here to call these selfish people.

1032
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 I am calling those who know the sin to repent.

1033
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 Jesus not only said it once here.

1034
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 He also said the same thing in the parable of the lost sheep.

1035
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 When I explained the parable of the lost sheep,

1036
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 the silver lost, and the return of the wolf,

1037
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 this parable of the three-placed one,

1038
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 I said that the 99 sheep were not enough.

1039
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 At that time, some people understood for the first time.

1040
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 Because he thought for many years,

1041
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 he thought the 99 sheep were fine.

1042
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 Actually, it was not enough.

1043
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 Why? Jesus also used a method of rebuke

1044
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 to describe them as "servants who do not need repentance."

1045
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 So the parable of the lost sheep is that

1046
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 when a lost sheep can be found,

1047
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 it is equivalent to a sinner repenting.

1048
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 Heaven will be happy for him.

1049
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 It is greater than the 99 servants who do not need repentance.

1050
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Those who do not need repentance and are selfish people

1051
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 will be happier.

1052
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 So the 99 sheep are not enough.

1053
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 The few who get enough are the minority.

1054
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 Although they are similar to those in the church,

1055
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 the minority get enough.

1056
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Because when a person is selfish,

1057
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 you can't see the sin, you won't admit it.

1058
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 Today, this is also what we need to be careful about in the church.

1059
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Because these scholars are people who read the Bible,

1060
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 people who have power in the church,

1061
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 people who directly participate in the church,

1062
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 but people who do not get enough,

1063
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 because they are self-defense.

1064
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 So Jesus Christ, in this question,

1065
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 from "who is my shepherd"

1066
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 to "who is the shepherd of what people?"

1067
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 "The one in the hands of the powerful."

1068
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 This person is half dead and cannot save himself.

1069
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 "The one in the hands of the powerful."

1070
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 He is no longer the sinner who does not need salvation.

1071
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 When this perspective changes,

1072
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Jesus Christ leads the Pharisees to leave the perspective of self-defense

1073
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 and turn to the perspective of "the one in the hands of the powerful."

1074
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 "The one in the hands of the powerful."

1075
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 This perspective changes and breaks the understanding of the Pharisees

1076
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 to the original of Aaron.

1077
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 Why?

1078
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 First, now he is the half-dead,

1079
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 the one who is deprived and cannot save himself.

1080
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 He can't pretend to be healthy and doesn't need a doctor.

1081
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 He can't pretend to be innocent and doesn't need salvation.

1082
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 He can no longer be a self-willed person who does not need salvation.

1083
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 This is the first break.

1084
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 The second break is that he used to be a fan of the Samaelites.

1085
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 But it turns out that even the enemies can be divided into sects.

1086
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 It turns out that the sects are not divided into sects and not divided into races.

1087
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 This is the second point to be broken for the view.

1088
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 Third, for those who bear eternal life,

1089
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 the salvation of God is not divided into sects and races.

1090
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 It is no longer limited to the Jews.

1091
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 The salvation is not only for the Jews,

1092
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 but also for all the people of the world,

1093
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 as Abraham blessed all the nations.

1094
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 The salvation of this savior is extremely generous.

1095
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 He does not calculate his own price,

1096
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 does not fear the danger,

1097
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 does not calculate his own price,

1098
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 but is generous and selfless.

1099
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 This is the Samaritan from the heart to the action,

1100
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 to carry out this covenant and request.

1101
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 When we look at the second level,

1102
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 we look at the lawmaker again.

1103
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 Now this victim is himself.

1104
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 He is a half-dead person who cannot be saved.

1105
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 On the contrary, his fellow travelers,

1106
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 his buddies,

1107
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
 none of them can follow the law.

1108
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 Both of them left when they saw it.

1109
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 This sentence let him know that the religion cannot help us follow the law.

1110
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 The religion cannot save us.

1111
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 On the contrary, the Samaritan he hates has moved his heart,

1112
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 to be immediately healed,

1113
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 arrange long-term care,

1114
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 even arrange a very generous plan to save and take care of them.

1115
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 So when we look at it from a different perspective,

1116
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 the answers to these questions are different.

1117
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 So we look at this passage again.

1118
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 We see that this Samaritan is from the heart

1119
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 to follow the law.

1120
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 The Samaritan is from the perspective of the victim,

1121
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 to understand the needs of the victim,

1122
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 then to follow the law.

1123
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 This is called loving the world and loving yourself.

1124
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 He starts from the perspective of the victim's needs,

1125
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 not self-doubting,

1126
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 giving what you need.

1127
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 He gives immediate help,

1128
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 long-term, unlimited help,

1129
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 immediate medical care.

1130
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 The Samaritan will continue to take care of this person

1131
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 and reward and help the owner.

1132
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 So after the second level,

1133
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 we look at the questions just now.

1134
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 Who am I?

1135
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 I am the Lord, I am the Lord.

1136
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 This is the law.

1137
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 This time his perspective is different.

1138
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 He needs to save the one.

1139
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 Because Jesus told him,

1140
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 you need to save that person from that perspective.

1141
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 He is now half dead and unable to save himself.

1142
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 He needs to rely on the connection and grace of the Savior.

1143
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 What are the people who are hurt?

1144
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 Those strongholds.

1145
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 Who are not concerned?

1146
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 His buddies, his friends,

1147
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 priests, hypocrites,

1148
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 these religious active participants.

1149
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 Their behavior and faith are incompatible.

1150
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 At the same time,

1151
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 all behaviors cannot be guarded.

1152
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 If all behaviors are not guarded,

1153
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 they will be saved.

1154
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 Unless he relies on the grace of God,

1155
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 the grace of God.

1156
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 Who is the guardian of the law?

1157
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 It is the enemy of the former heart, the Samaritan.

1158
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 Because this time from the perspective of the lawmaker,

1159
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 this is his enemy.

1160
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 But his enemy can guard the law,

1161
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 go from the heart to guard the law.

1162
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 And this Samaritan is this disciple.

1163
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 So if you look at the last sentence,

1164
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 you can do it as usual.

1165
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 It's almost the same as the first time.

1166
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 The only thing is that we have seen through it.

1167
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 The lawmaker also needs to be saved.

1168
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 Okay, if we take the whole story from the third level

1169
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 and expand it to other Bibles,

1170
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 we can see who is good.

1171
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 Samaritan.

1172
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 Because it mentions the heart of the Samaritan,

1173
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 or some Bibles also called the Samaritan's heart.

1174
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 This word is all out.

1175
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 New Testament, Old Testament.

1176
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 The New Testament talks about Jesus Christ.

1177
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 Jesus Christ saw those who were suffering from rheumatism,

1178
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 and the heart of the Samaritan.

1179
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 He touched them with his hands and healed them.

1180
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 Jesus Christ saw those blind people who could not see,

1181
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 and he touched their eyes with his hands.

1182
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 They immediately saw.

1183
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 If we look at the last three books,

1184
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 the last sentence is also about Jesus Christ.

1185
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 He touched the people who could not see,

1186
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 because they were in trouble.

1187
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
 Like sheep without a shepherd.

1188
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 Jesus Christ saw a large number of people,

1189
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 touched them with his hands and healed them.

1190
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 Jesus Christ called them to come.

1191
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 I touched the people with my hands and healed them.

1192
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 Because they had nothing to eat for three days.

1193
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 Jesus Christ said that the Lord touched the people with his hands

1194
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 and released them from their debts.

1195
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 So, who is the one who touched the people with his hands and healed them?

1196
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 The one who touched the people with his hands and healed them is the Samaritan,

1197
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 the one who released the dead from the body.

1198
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 This is our Savior Jesus Christ.

1199
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 If we look at the Old Testament,

1200
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 in the 103rd chapter of the Old Testament,

1201
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:23,000
 God is full of grace and does not show off his face.

1202
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 So, the Old Testament talks about the Father.

1203
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 Jesus Christ is the God who touched the body of the flesh

1204
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 and showed it to the people.

1205
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 So, if this Savior is the Samaritan,

1206
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 this Samaritan is Jesus Christ,

1207
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 then we can see that every sentence,

1208
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 there is a meaning in this parable.

1209
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 A spiritual meaning.

1210
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 For example, he used oil and wine

1211
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 to heal the sick.

1212
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 If we look at the picture of Jesus,

1213
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 the picture of the Ten Commandments,

1214
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
 when he was called to repent,

1215
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 he drove away many devils

1216
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 and used oil to heal the sick.

1217
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 So, oil and wine to heal the sick

1218
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
 represents healing.

1219
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Then he carried him up to the mountain

1220
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 and took care of him.

1221
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 What does "carrying" mean?

1222
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 In the Book of Acts,

1223
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 the God told the Israelites,

1224
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 "I will carry you when you are born.

1225
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
 I will support you.

1226
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 I will hold you.

1227
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 It represents salvation.

1228
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 So, the long-term care

1229
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 is to carry you up

1230
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 like a symbol of salvation.

1231
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
 The Bible says

1232
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 when the God of Egypt took them out of the wilderness

1233
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 and left the land,

1234
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 the God said,

1235
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 "Your God will carry you

1236
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 like carrying his own son."

1237
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 It means carrying you

1238
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 because I treat you as my son.

1239
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
 You have the fate of a son.

1240
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 You are chosen by God.

1241
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
 This is the will of God.

1242
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 Then, I will give you unlimited money.

1243
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 I will give you money to take care of the shopkeeper.

1244
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 I will give you other expenses.

1245
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 It means unlimited money.

1246
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 Then, I will grant you.

1247
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 So, in the Book of Acts,

1248
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
 Matthew and Luke,

1249
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
 the prophet will come back.

1250
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 Samaritan will come back to see us.

1251
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 So, after watching this story,

1252
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 if we look at it from a perspective of

1253
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 the repentance of sin,

1254
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 this Samaritan is our Savior Jesus Christ.

1255
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 He came to us from the flesh

1256
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 and knew that we were in the midst of sin.

1257
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 He moved the hearts of the people

1258
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 and used the wine of the right hand to support us,

1259
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
 to help us, to save us.

1260
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 He prepared a place for us

1261
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
 and will come back in the future.

1262
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 This is the whole story

1263
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 about the Savior Jesus Christ.

1264
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 Not only did he ask us to help people,

1265
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
 the most important thing is who this Samaritan is.

1266
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 The Savior Jesus Christ.

1267
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 Then, when we look at it again,

1268
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
 we ask the same question.

1269
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 If we go to the third level,

1270
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
 from a perspective of the repentance of sin,

1271
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
 to look at this Samaritan,

1272
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
 who am I?

1273
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
 I am the one who is half dead and in the hands of the robbers.

1274
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Why half dead?

1275
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
 I was spiritually dead.

1276
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 I was not dead physically,

1277
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
 so I was half dead.

1278
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 I was spiritually dead,

1279
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
 I was waiting to die physically.

1280
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 If I were dead physically,

1281
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 I would have been dead.

1282
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 I couldn't be saved.

1283
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
 But Jesus Christ connected us,

1284
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 came to save us.

1285
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
 The Holy Spirit,

1286
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
 with the Holy Spirit,

1287
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 purified our souls,

1288
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
 so we can wake up.

1289
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
 We are half dead.

1290
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 Spiritually, we are dead.

1291
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
 The Holy Spirit purified our souls.

1292
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
 We also violate other people's strength.

1293
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 Some doctrines say

1294
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 this strength is a devil.

1295
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 I disagree.

1296
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 We can't blame the devil.

1297
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 We can't blame the devil.

1298
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
 Like Adam,

1299
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 when he was in trouble,

1300
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 he blamed Eve,

1301
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 Eve blamed the snake.

1302
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 We commit a crime because of our selfishness.

1303
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 We can't be arrogant,

1304
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
 we can't be indifferent.

1305
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 We often violate others.

1306
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 We are also that strength.

1307
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 Sometimes we are the ones who care about others,

1308
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 the priests and the others.

1309
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 Who am I?

1310
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 I am one of these three types of people.

1311
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 We are all sinners.

1312
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 No matter how long we have been in the church,

1313
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 we remember that we are sinners without cause.

1314
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 We still have a sinning tendency.

1315
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
 We have to rely on God's grace to change every day.

1316
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 Who is the Lord Jesus Christ?

1317
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 The Lord Jesus Christ,

1318
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 who came to us from the city of sin

1319
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 and resuscitated us from the sin of the Sinian people,

1320
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
 the Lord Jesus Christ,

1321
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
 is the Lord Jesus Christ.

1322
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 So we love God and we love the Lord Jesus Christ.

1323
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 It's like a mirror.

1324
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
 When we understand how to love God and love the Lord Jesus Christ,

1325
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 we will be able to love the Lord Jesus Christ.

1326
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
 Who is the Lord Jesus Christ?

1327
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
 The Lord Jesus Christ, who moved the heart of the sinner.

1328
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
 So the whole story is about the Lord Jesus Christ,

1329
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 not just about the Lord Jesus Christ,

1330
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
 who helped those in need.

1331
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 The Lord Jesus Christ,

1332
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 who came to us from the city of sin and resuscitated us from the sin of the Sinian people,

1333
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
 moved the heart of the sinner,

1334
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 the Sinian people,

1335
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 and saved the sinners on the cross.

1336
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
 He made all the sinners perish,

1337
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 and the sinners be saved forever.

1338
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
 This is the most accurate example of the Samaritan.

1339
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 Why did I say that Jesus Christ is the one who followed the law?

1340
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
 Because only Jesus Christ followed the law.

1341
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
 He can follow the law.

1342
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 In the Matthew and the Book of Mormon,

1343
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
 Jesus said,

1344
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets.

1345
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
 I am not here to abolish,

1346
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 I am here to survive.

1347
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
 The law and the prophets are just old books.

1348
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
 There are three kinds of law in the Old Testament.

1349
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
 For example, the Ten Commandments are moral laws.

1350
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
 Only Jesus Christ can follow them.

1351
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
 None of us can follow them.

1352
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
 The law of the law of the law,

1353
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 that is, the law of the state,

1354
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 Jesus did not violate.

1355
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
 The most important thing is the law of the law.

1356
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
 The most important thing is to limit the lamb,

1357
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 not the sheep.

1358
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
 It is Jesus Christ.

1359
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 This innocent lamb,

1360
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 the former prophet,

1361
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 is a sheep,

1362
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 a sign of the Savior in the future.

1363
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
 This Savior is the innocent one,

1364
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 Jesus Christ, who died for the guilty.

1365
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 This perfect lamb,

1366
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 the lamb that died for the people,

1367
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
 the prophet,

1368
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 is Jesus Christ.

1369
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 So Jesus Christ came to survive.

1370
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
 In the Old Testament,

1371
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
 the lamb,

1372
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 the lamb of the prophet,

1373
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 the prophet that God appointed,

1374
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
 is Jesus Christ.

1375
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 He died for the guilty.

1376
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 This is the story.

1377
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
 So when we see the third level,

1378
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
 we can see that this is a metaphor for the guilt.

1379
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 So when we understand it,

1380
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
 we know that we live in sin.

1381
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
 We can't save ourselves.

1382
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 We can't take it for granted.

1383
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 Once we take it for granted,

1384
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 we can't see our sin.

1385
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
 The life of religion,

1386
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
 the knowledge of religion,

1387
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 the status of religion

1388
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 can't help us follow the Revolution.

1389
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 No one can be born again because of the Revolution.

1390
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
 We can't rely on our actions.

1391
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 We can't rely on our doings.

1392
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 But we humans

1393
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 actually treat our Savior as our enemy.

1394
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
 We nailed Jesus to the cross.

1395
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 People are saved

1396
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 because they need the union of the Savior.

1397
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
 We don't rely on our actions.

1398
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 We rely on our identity.

1399
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 And the only identity is to be God's children.

1400
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 But to be God's children

1401
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
 is not to rely on people's actions.

1402
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 It's all God's grace.

1403
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 It's God's grace.

1404
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
 God's union.

1405
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 We have no credit.

1406
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 And God's union.

1407
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 The subject of the personal grace point

1408
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 is not divided into nationality and race.

1409
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
 It includes our Savior.

1410
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 So when you like someone enough,

1411
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 don't be unhappy.

1412
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
 This is what God did in the Bible.

1413
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 It doesn't matter if I like it or not.

1414
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 On the contrary, God wants me to love my Savior.

1415
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 So we need to be able to

1416
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
 keep the first commandment.

1417
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
 First, we need to believe in Jesus Christ

1418
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 and know that we are sinners and repent.

1419
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 When you repent,

1420
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 you know you have sinned,

1421
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
 you will be grateful

1422
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 and you will have a response to God's love.

1423
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 God loves us first.

1424
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 We love God.

1425
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 Then we have the ability to love others.

1426
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 So how do you do it?

1427
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
 Who do you follow?

1428
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
 We follow the Savior.

1429
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
 This is Jesus Christ.

1430
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 Our Savior.

1431
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
 According to his life,

1432
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 his behavior,

1433
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
 his style,

1434
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 we follow Jesus and live according to Christ.

1435
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
 This is the meaning of following the way of worship.

1436
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 Not just to learn to help those in need.

1437
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 Those who need it.

1438
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 But the level is not the deepest.

1439
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
 The most important level is

1440
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
 to live in the style of the Savior.

1441
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 Why do we have to follow Jesus?

1442
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
 Because faith without behavior is dead.

1443
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 If our behavior is not consistent with repentance,

1444
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 it is fake.

1445
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 We are not really saved.

1446
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 Why do we have to follow Jesus?

1447
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Because the reason for God's love is to make us repent.

1448
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 And we have God's love.

1449
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 Jesus Christ is the glory of God.

1450
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 The truth of God's body.

1451
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 God is Jesus Christ.

1452
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
 Showing God's holiness to us.

1453
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
 To follow Christ,

1454
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 we have to write the Bible.

1455
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 Follow him in the cross.

1456
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
 I explained this in the previous video.

1457
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 I have to put myself as the center.

1458
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 Give up the "what".

1459
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
 "What" is the reason for my crime.

1460
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
 That thing is my sin when I am the center.

1461
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 I have to follow Jesus Christ as the center.

1462
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 Use him as an example to live our lives.

1463
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 Change our values.

1464
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 We prepare the cross at any time.

1465
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
 We have to follow him in this way.

1466
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 Finally, I want to explain.

1467
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 If we want to be saved by faith,

1468
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 why do we still have to follow God?

1469
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 Why do we have to love God?

1470
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
 Why do we have to love the Holy Spirit?

1471
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 In fact, the whole chapter of Luke 10,

1472
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
 it emphasizes the status, status,

1473
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 that is, the "being" is important,

1474
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
 not the behavior.

1475
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
 If we look at Luke 10,

1476
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
 Jesus sent 72 disciples to preach the gospel.

1477
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
 Then they came back very happy and told Jesus,

1478
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 "Lord, because of your name, even the devil has conquered us."

1479
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
 Jesus told them,

1480
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
 "Do not be happy because the devil has conquered you."

1481
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 Do not be so happy because of your behavior.

1482
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 "But rejoice in the record of your name in heaven."

1483
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 That is, your status is already in heaven.

1484
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
 This is important.

1485
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 So Jesus followed and praised God.

1486
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 The Holy Spirit made him happy.

1487
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 He said, "Father, the Lord of heaven and earth praises you,

1488
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 because you have hidden this matter from the wise and smart people."

1489
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
 The wise and smart people are like the philosophers,

1490
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
 they think they are smart.

1491
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
 So Jesus did not directly tell the truth.

1492
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
 Jesus told him something so that he knew,

1493
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
 indirectly knew that he could not do it.

1494
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
 He did not tell him directly.

1495
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
 He told him that he had to be reborn,

1496
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 to be reborn in water and spirit.

1497
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 But for some people who think they are smart,

1498
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
 sometimes Jesus did not give him a direct answer.

1499
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
 He indirectly showed him that he was not able to do it.

1500
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 He had to rely on God.

1501
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
 So here is the dialogue between the philosophers and Jesus.

1502
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
 We are talking about the metaphor today.

1503
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
 This scripture we see now is that

1504
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 to be eternal, to bear eternal life is a matter of status.

1505
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
 Only those who are God can be born.

1506
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 It is not up to you to be born.

1507
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 The last ten chapters are the story of Matthew and Mary.

1508
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 Matthew was worried about what he was doing.

1509
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
 Jesus said, "Mary has chosen the best part,

1510
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
 this part is the identity.

1511
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
 The part of God in God, no one can take it away.

1512
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
 So the whole 10 chapters of Matthew and Mary

1513
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
 emphasize the identity of status.

1514
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,000
 Heaven is more important than relying on action to enter heaven.

1515
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
 As a child of God,

1516
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 how to do this identity?

1517
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
 There have been many explanations.

1518
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 In the Gospel of John, it says, "The first of the ages is the coming of the coming of Jesus Christ,

1519
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
 who will come to our world, and will be with God.

1520
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
 He is God.

1521
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
 But those who accept him are those who accept Jesus Christ,

1522
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
 and those who believe in his name.

1523
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
 God is like these people,

1524
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 power and peace, and the offspring of God.

1525
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
 So to enter heaven and to bear eternal life,

1526
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
 you must have the status of the offspring of God.

1527
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
 How to have this status?

1528
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 Accept Jesus Christ as your Savior,

1529
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
 and believe in his name.

1530
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
 This power and peace as the offspring of God,

1531
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
 this power and peace is like us.

1532
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
 In the Book of Galatians, it is mentioned that

1533
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
 when the time comes,

1534
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
 God will cast out his offspring,

1535
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
 which is Jesus Christ.

1536
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 This offspring is born from a woman,

1537
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
 born under the law.

1538
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
 He wants to save people out of the law,

1539
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
 to protect us from the name of the son,

1540
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
 which is Jesus Christ.

1541
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
 He wants to save us, so we can have the status of the offspring of God.

1542
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
 God will cast out the offspring of God,

1543
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
 which is the Holy Spirit entering our hearts.

1544
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
 In this case, we can rely on God's offspring

1545
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
 to bear the fruit of the womb,

1546
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
 and to bear eternal life.

1547
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
 This is God's grace, not our own.

1548
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
 So Jesus Christ emphasized in his "Prayer to the Gate of the Covenant"

1549
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
 that God is like eternal life.

1550
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
 This "like" is not what we have earned,

1551
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
 but what God has given us.

1552
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
 The purpose of God's grace is to make us repent.

1553
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
 So here, the second chapter of the Book of Galatians

1554
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
 says that God's grace is to make us repent.

1555
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
 And when people repent,

1556
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
 it means that they know their sins,

1557
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
 they know God's forgiveness.

1558
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
 When we know that we have committed many sins,

1559
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 God has forgiven us,

1560
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
 we will love God more.

1561
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
 In the conversation between Simon and Jesus,

1562
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
 Jesus led Simon to answer,

1563
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
 "I want to be merciful."

1564
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
 That is, people who have many sins and are merciful

1565
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
 will have a greater response to God's love.

1566
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,000
 To bear eternal life,

1567
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
 we have to rely on the Holy Spirit to cause death to our bodies.

1568
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 The Holy Spirit leads us.

1569
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
 We are not completely

1570
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
 by the grace of God.

1571
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
 But after we are saved,

1572
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
 we rely on God, on the Holy Spirit

1573
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
 to help us to cause death to our bodies.

1574
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
 In our holy mind,

1575
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
 we walk from sin to righteousness

1576
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
 until we see the Lord.

1577
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
 And when we are willing to walk this path,

1578
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
 we are actually the children of God.

1579
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
 Only the children of God have the Holy Spirit to guide us,

1580
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
 to help us walk from sin to righteousness.

1581
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
 So why do we have to follow the Covenant?

1582
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
 The Covenant is not given to those who have not been saved.

1583
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
 If we look at the Old Testament,

1584
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
 God first saved the Israelites with Moses,

1585
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
 and then issued the law.

1586
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
 It was not given to the law to save them,

1587
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
 the law was first saved,

1588
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
 but God saved the Israelites,

1589
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
 and then issued the law to them.

1590
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
 So people cannot rely on the law to be saved.

1591
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
 Why do this?

1592
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
 Because the law is given to those who have been saved.

1593
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
 How to guard?

1594
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
 It is to be transformed by the Holy Spirit,

1595
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
 so that we can follow the law of God.

1596
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
 So why do we have to follow the law?

1597
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
 Not because the law can save us,

1598
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
 but the law helps us to learn

1599
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
 the Holy Spirit, justice and good.

1600
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
 Why? The Old Testament is very clear.

1601
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
 In the 7th chapter of the Old Testament,

1602
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
 it is mentioned in the 12th chapter,

1603
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
 "The law of God is the Holy Spirit,

1604
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 and the Covenant is the Holy Spirit, justice and good."

1605
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
 So when God first saved the Israelites,

1606
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 after the Israelites were saved,

1607
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
 the law helped them to learn

1608
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
 what is the Holy Spirit, justice and good.

1609
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
 We are the same.

1610
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
 The law of God is not the way to be saved.

1611
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 The way to be saved is to follow the law.

1612
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
 And when we follow the law,

1613
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
 God gives us the Holy Spirit,

1614
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
 so that we can love others.

1615
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
 Why? Because in Matthew,

1616
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
 there is a passage that is easy to be misunderstood.

1617
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
 In the 7th chapter of the Book of Mormon,

1618
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
 "You pray, and I will open the door for you.

1619
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
 You seek, and I will build. You beg, and I will open the door for you."

1620
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
 Many people see this sentence and say,

1621
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
 "I have a long list of things I want,

1622
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
 but I have to ask God for this and that."

1623
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
 But actually, this passage is not like that.

1624
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
 It is not like we want to ask God for what we want.

1625
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
 What is it about?

1626
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
 In the 11th chapter,

1627
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
 "Although you are evil,"

1628
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
 we should pay attention to this sentence.

1629
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
 Jesus Christ told the believers,

1630
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
 "Although you are evil,

1631
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
 but you know that the good things will come to you.

1632
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 And the Father in heaven will not

1633
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
 give the good things to the people who seek Him."

1634
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
 What is this good thing?

1635
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
 In the Book of Mormon,

1636
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
 it explains that this good thing is

1637
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
 "the spirit of God will not be able to reach those who seek Him."

1638
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
 We pray,

1639
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
 not for a list of things we want to ask God for.

1640
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
 We pray for the spirit to enter our hearts

1641
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
 and help us to die for our sins.

1642
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
 So that we can...

1643
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
 So, how do you want to treat people?

1644
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
 How do you want people to treat you?

1645
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
 How do you want to treat people?

1646
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
 Love people as yourself.

1647
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
 That is, we pray,

1648
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
 ask God for the spirit to fill us.

1649
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
 Pray for us to love others as we love ourselves.

1650
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
 Love others as we love ourselves.

1651
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
 This is the general meaning of the law and the prophet.

1652
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
 So here, this "give, give, give, give, give"

1653
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
 is for others, not for ourselves.

1654
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
 We pray for the spirit,

1655
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
 pray for God to give us the spirit to fill us.

1656
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
 Pray for us to obey God's teaching

1657
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
 to love others as we love ourselves.

1658
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
 That's what it means.

1659
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
 But this door is narrow.

1660
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
 So, finally, I will use the example of the eight books.

1661
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
 The eight books are eight kinds of qualities,

1662
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
 not the conditions of salvation.

1663
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
 These eight books have been reborn,

1664
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
 have been reborn by the Holy Spirit,

1665
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
 the qualities of the salvation of the Christian.

1666
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 They are from seeing their own sins,

1667
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
 knowing that their souls are in need of God,

1668
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
 and feeling sorrow for their sins.

1669
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
 Then, because we have nothing,

1670
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
 everything is dependent on God's grace,

1671
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
 we become gentle,

1672
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
 not to compete with others.

1673
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 We are unselfish,

1674
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
 love God's work,

1675
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
 we love God.

1676
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
 Then, because we have the grace of God,

1677
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
 we also have the grace of others.

1678
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
 We love others.

1679
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
 We don't calculate.

1680
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
 We are unselfish.

1681
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
 We live with people and God.

1682
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
 We don't calculate ourselves.

1683
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:08,000
 Like this priest and this Limei person,

1684
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
 they calculate their own safety,

1685
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
 their own benefits.

1686
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
 They believe in God and don't consider their own benefits.

1687
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
 They are peaceful,

1688
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
 love others, including their enemies.

1689
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
 In the end, they are even forced to do evil.

1690
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
 So, it is a life of turning to righteousness.

1691
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
 From believing in repentance,

1692
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
 to changing our mind,

1693
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
 to changing our behavior,

1694
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
 this is a way of life,

1695
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
 to learn the way of Christianity.

1696
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
 I will use this picture to explain

1697
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
 the difference between "grace, faith, and righteousness" and "guarding the cross".

1698
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
 Before we were saved,

1699
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
 I drew two roads here.

1700
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
 This is a narrow road,

1701
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
 this is a wide road.

1702
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
 Before we enter the narrow road of heaven,

1703
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
 we cannot rely on our behavior.

1704
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
 We enter heaven to believe in the grace of Jesus Christ,

1705
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
 to save us from our sins,

1706
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
 to be moved by the Holy Spirit.

1707
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
 So, we pray for the Holy Spirit to move us,

1708
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
 to let us know our sins,

1709
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
 to accept our sins,

1710
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
 to understand God's love for us.

1711
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
 Then we can have a response,

1712
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
 repentance,

1713
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
 life change, behavior change,

1714
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
 and accept Jesus Christ as our Savior.

1715
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
 Because God loves us first,

1716
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
 we are forgiven,

1717
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
 we can love God,

1718
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
 and have a response to God.

1719
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
 God loves us first,

1720
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
 we can love God,

1721
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
 and love people.

1722
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
 We need the Holy Spirit to revive our sins,

1723
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
 so that we can follow the way of Christ.

1724
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
 Before entering this road,

1725
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
 we need to clear this step,

1726
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
 we cannot rely on our behavior,

1727
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
 it is completely God's grace,

1728
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
 it is the work of the Holy Spirit.

1729
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
 After entering this road,

1730
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
 this road is eternal,

1731
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
 we walk to the end of our lives,

1732
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
 this holy road.

1733
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
 So we are not done yet.

1734
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
 We have cleared the path,

1735
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
 no longer under the law.

1736
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
 So we have to follow the law,

1737
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
 we have to work hard to walk this path.

1738
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
 Work hard not by our own ability,

1739
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
 work hard is to follow the Holy Spirit,

1740
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
 to die for the evil of the body.

1741
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
 We must live,

1742
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
 because the spirit of the devil is actually the work of God.

1743
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
 So when we enter this path,

1744
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
 we will make mistakes,

1745
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
 we will turn from sin to righteousness.

1746
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
 In this process,

1747
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
 in this path of holiness,

1748
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
 in this growth,

1749
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
 we are not perfect.

1750
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
 We cannot rely on the law,

1751
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
 but we have to follow the law,

1752
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
 because the law helps us to learn

1753
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
 the righteousness of the Holy Spirit.

1754
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
 We are no longer under the law,

1755
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
 even if I make a mistake,

1756
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
 I will not be judged by the law,

1757
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
 because I am under the grace of God,

1758
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
 Jesus Christ has paid the price for my sin.

1759
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
 In this process,

1760
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
 we continue to change our thoughts and ideas,

1761
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
 from sin to righteousness,

1762
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
 live in the way of Christ,

1763
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
 change our behavior and life,

1764
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
 and walk out of our faith and life

1765
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
 in harmony with one another.

1766
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
 Then we can love God,

1767
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
 love the Holy Spirit.

1768
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
 We are not perfect,

1769
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
 but with the help of the Holy Spirit,

1770
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
 we will gradually die for our sins,

1771
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
 from sin to righteousness,

1772
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
 walk this path until we see God.

1773
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
 This is the path of salvation for the sheep,

1774
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
 the sheep of the sheep.

1775
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
 The most dangerous is this path of sheep.

1776
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
 This path of sheep is also uncertain,

1777
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
 but it is very close to this narrow road.

1778
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
 These sheep think they are with the sheep,

1779
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
 they are also saved.

1780
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
 But on the day of judgment,

1781
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
 they suddenly wake up,

1782
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
 they are not saved,

1783
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
 because they do not repent of their sins,

1784
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
 repentance includes changing thoughts and ideas,

1785
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
 life is a way of change,

1786
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
 that is repentance.

1787
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
 Today, many people, even those in the church,

1788
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
 we know our sins, but we do not repent.

1789
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
 We live in the same church,

1790
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
 it is very possible that we are walking on a path of life,

1791
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
 so everyone must be careful,

1792
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
 reflect on yourself.

1793
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
 Finally, I want to explain,

1794
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
 this sentence is said by the Bible,

1795
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
 "The Lord who loves you wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly,

1796
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
 and loves himself and the disciples."

1797
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
 Why do we have to do so many things?

1798
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
 There is a reason.

1799
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
 Because when Jesus Christ corrected the Jews

1800
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
 about the concept of loving the disciples,

1801
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
 he told us,

1802
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
 "You not only love the disciples you love,

1803
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
 but also worship your enemies and pray for them.

1804
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
 If you do not do this,

1805
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
 you are still just tax collectors and patriots,

1806
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
 you are not the children of God.

1807
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
 Because God is complete, you have to learn from him.

1808
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
 Learning from him does not mean you are complete.

1809
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
 We are on this holy path,

1810
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
 we have to learn from him.

1811
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
 That is, we cannot stay in sin,

1812
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
 we should always stay in the Lord's love.

1813
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
 Even if we are still in sin,

1814
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
 we should be determined.

1815
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
 We should respect God,

1816
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
 love God, and start to live in the name of God,

1817
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
 to change our lives,

1818
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
 to die for our sins,

1819
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
 to walk that path.

1820
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
 But we have to learn to follow the law,

1821
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
 to learn to learn the love of the Holy Spirit.

1822
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
 Because the Lord we will meet in the future

1823
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
 is the Lord of the love of the Holy Spirit.

1824
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
 We have to learn how to learn the love of the Holy Spirit.

1825
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
 Because he has already given us the law,

1826
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
 taught us to walk this path.

1827
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
 So you do it like a talent.

1828
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
 The talent is to follow Jesus Christ.

1829
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
 So we follow Jesus Christ,

1830
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
 live in Christ.

1831
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
 So loving the disciples is not a condition to enter heaven.

1832
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
 It is a life performance of a blind man who has been reborn.

1833
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,000
 Why do we have to be wholehearted,

1834
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
 wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly?

1835
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
 Because we are enemies.

1836
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
 We cannot rely on our feelings.

1837
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
 I don't want to.

1838
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
 I don't want to.

1839
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
 But God teaches us to support with will.

1840
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
 When I don't want to,

1841
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
 we know God calls us to love our enemies.

1842
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
 Because we love God.

1843
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
 My will tells me to do my best.

1844
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
 I will do it with my life.

1845
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
 So why do we have to be wholehearted, wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly?

1846
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
 Will is the will.

1847
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
 When I don't want to, my will tells me to do my best.

1848
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
 I will do my best.

1849
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
 The same sentence is said in the Gospel of Luke.

1850
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
 When Jesus Christ explains how we should love our enemies,

1851
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
 he says, "If you love only those who love you,

1852
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
 what good is it?

1853
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
 Sinners love those who love them."

1854
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
 Sinners will do the same.

1855
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
 If we only love our enemies,

1856
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
 we are no different from sinners.

1857
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
 Our identity is also a sinner,

1858
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
 we are also a patriot.

1859
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
 And for those who have been reborn,

1860
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
 we have to pray to God to help us to love our enemies.

1861
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
 If we are not wholehearted, we have to be wholehearted

1862
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
 to love our enemies.

1863
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
 This is very difficult.

1864
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
 We have to love, not to hate.

1865
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
 So why do we have to be wholehearted to help us to love our enemies?

1866
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
 Because my heart is not necessarily,

1867
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
 but my will tells me to be wholehearted.

1868
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
 Our heart has to love.

1869
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
 Because when we are willing,

1870
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
 we are the will of the Savior.

1871
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:23,000
 So he said, "For God has his own good and evil,

1872
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
 you have to be like him,

1873
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
 follow Christ,

1874
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
 follow Christ,

1875
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
 follow Christ,

1876
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
 love God, love the Holy Spirit, love your enemies."

1877
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
 I will share with you today.

1878
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
 If you have any questions,

1879
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
 because there is no time for answering this time,

1880
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:51,000
 I would like to invite you to comment below my YouTube channel.

1881
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
 I will answer your questions as much as possible.

1882
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
 Thank you very much.

1883
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
 God bless you.

1884
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
 OK, bye-bye.

1885
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:21,000
