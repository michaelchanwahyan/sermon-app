1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(字幕君:我地係咁嘅)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
好啦,咁頭先呢可以咁講呢就係呢

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
大家如果見個人畫呢D嘅素描呢

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
好多時候呢真係

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
咁樣畫十筆八筆呢

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
畫到輪廓先

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
咁跟住再呢度又畫頭髮啦

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
其實頭先楊希臘未知我未講完㗎其實呢

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我頭先只係畫咗個輪廓㗎啫

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
咁我叫特別係杜峰山多個同工呢

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
幫我手打咗多quotation

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
大家見到咁多版呢我自己打唔切㗎

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
佢打同埋呢

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
佢插出嚟

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
咁我再整你個

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
咁所以我都會

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
其實頭先都七張個密落都講咗

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
咁咁因為時間唔夠呢

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
第七張基本上唔講㗎啦

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
就主要由第一張講到第六張

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
即係都係要跳好多

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
咁呢就而家再睇返少少一啲嘅

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
即係一啲嘅再highlight返每一張

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
一啲quotation

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
特別有啲精彩嘅

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
咁同大家講一講下

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
頭先講過啦

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
講到卡尼嗰度呢

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
佢已經講到呢一個

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
嗰個嘅限制啦

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
就話其實佢將呢個

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
即係個張主觀同客觀細嘅分得睇開呢

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
就帶嚟一種嘅Jewelous 甚至係二元盾

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
我睇第二版

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
另外一個佢就都

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hans Klung 指出咗話呢

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
即係其實數學

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
好多時候呢

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Decalci 就用數學嘅模式

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
佢認為一切呢

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
係源於一啲叫做

42
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Clear and distinct ideas

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
呢啲呢好明確清晰嘅概念

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
就係好似數學啲公理咁樣㗎

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
咁但係當時佢以為數學公理

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
大家都有共識冇懷疑嘅

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
咁但係去到後期呢

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
開發到原來係幾學裏面呢

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
一個所謂Euclidean Geometry 同埋

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Non-Euclidean Geometry 呢

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
大家可以透過兩種唔同嘅公理

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
兩個都可以成立嘅

53
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
但可以開展出兩套

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
完全唔同嘅數學系統出嚟

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
咁開始就質疑就究竟數學

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
如果都有分歧

57
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
咁係數學根基

58
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
係咪就能夠擴立呢

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
理性如果數學上面都冇Certainty

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
點能喺其他上面有Certainty呢

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
咁樣

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
跟住第二個Cultation 再後面都講到呢

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
所以絕對懷疑係唔可能嘅

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
好多時候呢好多人成日解釋

65
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
咩都可以懷疑

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
咁但係其實好多人再睇返

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hans Kroon 個個

68
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hans Kroon 再睇返呢

69
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
卡爾個個過程當中

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
其實佢懷疑都

71
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
很多人就指出

72
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
佢懷疑都用到語言啦

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
你用到語言

74
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
咁唔通你

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
你都知道你語言有個意義呀

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
你唔能夠假設話你乜都唔信

77
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
即係佢話咗乜都懷疑到

78
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
懷疑唔到

79
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
但其實係個個當中

80
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
其實佢已經假設咗好多嘅嘢

81
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
所以每個人都係一個Framework 裏面

82
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
其實呢你係好難話抽離絕對嘅懷疑

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
咁所以好多時候

84
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
這種對宗教批判

85
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
好多時候都有一種好虛假

86
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
一種好普遍理性呀

87
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
咩都能夠懷疑呀

88
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
咁點解你唔懷疑宗教

89
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
咁但其實當我哋用

90
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
用返鄭嘉儀嗰個個例子去睇返

91
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
好多人都指出呢

92
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
其實呢就係你根本懷疑係唔可能

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
即係絕對懷疑係唔可能

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
咁但先講一個文化嘅問題啦

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
所以去到後現代

96
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
有啲人都甚至講呢

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
你相信文化你都仍然相信上帝

98
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
所以呢要絕對否定

99
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
即係即係上帝否定所謂呢

100
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
呢個叫Antophiology

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
大家知道我講邊個

102
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
呢個德里達

103
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
佢連文化都要質疑埋

104
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
質疑埋文化有冇一個呢

105
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
真係客觀嘅規則

106
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
因為只不過係一個無窮嘅

107
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A 指稱B

108
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
G B 再指稱C

109
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
即係只係一個嘅

110
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
即係呢個嘅能指

111
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
所謂Signifier

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
一個無窮嘅圈裏面

113
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
係度走唔出去嘅呢根本

114
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
所以好多呢啲要點呢

115
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
都係同後現代先生有個關係

116
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
咁所以佢係嗰度

117
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
第107頁嗰度

118
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
老實講啦

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
佢就係喺所有度

120
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
佢就用奧古斯丁同帕斯基去糾正佢啦

121
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
佢話呢唔僅係基督信

122
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
解釋嘅問題上面呢

123
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
同埋日常問題上面信仰都係必須嘅

124
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
正如信仰需要理性一樣理性

125
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
需要信仰

126
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
所以呢

127
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hansung其中一個project呢

128
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
佢去去

129
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
可以話係去殿滅科學

130
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
理性嗰種嘅絕對性

131
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
所以佢又講出你都頭先都提過

132
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
帕斯基嗰啲我已經提過

133
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
唔多講啦

134
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
睇一睇就再下一段有度寫咗個題目叫做

135
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
科學方法論嘅反思

136
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
呢個就好大好多人

137
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
理性唔係喺科學裏面好清晰

138
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
即係表明咗咩

139
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
咁所以Hansung喺嗰度呢就

140
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
從呢個即係

141
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
現代一種嘅

142
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
邏輯實質論開始講起

143
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
實際上好多問題其中一個呢就係

144
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
係科學裏面

145
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Karl Popper呢就指出到其實

146
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
根本科學理論本身

147
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
都有啲無限嘅

148
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
含意嘅譬如就算好簡單

149
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
其實就唔得係咁樣啦即係譬如話

150
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Karl Popper講好多嘢嘅其中

151
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
佢講出就話其實所有觀察

152
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
都有理論嘅

153
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
我問大家見到啲乜嘢

154
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
呢張裏面係乜嘢

155
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
水你真係肯定

156
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
其中一個你話

157
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
水

158
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
代表咩水係一種substance

159
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
同埋你會預期呢你話水嘅時候呢

160
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
佢係飲得嘅

161
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
冇味嘅

162
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
但係我試過細個就打開雪櫃

163
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
攞瓶水一飲發現係煎酒嚟嘅

164
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
飲到我即係

165
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
錯洗後咁呢其實係我哋一觀察

166
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
我哋一make observation我話你話水

167
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
或者玻璃或者塑膠樽

168
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
或者人其實呢你都

169
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
有好多個假設譬如你假設我係背脊嘅

170
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
可能你拎過嚟真係冇背脊嘅

171
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
你見到有啦可能冇㗎喎

172
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
你唔知㗎喎

173
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
講真嚟講你見到前面但你話呢個人

174
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
但可能呢個只係人板

175
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
得半個人嘅板

176
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
大家唔好覺得好似唔可能

177
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
我試過去個

178
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
博物館睇著杯

179
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
咁睇完之後杯有咩好睇呢

180
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
個個博物館就話叫你

181
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
撳下掣咁個杯呢就

182
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
轉過嚟咦得半隻

183
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
嘅啫佢後面唔係圓嘅

184
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
係平嘅其實係

185
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
一個半圓形嘅

186
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
橫線面嚟嘅

187
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
你突然間好shock

188
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
因為我一睇我地就預期個杯係圓嘅

189
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
點知原來係一個半圓形咁樣嘅

190
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
後面我係三藩市見到咁嘅杯

191
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
我就特登買返嚟下一次

192
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
做個示範畀大家睇一睇

193
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
咁其實呢Columbus指出所有嘅觀察呢

194
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
其實都已經係 theory-laden

195
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
所以呢樣嘢其實Pupper已經指出到

196
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
跟住佢認為呢其實科學理論

197
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
好難去證實因為

198
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
你話

199
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
你話我引力咁樣佢就指出到所有地方

200
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
所有時空都係

201
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
適合但係你有限嘅觀察呢

202
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
你證明唔到無限

203
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
咁所以佢認為科學只能夠

204
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
正義所謂 falsify 只能夠

205
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
所謂正義主義

206
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
咁你所謂如果正義唔到嘅理論

207
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
我應該

208
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
正義到嘅理論就應該拋棄

209
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
只能夠接受嗰啲呢經過正義嘅考驗

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
又呢

211
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
係勝過嘅咁樣

212
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
喺呢度呢

213
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
但係即係喺後期發展呢

214
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hans Kuhn 又指出

215
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
但好不幸呢呢個理論

216
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
摧毀咗呢個邏輯實證論

217
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
但係佢本身亦都被正義

218
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
佢認為咁佢就係根據呢個 Thomas Kuhn

219
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
一個另外一個嘅

220
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
科學思想家因為 Thomas Kuhn 就指出

221
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
其實喺科學實際面裏面呢

222
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
都唔係正義咁簡單嘅

223
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
佢認為

224
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Harlberg 認為呢正義

225
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
正義咗就應該拋棄啦

226
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
咁但係 Thomas Kuhn 就指出其實所有理論

227
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
都會有反例嘅好多時

228
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
將個反例只係 ignore

229
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
或者係唔

230
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
就擺埋一邊唔去理會

231
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
咁所以你就當冇問題發生

232
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
咁所以其實就喺科學史裏面呢

233
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
其實都唔係

234
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
按照 Kuhn 嘅理論所以呢

235
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
佢認為呢按照佢後面其實都

236
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
引用好多 Thomas Kuhn 嘅理論呢

237
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
所謂有一個所謂典範或者範式

238
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
個概念 即每個科學家其實都

239
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
喺做科學之前都有一套典範

240
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
呢個 paradigm

241
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
你喺個 paradigm 當中去

242
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
填洞 去搵呢個結果

243
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
但係你好少係激烈

244
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
嘅挑戰個 paradigm 本身

245
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
咁所以佢用返呢個呢後面寫一本呢

246
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
講係用 paradigm 嗰度去分析神樂史

247
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
所以佢後面都講咗一句 178 頁嗰度

248
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
大家睇下呢時呢數目字見到

249
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
你就搵返個 quotation 啦

250
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
佢就話呢其實神學同自然科學呢個平衡性呢

251
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
係好吃驚嘅

252
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
所以我見到其實頭一張

253
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
都好重要因為呢個呢就係一個

254
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
groundwork 嚟嘅 我哋要明白呢

255
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
其實佢係想對一個理性主義有一個

256
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
好強嘅批判 如果你唔明白呢個

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
你就唔能夠 grab 數嘅後期呢

258
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
即係嗰種嘅要經過

259
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
決擇去肯定實在肯定上帝

260
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
然後跳到基督教嗰度呢 你就好難去

261
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
把握㗎喇 咁所以總結

262
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
嚟到講呢 佢就所講

263
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
一種呢就話呢喺第 191 頁

264
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
就講到一種將理性同

265
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
即係人生嘅思考結合嘅一個 approach

266
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
就先講過唔再多講啦

267
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
好啦我哋跳到去第二第三版

268
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
第三版頭先講

269
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Chapter 2 就講上帝嘅概念

270
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
我哋就解釋少少 頭先都聽提過

271
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Thomas Hansen

272
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
想批評

273
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
係咩概念呢

274
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
佢主要想批評就係兩種嘅概念

275
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
一種呢 我哋叫做古典嘅

276
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
有神論 Classical Vision 呢個古典呢

277
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
主要係指西方嘅古典

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
因為按照西方嘅有神論

279
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
最重要嗰個嘅

280
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
嘅詮釋者呢就當然係多瑪斯阿奎那

281
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thomas Aquinas

282
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
當有呢個多瑪斯阿奎那呢

283
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
呢一個嘅神呢係一個呢

284
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
無法分辨 無法分辨

285
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
係一個即係係一個

286
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
即係 impossible

287
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
係不受影響 係不受影響 亦都無情緒嘅

288
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
變咗係一個無感情

289
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
即係無我哋嗰啲

290
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
即係起路哀樂呀 嗰啲起伏嘅感情

291
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
一個呢係咁樣終極嘅上帝

292
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
嚟嘅 咁但係呢

293
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
佢就 Thomas Hansen

294
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
就覺得呢個上帝就過份超越

295
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
過份超越呢

296
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
佢都好似同個世界好遙遠

297
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
咁樣 咁所以都呢係

298
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
唔能夠fit到現代嘅精神

299
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
咁當然佢就透過好多嘅

300
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
同人體Hagle呀

301
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
嗰啲威脅嗰啲Dialogs去帶出嚟

302
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
咁第二種上帝呢就係

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Morphic God

304
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
所謂神人同形論 咁即係我將上帝

305
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
將個人呢 好像放大咗

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
即係好似呢放大咗一個老爺爺

307
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
不過好powerful老爺爺

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
咁呢就係有權有勢有能力

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
但係亦都同人一樣呢

310
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
會嬲呀 會跳跳蚱呀

311
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
會偏愛一個呀

312
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
會鍾意一個呀

313
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
好似有好似人類好多嘅

314
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
特性呀 情緒咁樣

315
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
佢認為呢個就將神好似都拉同人拉得太緊

316
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
太近

317
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
太過呢係二人化

318
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
佢認為呢個係好粗略嘅

319
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
好似王大先式嘅一種宗教

320
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
所以呢佢認為呢係要係一個嘅

321
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
嘅當中

322
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
一個平衡 呢方面呢現代嘅

323
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
呢個神官呢唔可以好似以前嗰個神呢

324
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
好似高高在上

325
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
唔受人間嘅影響 佢話真正有愛嘅神

326
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
點能夠唔受人類歷史所發生嘅事影響呢

327
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
佢一定係有感受會回應

328
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
呢個都係呢

329
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
但係佢就冇去到

330
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Mormon嘅The Crucified God

331
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
嗰度咁徹底

332
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
但係佢都指出呢佢都係環返個方向入面呢

333
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
找一個係有感受有參與歷史嘅上帝

334
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
亦都呢 但係佢都覺得唔係將將上帝

335
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
佢比同人完全一樣

336
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
佢有慧格 但係呢係超過人嘅慧格

337
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
呢一點呢

338
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
特別係第七章呢度呢 同其他宗教對話嘅時候呢

339
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
亦都再重新提返出嚟

340
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
所以關於上帝概念嗰度呢

341
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
大家要夾住第二章同第七章呢

342
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
上卷下卷呢

343
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
呢兩度參照睇就更加明白啦

344
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
好啦 第三點呢就去講到呢一個嘅

345
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
無神黨嘅挑戰啦

346
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
費爾不克 頭先我其實都講到唔少

347
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
所以就唔再唔再多講啦

348
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
因為後面時間都唔係好夠呀

349
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
咁我只想補充一點呢就係好多時候呢

350
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
無神黨嘅批評都係

351
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
用用返佢哋無神黨自己本身嘅

352
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
呢個都係一個招數啦

353
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
都係一個招數啦可以成日用嘅

354
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
因為好多時候呢 即係佢哋成日話

355
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
你幾多個投射呢樣樣

356
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
咁但我諗返

357
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
咁費爾巴其實去到最後你認為呢

358
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
佢亦都提出好得意嘅概念

359
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
佢認為人係一個所謂specious being

360
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
因為其實佢話人係將無

361
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
人 你話上帝係人去投射

362
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
投射自己出去

363
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
但係點解去投射無限呢

364
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
人嘅理性愛都係有限㗎嘛

365
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
如果你係將人去投射上帝呢

366
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
你就應該得到啲咩上帝呢

367
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
就好似啲Olympic Gods嘅

368
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
即係嗰時希臘神話裏面

369
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
呢個奧林巴克山上面嘅上帝呢

370
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
得閒就增風合措呀

371
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
得閒就溝女呀 得閒就生個先生子呀

372
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
得閒就將人撕咗兩邊呀

373
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
咁樣呢 好多你睇下神話

374
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
好多呢你古靈精怪呢

375
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
係同人類嗰啲咁嘅 即係做嘅事情一模一樣嘅

376
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
咁嗰啲你話真係好似人嘅投射啦

377
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
咁人嘅行為投射去天上面

378
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
將嗰個翻版其實都好似呢

379
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
好似中國嗰啲玉皇大帝咁樣

380
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
道家玉皇大帝嗰啲發覺其實係人嘅放大嚟嘅啫

381
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
嗰度一樣大家又偷盤圖呀

382
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
呢個玉皇大帝又帶返嚟去停呀

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
跟住就發咗嗰個落下凡呀

384
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
咁呢個嗰個咁樣

385
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
好人間嘅

386
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
不過你又將呢個人間嘅停變上天停

387
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
嗱咁但係呢

388
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
就算你睇下Qualis嗰個神就先講過

389
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Gilgason有時其實唔係咁人意人化嘅喎

390
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
人神係咁無限嘅性咁樣

391
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
咁所以其實係呢個原因當中呢

392
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
科爾伯呢就要提出一個所謂嘅

393
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
人呢其實係過濾咗將佢自己嘅

394
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
即係嘅

395
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
呢啲唔完美嘅屬性係過濾咗

396
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
投射一個整體性

397
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
無一個有一個人整個類嚟講呢

398
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
佢話人有一種基本嘅特性呢

399
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
就係理性愛

400
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
等等然後投射上帝一度

401
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
咁但係科爾伯就

402
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
就咁寒鬆地問返喇你哋

403
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
第三版最後嗰度啦

404
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
但係我哋實際上經驗見到人都係有限嘅人

405
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
你提出呢個概念

406
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
會唔會本身你係不理解呢

407
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
提出呢個概念會唔會本身你係

408
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
project你自己嘅價值觀

409
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
喺人上面呢

410
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
咁所以其實你所講嘅投射論都係

411
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
解釋你自己嗰套嘢係咪

412
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
其實到最後呢你發佈神論到

413
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
到最後當佢放棄咗上帝嘅

414
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
信念好多時候佢只係

415
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
搵第二啲嘢去塑造一個終極

416
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
我去睇第四版

417
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
咁你就睇個總結嗰度因為呢

418
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
除咗科爾伯去睇

419
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Marks、Froy都好精彩

420
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
咁我唔夠詳細講啦

421
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
咁所以你見到佢總結都好講到其實呢

422
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
弗洛伊德佢就話

423
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
我唔相信上帝但後面佢話我相信科學

424
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
佢認為呢你可能話我都係一種嘅

425
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
一種嘅illusion

426
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
但佢認為除咗呢個之外都無其他

427
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
可以取代科學

428
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
咁但係經過咗百幾年再進一步發展

429
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
我都知道呢單靠科學

430
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
事實上真係解決唔到社會

431
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
倫理嘅問題或者甚至人類嘅未來

432
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
亦都係受到威嚇

433
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
亦都可能呢

434
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
佢認為呢個都係將佢當時嘅

435
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
時代嘅精神投射

436
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
咁Marks其實就將佢

437
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
佢自己對公義要求投射到一個

438
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
歷史上必然嘅

439
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
無產階級必勝嘅一個咁嘅未來

440
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
但亦都講唔出呢個未來嘅

441
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
無產階級社會究竟excellent係點樣

442
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
咁所以我哋可以睇返

443
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
佢哋所謂嘅投射

444
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
將宗教成日就好好投射

445
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
去解釋

446
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
咁好多時候我哋可以講返就話其實

447
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
無神論會唔會係投射呢

448
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
你譬如佛洛伊德佢成日話

449
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
因為啲人鍾意要天父安慰你

450
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
所以就作個天父出嚟

451
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
佛洛伊德根本潛意識有對父親嘅憎恨

452
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
所以佢將對父親嘅憎恨

453
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
投射成無神論呢

454
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
咁事實上有個心理學家叫Paul Wiss

455
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
就寫本書

456
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
叫The Unconscious of

457
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Froy咁上下嘅

458
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
就話係研究返Froy

459
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
年少嘅經驗呢

460
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
佢原來佢細個時候係比個天主教嘅

461
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
一個工人

462
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
但後尾呢佢成日

463
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
同埋成日帶Froy去禮拜堂

464
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
所以佢係自細呢

465
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
佢本身係猶太人嚟嘅但呢

466
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
佢都有參加過禮拜堂

467
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
亦都受過宗教思想影響

468
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
佢到死果日仍然都係寫宗教書嘅

469
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
講Moses and Monophysicum

470
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
但係呢就後尾呢

471
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
喺屋企入面發覺呢個佢個工人呢

472
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
係懷疑偷嘢

473
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
後尾就炒魷魚

474
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
會唔會就係正如Froy所講三歲定八十

475
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
佢對宗教嘅失望同埋

476
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
佢個反對呢就沿住

477
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
呢個細個呢個宗教代表

478
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
呢個天主教呢個本來係咁親愛嘅

479
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
figure但係呢就失去咗

480
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
佢嘅Betray嘅trust

481
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
俾呢個家庭炒咗於是形成佢係無神論

482
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
所以全套系統都可以

483
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Dismiss唔使多講嘅原來

484
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
只不過Froy自己個人嘅投射出嚟嘅

485
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
所以好多時候呢

486
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
我可以睇返Hank Soon

487
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
好豐富嘅好多唔同嘅路數

488
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
去回應佢哋即係你好似

489
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
其實你成日話我係投射你嗰啲唔通

490
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
你任你up嘅姐你都可能投射

491
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
無神論

492
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
呢度都係值得睇

493
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
嚟咗度呢

494
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
我呢就就先講過我

495
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
啲時間真係好唔夠呢

496
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
我調過啦

497
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
第五頁第五章

498
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
終極信任

499
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
所以個Fundamental Trust

500
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
首先呢佢喺度呢

501
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
就係呢張裏面開頭重新呢

502
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
主客睇嗰個融和

503
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
最重要其實

504
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
呢段說話講嚟做乜嘢呢

505
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
因為好多時候呢

506
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
其實喺宗教旨入面都係個進度

507
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
我叫做一個所謂呢

508
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
缺責嘅進度或者用意志去進度

509
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
雖然理性證明唔到嘅嘢

510
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
但你可以用意志去相信

511
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
呢最出名呢就係William James

512
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
同埋Pascal都叫Pascal's Rager

513
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
呢個巴斯卡嘅賭博

514
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
佢先就話你又算唔信上帝

515
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
你博一博你計下邊個好啲

516
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
好似而家我哋

517
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
通常嘅所謂叫Cost Benefit Analysis

518
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
咁你相信上帝

519
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
如果冇咗上帝咪只係比人

520
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
呃一世咋嘛死咗又冇嘢啦

521
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
咁唔係好大事本咋嘛

522
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
但係如果有上帝你唔信將來入地獄永恆嘅受苦

523
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
好大鑊㗎喎

524
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
咁計我條數呢

525
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
都係信上帝好啲

526
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
個封建比較少啲

527
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
而你如果咁啱博一博博中咗呢

528
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
有無限嘅天堂福樂

529
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
你個計埋條數邊變盞呀咁當然信上帝好呀

530
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
咁所以如果唔係

531
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
好喜歡理性大嘅話呢就咁計意志嚟講

532
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
都係信上帝好

533
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
咁呢個就叫Pascals Rage

534
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
當然Pascals思想唔係咁使喙嘅其實呢

535
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
就仲有好深度嘅思想嘅

536
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
但係呢個事件唔夠詳細講

537
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
呢個進度由Pascals去Villiam James

538
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
都係強烈有時有啲嘢理性決定唔到

539
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
但係你生存可以去抉擇

540
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
同埋你都可以訴諸一啲嘅抉擇嘅理由

541
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
咁Hansung都係都要想講

542
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
其實主觀因素和客觀因素呢

543
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
其實係我哋嘅全息世界裏面呢

544
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
其實係分唔開

545
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
有啲人就所謂嘅

546
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
理性主義者就完全反對

547
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
生存嘅考慮

548
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
佢認為最緊要就係客觀嘅真實

549
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
先可以去抉擇先可以相信

550
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
如果唔係就係唔成實

551
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
但係我哋睇返其實係我哋世界上嘅信念裏面呢

552
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
唔係咁簡單嘅

553
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
所以我自己都比較同意其實呢可以用一啲

554
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
生存嘅考慮呢嚟到去考慮

555
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
信仰算唔算窄

556
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
或者你錄版

557
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
咁呢但係信任嘅態度

558
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
始終嚟講好多人

559
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
特別係理性主義嘅

560
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
即係傳統當中呢係好可疑嘅

561
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
覺得唔夠理性

562
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
咁所以其實呢Hansun用咗

563
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
三方面嘅角度呢

564
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
再去justify一種trust

565
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
其實呢係acceptable或者係

566
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
recommendable嘅

567
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
三方面第一從個心理角度去

568
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
去解釋其實佢話其實

569
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
即係其中一個佢舉例之類

570
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
叫Erickson 唔知有冇讀過

571
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
叫Erick

572
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Erickson 咁佢認為人生呢

573
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
其實有七八個階段呢

574
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
都係由兩個極端中去選擇嘅

575
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
咁人生嘅心理問題

576
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
就視乎你個選擇當中呢

577
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
選擇係唔係啱

578
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
佢認為唔係嬰兒生出嚟其實選擇係咩呢

579
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
大家如果讀個心態就係呢

580
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
trust or distrust

581
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
信任定唔信任呢

582
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
如果細路仔冇愛

583
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
冇人愛石冇人同佢笑呢

584
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
大家返嚟唔好成日對嬰兒

585
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
好惡咁就唔得嘅咁

586
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
要嚇死佢一生人

587
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
佢信任㗎啦

588
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
成日對佢笑呢

589
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
咁somehow有個實驗做過呢就話呢

590
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
如果有啲父母

591
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
真係關心去照顧佢呢

592
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
嬰兒呢啲病痛呀受命都長啲

593
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
有啲如果掂畀啲護士都唔理佢呢

594
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
咁其實嗰啲呢表現就有啲

595
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
腰折有啲有好多病痛

596
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
咁佢就指出其實呢

597
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
成長個人當中呢其實

598
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
人就要建立一個合理嘅信任

599
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
你如果喺嬰兒時期建立唔到

600
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
信任你根本唔係個健全嘅人生

601
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
咁呢個就係從developmental角度嚟講

602
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
其實trust呢係有需要嘅

603
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
好老實就唔係好似

604
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
李靖主席咁抽嚟呢就覺得成日信任呢

605
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
就好似好似個bad thing咁樣

606
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
信心好似

607
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
你好似唔掂先要信心

608
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
咁所以其實回返剛才嗰段說話其實

609
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
剛才佢坑叔係

610
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
前幾章已經講過啦

611
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
日常生活都需要信心呢個說話好重要

612
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
其實你

613
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
from day one你已經需要信心

614
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
每一次嘅媽咪整個奶瓶側埋嚟你點知乜嚟嘅

615
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
嘅

616
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
奶又好或者係

617
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
啲毒素又好

618
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
或者成瓶係D咩H5N1菌都好

619
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
或者沙士菌都好你都係飲嘅

620
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
你唔信你乜嘢都係死緊嘅都係

621
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
咁呢就相當於人生裏面

622
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
day one你都需要trust嘅

623
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
其他後期更加有個quotation係

624
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
52到54嗰段返嚟大家自己睇啦

625
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
第二個重要呢就係話呢

626
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
其實科學最後都

627
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
需要trust呢個

628
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
數據呢一個carp upper其實

629
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
同埋Thomas Kuhn嗰個理論

630
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
就知道其實科學冇絕對

631
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
驗證到最後科學驗證

632
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
個啲規則其實都係人去定嘅

633
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
個社群去定出嚟某程度

634
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
你相信人個判斷係啱

635
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
你相信人個理性本身

636
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
所以佢就好鍾意引carp upper

637
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
自己承認到最後carp upper

638
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
好得意嘅講嘅說話我對理性

639
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
注意嘅信心呢carp upper自己承認

640
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
最後係建基一個

641
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
對理性嘅非理性

642
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
嘅信任大家唔知聽唔聽

643
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
佢講乜嘢佢話其實佢點解選理性

644
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
注意呢到最後

645
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
因為我相信理性

646
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
但係佢話我相信理性證明唔到

647
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
所以從呢個角度嚟講我對理性嘅信任

648
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
本身係非理性

649
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
同埋佢第二個理由講

650
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
佢相信理性主因為佢覺得理性促進和平

651
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
唔使乜事用暴力解決

652
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
咁但係佢認為選擇暴力

653
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
唔選擇選擇和平唔選擇暴力

654
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
都係一個非理性嘅抉擇

655
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
因為係歐洲傳統裡面呢係個時候對倫理

656
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
都好懷疑就有客觀嘅基礎

657
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
因為到後期去到一路

658
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
即係呢個卡爾奧特爾·阿布爾

659
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
或者哈巴默斯

660
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
一路都係搞緊一樣嘅就係

661
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
喺後現代當中想搵一個共通嘅

662
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
語言同埋倫理嘅基礎

663
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
咁但係其實哈巴默斯都嘗試用一個

664
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
所謂一個叫做呢

665
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
即係一個speech

666
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
的pragmatics嘅角度呢

667
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
想justify呢啲嘅norms

668
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
咁其實係哈巴默斯

669
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
冇幾耐咋咋但係

670
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
係本書裡面呢坑蘇已經對佢提出批評

671
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
佢認為其實佢個種嘅

672
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
approach亦都唔能夠正立到呢

673
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
呢啲norms

674
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
詳細呢都唔夠時常講

675
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
科學都需要信任

676
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
第三倫理需要信任

677
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
呢件裡面呢我覺得最精彩呢

678
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
就係去引呢個

679
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Horkheimer 即係呢個critical theories

680
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
佢引咗好多

681
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
我之前都睇過下

682
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
但我未睇Horkheimer嘅原著

683
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
我唔知係咪已經明白我睇完之後都好興趣

684
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
再研究呢個問題

685
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
呢Horkheimer係本身一個無神論者

686
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
或者一路都係不可知論

687
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
或者用無神論傾向

688
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
係德國所謂的Frankfurt School

689
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
一個代表

690
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
但係佢臨死之前開始講到上帝嘅問題

691
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
大家睇呢105頁

692
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
106個quotation

693
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
咁裡面呢佢就講到呢好得意

694
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
佢自己去到臨尾開始承認

695
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
其實如果冇咗上帝呢終極永遠

696
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
真理同埋價值呢

697
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
甚至正義呢都冇根基

698
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
佢承認其實Horkheimer

699
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
其實諗一個問題其實

700
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
係一個Frankfurt School 入面最重要就係

701
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
為世界爭取正義

702
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
佢意思就話就算我將來爭取到正義

703
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
係過往無辜起身

704
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
果一年嘅suffering又點呢

705
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
係歷史入面佢哋尋白無聲嗰種嘅控訴

706
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
冇人紀念已經過去都冇人知道

707
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
呢個圖畫都係非常之令人

708
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
可以話係

709
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
不安同埋好唔圓滿嘅

710
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
你所訴諸

711
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
嗰種直目

712
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
最原味嘅正義到最後

713
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
唔知難不難實現都可能係好遙遠嘅未來

714
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
咁講啲人嘅受苦又點樣呢

715
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
呢個世界有冇真正嘅公義呢

716
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
呢個宇宙

717
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
所以係你睇到最後呢

718
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
你個Protection 自己讀一讀下

719
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
係第一

720
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
係尾二嗰段

721
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
臨11116頁嘅佢嗰度咁講下

722
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
從實際主義觀點來睇呢

723
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
根本無法得出有關正義上嘅道德結論

724
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
從實際上嚟到講呢

725
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
恨並不比愛更壞

726
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
我諗呢個唔係神

727
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
可能同科學呢個有啲問題呢度

728
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
所以講從理性嘅度嚟講呢

729
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
恨並不比愛更壞

730
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
雖然其社會功能可以不同

731
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
並不存在具有邏輯結論意義嘅論點顯示

732
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
我唔應該恨

733
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
只要我並無因為咁樣而喺社會生活中處於不利嘅地位

734
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
如果冇咗超人嘅權威

735
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
即係超過人嘅權威

736
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
咁呢就唔可以證明呢

737
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
戰爭係差過和平

738
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
自由係好過壓迫等等

739
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
所以呢佢就指出到就話呢

740
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
去到最後就係

741
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
當你爭取社會正義

742
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
但係你發生社會正義到最後

743
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
你其實有一啲好重要嘅價值

744
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
對正義嘅執著

745
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
但係對正義嘅執著你就第一處理唔到

746
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
實前上面

747
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
在歷史入面咁多受唔正義受苦

748
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
嗰啲人嗰啲苦難

749
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
嗰啲唔正義

750
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
但係其實呢個問題其實有根源嘅喺歐洲入面

751
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
呢個係康德我明顯係康德嘅根源

752
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
康德就問呢個得福一致嘅問題

753
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
咁我又有一篇文專文

754
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
係寫呢個大家可以睇個

755
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
睇個Fluix有時都可以見到

756
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
咁另外一個問題就係

757
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
嗰個基本價值你追求正義

758
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
你追求自由唔係壓迫

759
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
你追求和平唔係戰爭

760
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
追求恨愛唔係恨你點知

761
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
前者全部係後者

762
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
好多時候我哋自己有個假設

763
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
如果真係有一個獨裁者好似薩達姆

764
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
或者Vinladen

765
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
或者希特拉我define你呀

766
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
我係覺得要侵略

767
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
我要屠殺600萬人

768
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
你打贏我咪打贏我咪打贏我

769
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
打贏我咪拎埋地牢自殺囉

770
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
薩達姆就冇吉斯自殺啦

771
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
咁但係到最後

772
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
佢而家都唔肯認佢自己錯

773
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
因為自己好啱㗎 你點證明佢都錯呢

774
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
如果冇超越人嘅標準

775
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
好呀第七頁

776
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
所以係到最後呢

777
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
呢度黎講呢

778
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Hanshwin就指出到呢

779
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
你要信任啦 所以從呢個角度黎講呢

780
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
嗰種對友臣論嘅非理性

781
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
嘅質疑其實呢個

782
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
淡化咗啦 所以如果既然

783
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
生有嘅嘢都係要信任 所以即係話

784
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
其實喺我地面前就有一啲

785
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
fundamental options 冇乜嘢係絕對證明到嘅

786
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
咁如果冇乜嘢絕對

787
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
證明到唔係代表乜都唔做喎

788
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
咁我應該選擇一啲option呢

789
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
能夠解決更多同埋更加重要嘅問題

790
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
就唔應該選擇解決唔到問題

791
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
嗰啲嘢嘛 其實係咪好合理嘅咁樣講法

792
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
所以如果從呢個角度黎講呢

793
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
第七第六點就開出就話呢

794
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
頭先講過就好多一啲

795
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
基本倫理嘅問題啦 基本倫理嘅價值

796
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
尤其特別呢

797
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
呢一點呢喺Hans Gronk

798
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
佢被天主教取消咗個

799
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
正式天主教神學家嘅身份之後呢

800
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
佢形成一本書嘅

801
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
佢話我為什麼形成一個基督徒

802
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
咁當然呢個係廣義 英文呢個係

803
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
叫做Catholic

804
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
咁呢就

805
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
其實我睇過嗰陣時

806
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
其實佢最基本嘅論點呢

807
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
佢認為佢仲係一個基督徒

808
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
唔係因為個教廷嘅原因

809
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
而係因為佢仍然係服應呢個

810
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
基督教嘅信仰 而佢認為係呢一個

811
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
現代一個充滿著災難

812
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
同埋壓迫同反人權等嘅事入面呢

813
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
佢一個信仰

814
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
起碼對佢嚟講係一個最好為

815
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
人嘅尊嚴提供根基嘅一個

816
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
信念

817
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
呢個大家可能覺得 而家好多人都唔信上帝都係

818
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
西方自由主義者

819
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
都相信人嘅尊嚴

820
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
呢個大家要去返個歐陸個後現代

821
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
處境去明白 無錯有啲人實踐上都可以

822
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
咁樣做 但Hans Gronk唔係話你唔係

823
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
基督徒你就唔可以執述人嘅尊嚴

824
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
佢問一個更加根本嘅問題就話

825
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
你點樣能夠正立人嘅尊嚴

826
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
點樣能夠肯定人

827
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
喺呢個世界入面你係同其他物件唔同

828
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
咁所以呢大家去睇呢

829
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
就係第七頁

830
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
後面嗰幾個呢

831
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
其實都好

832
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
基本上人嗰個倫理嘅價值

833
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
人道啊 慈愛 同埋呢

834
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
第八頁嗰度呢 人嘅價值

835
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
人嘅尊嚴嗰度呢 佢就指出到其實呢

836
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
特別對倫理嗰個

837
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
迫切性 嗰個絕對性

838
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
你無錯你可能覺得

839
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
人嘅尊嚴相對我比較文明啲

840
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
但如果有啲人能夠有能力

841
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
唔受呢個文明嘅制約

842
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
佢可唔可以為所欲為呢

843
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
咁所以其實去到最後呢 佢認為呢

844
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
一個絕對對人嘅尊嚴嘅肯定呢

845
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
你都需要一個絕對嘅基礎

846
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
如果你將呢樣嘅東西

847
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
台為絕對

848
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
但你將佢嘅基礎只不過係一種

849
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
隨著歷史演變嘅國際公約啊

850
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
社會共識啊 嗰啲會轉變

851
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
所以佢講嗰個說話你一個

852
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
咁uncondition嘅

853
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
commitment to human rights

854
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
你需要一個unconditioned

855
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
ground

856
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
但所以呢個其實係一個論點好重要

857
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
就話呢 我哋要解釋嘅嘢

858
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
我哋要能夠提供個解釋

859
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
要合乎嗰個性質

860
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
佢唔係話好多人就質疑咋

861
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
唔係幾乎都可以講倫理 無錯

862
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
但係好多時我哋再睇返倫理嘅深刻嘅精神

863
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
我哋就問就話 倫理

864
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
嗰種真正嘅精神

865
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
有啲咩先能夠充分解釋佢呢

866
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
但係呢個坑叔係一個好強嘅

867
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
當時佢認為倫理係一個絕對嘅要求

868
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
即係話你基本上唔可以侵犯人嘅尊嚴

869
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
你基本上要肯定人嘅尊嚴

870
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
因為呢個係一個好絕對嘢

871
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
但係而家現今我自己都研究過

872
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
一輪呢個問題嘅

873
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
如果係secular theories

874
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
講嚟講嚟到最後得兩招

875
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
第一 而家世界大趨勢係咁樣

876
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
唔好諗咩基礎

877
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
大家都跟呢個潮流就得啦

878
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
第二 就話呢個滿足人嘅需要

879
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
滿足人嘅interest

880
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
但係如果根本唔重視人嘅interest

881
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
唔重視人嘅需要呢

882
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
你根本就可以否定人權嘅

883
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
所以我自己都同意坑叔呢點

884
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
其實呢 最後呢

885
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
呢個係需要一種宗教

886
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
或者超越嘅根基

887
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
比較能夠有一種更加強嘅基礎

888
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
好 咁就

889
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
就叫大約介紹完

890
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
點出一啲我認為比較精彩的quotation

891
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
好 講講佢嘅評論

892
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
John Mackey呢

893
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
就係一個英美嘅分析哲學家嚟嘅

894
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
佢寫本書就叫The Miracle of Theism

895
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
呢本書就唔係話

896
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Theism係咩神蹟

897
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
即係話好正嘅

898
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
其實佢引用阿謙呢

899
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
阿謙呢 其實講個說話 佢就話呢

900
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
佢就唔明去到今日咁現代咁科學

901
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
仍然有咁多人呢 仍然係相信有神嘅存在

902
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
呢個真係神蹟嚟啦咁樣

903
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
所以呢本書嘅書名

904
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
其實係咁意思

905
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The Miracle of Theism就話呢

906
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
竟然竟然經過啟蒙主義理性主義洗禮

907
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
仍然仲有咁多讀智學

908
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
仍然係相信有神

909
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
呢樣嘢本身就係神蹟

910
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
咁佢本來係一個諷刺嚟嘅

911
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
咁我自己覺得真係神蹟嚟嘅

912
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
因為上帝動工喺人類文化當中

913
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
咁所以就能解釋到啦

914
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
咁多人仍然仍相信上帝存在

915
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
咁佢有啲style嘅批評

916
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
我唔多講啦 第一點

917
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
去到第二點 第三點

918
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
佢講神嘅概念 我覺得佢嘅批評

919
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
春無求辭 主要係指曬啲讀呢

920
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
就其實可以解答到

921
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
其實Hans Goon喺第二章同埋第七章呢

922
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
都有個釐清 不過其實呢個問題

923
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
就指出到佢嗰個

924
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
有時佢都係嗰個系統性

925
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
嗰個論證嗰個結構唔係譬如話

926
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
咁清楚 咁所以就亦都招嚟批評

927
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
但依你唔準係講啦

928
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
好啦 跟住去睇第九版啦

929
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
咁John Mackey

930
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
就批評佢就話呢

931
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Koon has rather exaggerated threat

932
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
that there is some realities

933
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
beyond doubt the extreme of nihilism

934
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
would be to deny

935
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that reality is discoverable

936
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
or understandable

937
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
but there is no serious case for this denial

938
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
但佢意思就係話呢

939
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
其實佢相信佢翻了一半理性主義嘅方法嚟講

940
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
冇錯 我只要唔擴定大呢

941
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
我可以不斷相信佢係錯

942
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
可能會錯 依度所謂

943
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
fallibilityism 但係我係不斷地驗證啦

944
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
我相信呢個宇宙有秩序 冇錯

945
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
阿Mackey就話我可能

946
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
而家證實唔到 但我相信佢之後

947
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
我繼續去睇 咦

948
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
事實上面都仍然有秩序喎

949
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
我放多啲資料真係會跌落嚟㗎喎

950
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
不斷放放落機都會跌落嚟㗎喎

951
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
冇停㗎喎

952
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
呢個識㗎唔怕打落機呀

953
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
所以呢

954
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
試驗咗啦

955
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
我呢個可以test 佢啦

956
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
所以我相信將來都有秩序啦

957
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
基本嘅信念都可以去試驗嘅

958
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
用返呢個經驗嘅方法

959
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
呢個其實呢

960
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
我只覺得呢就係

961
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
英美係比較樂觀嘅 我自己就比較

962
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
同優樂嗰種對

963
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
基本嘅reality 中批判啦 如果你真係諗落去呢

964
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
我覺得理性真係證明唔到

965
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
即係單純理性係證明唔到呢個世界

966
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
有秩序證明唔到呢個世界

967
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
有reality

968
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
即係頭先都教講過少少

969
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
我今日根本如果reality全部係simulation

970
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
就好簡單用返現今科的道理嚟講

971
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
即係呢個virtual reality嘅概念

972
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
即係你可以imagine

973
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
你自己所有嘢好似好real嘅

974
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
experiences 全部都係simulation

975
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
而你係裏面你

976
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
完全discover唔到任何嘅

977
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
分辨呢兩個嘅嘢

978
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
同埋論理嗰個唔多講

979
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
就係規律嗰樣嚟講

980
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
其實係呢度嚟講呢

981
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
其實Join Mackey 嘅方法亦都

982
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
跳唔出批評者 Hema 早已經講咗啦

983
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
你如果想證明規律法

984
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
規律法就係話呢

985
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
而家我哋嘅秩序可以證明

986
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
將來嘅秩序 比如話

987
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
而家太陽都係從東方升起㗎啦 所以我相信呢

988
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
未來就從東方升起

989
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
咁你挑戰得啦 你咁樣做已經假設世界有秩序啦

990
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
咁Mackey 嘅師姐

991
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
就話好啦呢個都係假設

992
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
我再證明囉 你而家睇下有秩序 將來又發咗秩序

993
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
一路都發咗秩序

994
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
所以將來仲有秩序啦

995
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
咁但係其實如果你以細諗嘅時候呢

996
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
其實從理性嚟講 佢冇答到個問題就係話

997
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
佢而家人哋挑戰

998
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
就話呢啲問題係由而家嘅規律

999
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
譬如而家嘅太陽升起都係從東方升起

1000
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
跳到將來太陽又從東方升起

1001
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
咁但係你同樣道理

1002
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
你都唔能 如果你係質疑呢樣嘢嘅時候

1003
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
你由而家有秩序 挑戰到將來有秩序

1004
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
咁呢個咪係正正假設咗一種秩序囉 係咪 明唔明嘢師姐

1005
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
你話而家有秩序 挑戰到將來有秩序 都係假設有秩序

1006
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
係不變嘅

1007
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
所以其實呢個我哋如果從此嚟講 係一個Begging Question

1008
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
唔係一個真正嘅論據

1009
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
係一個循環論證嚟㗎

1010
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
咁同埋有啲人可能咁諗

1011
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
有啲人就相信 譬如假設有一個人呢

1012
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
就認為咁樣嘅 個世界秩序會成日變嘅

1013
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
即可能呢

1014
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
就三百 即三千年就一個秩序

1015
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
跟住呢 跟住就會轉㗎啦

1016
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
其實呢 如果從呢個角度嚟講 同我哋經驗都唔吻合㗎喎

1017
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
明唔明嘅意思呀

1018
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
即你 而家因為我哋有嘅經驗 即得遲 應該頭咗十三千年

1019
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
假設 你唔好當三千年 當一萬年

1020
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
好啦

1021
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
假設依家一樣 歷史有一萬年有記載

1022
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
有記載歷史入面呢一萬年都係有秩序嘅

1023
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
依舊我哋就話

1024
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
跟住十萬年 一百萬年都係有秩序啦

1025
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
咁呢個係非依家嘅經驗啦

1026
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
但有啲人就話

1027
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
可能呢個世界每個一萬年嘅秩序就會

1028
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
到顛倒一次嘅

1029
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
同樣同依家我哋經驗吻合過

1030
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
係咪

1031
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
咁同埋正正就因為我哋依家咁耐都

1032
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
有秩序呢 就可能

1033
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
更加證明我哋個秩序會改變

1034
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
嘅機會更加大啦 依如果按照唔同嘅

1035
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
假設

1036
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
即我哋假設依家又有兩個

1037
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
System 一個System呢

1038
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
就係一個Department head一個人做咗之後

1039
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
永遠都係做㗎啦

1040
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
但另一個System呢就係Department head呢

1041
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
會輪住做㗎啦

1042
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
如果大家System入面你見到呢個

1043
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
肥仔做咗十年呢 你肯定佢

1044
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
就當然出年佢又做㗎啦 因為佢永遠唔會轉㗎啦

1045
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
但如果係一個On shift system呢你見到做咗十年呢

1046
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
佢肯定出年一定唔係你 因為你已經

1047
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
做夠啦

1048
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
同樣你可以用兩個History

1049
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
去解釋依一萬年嘅秩序

1050
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
一個係On shift system 一個係

1051
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Keep住一個

1052
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
揮去落去嘅 所以你由依家

1053
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
個秩序證明將來有秩序呢 亦都係

1054
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
已經假設咗前者唔係後者 但明唔明

1055
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
我講乜嘢 所以呢個呢

1056
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
從理性嚟講呢你都係分唔到

1057
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
兩個可能性嘅

1058
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
咁咪第二個更加嚴重嘅問題呢

1059
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
John Mackey好得意 佢寫本書

1060
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
叫Affix

1061
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Inventing right and wrong

1062
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
倫理學

1063
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
大家話呢叫做創造對與錯

1064
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
咁呢就因為

1065
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
呢就因為呢

1066
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
佢裏面正正就因為佢係一個自然主義者

1067
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
無神論者呢 佢正正就因為

1068
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
咁嘅原因呢佢認為呢

1069
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
倫理個絕對要求 因為其實好得意

1070
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
嘅 你不可以

1071
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
去接受一些違反人嘅尊嚴

1072
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
你任何時衷你都要遵守

1073
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
其實Mackey仲有一個無神論者

1074
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
佢正正覺得好奇怪喎 因為佢有咩經驗基礎呢

1075
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
有咩藥劑 有咩能夠去

1076
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
提供一個咁嘅基礎呢

1077
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
於是佢到最後其實Mackey本身

1078
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
正正就認咗阿Koon嗰個嘅批評

1079
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
佢到最後就

1080
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
否定有客觀價值 佢認為倫理係冇

1081
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
真假嘅 咁倫理點嚟嘅

1082
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
倫理係人嘅發明嚟嘅

1083
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
好似今日我哋

1084
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
我哋嗰啲公仔

1085
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
好似我哋嗰啲文學作品

1086
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
全部都人嘅發明嚟

1087
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
可以唔存在 咁但係佢認為呢

1088
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
呢個發明都合理 因為呢 只有創造呢個

1089
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
倫理價值呢 人先能夠和平

1090
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
共處 唔會呢摧毀大家

1091
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
但係呢個回答呢

1092
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
係極之不足嘅

1093
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
因為就算人去創造一個秩序

1094
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
維持個社會穩定

1095
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
但係佢可以創造好多種唔同嘅社會嘅

1096
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
事實上我從歷史裡面睇 奴隸社會

1097
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
或者創造一個社會

1098
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
男女好唔平等嘅 或者創造一個社會

1099
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
逢係性關嘅就做奴隸嘅

1100
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
其他人呢就係做主人嘅

1101
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
呢個社會都好穩定我相信

1102
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
雖然我唔係好鍾意會喺呢個社會當中

1103
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
呢個兄弟都可能唔鍾意佢同我同性嘅

1104
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
咁但係你

1105
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
可以設計咁嘅社會可以完全唔平等

1106
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
可以為返人嘅尊嚴 事實上呢個社會

1107
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
呢個世界就存在咗譬如總性階級

1108
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
佢呢個社會就係人分階級囉

1109
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
印度幾多年唔知幾穩定

1110
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
人互相摧毀其實好多方法

1111
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
呢部某一類人係奴隸

1112
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
但係然後幫佢不斷洗腦 一開始就教佢

1113
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
你係洗腳妹嘅

1114
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
你就應該做呢樣嘢㗎啦

1115
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
你嫁入黎我呢個咩家就要做我哋洗腳妹㗎啦

1116
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
咁樣 你睇朝亞之都好開心嘅

1117
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
你睇下佢都好...一路唔覺得咩問題㗎喎

1118
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
遲世將佢洗腦咪得囉

1119
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
都好穩定㗎喎社會

1120
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
咁所以如果人

1121
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
個價值月先人創造出黎

1122
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
佢好簡單地講就話

1123
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
John Mackey本身係一個好典型嘅

1124
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Liberal嚟㗎 肯定唔好適合奴隸社會

1125
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
即係我即係話其實

1126
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
佢呢個所謂倫理創造學說呢

1127
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
完全解釋唔到

1128
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
而家基本上我哋接受嗰啲普世嘅價值觀

1129
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
第二樣嘢

1130
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
如果人類創造價值

1131
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
只不過係為咗生存

1132
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
有啲人就話啦

1133
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
如果冇倫理價值大家亂嚟

1134
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
咁隨時比人老粒㗎喎

1135
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
隨時比人湯㗎喎

1136
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
但係呢個批評呢就

1137
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
對一般人就...呢個講法對一般人

1138
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
可以應用

1139
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
但如果有一個好強嘅人呢

1140
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
有一個獨裁者

1141
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
佢有好多中心嘅國衛兵

1142
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
咁樣護住佢呢

1143
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
佢咪可以統治獨裁幾十年

1144
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
咁唔好取一個咁蠢嘅布殊去打佢咋嘛

1145
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
其實布殊咁樣做

1146
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
其實係一個神蹟嚟㗎真係

1147
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
因為其實佢去冇天下之意

1148
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
大大不諱其實你啱定錯都好呢

1149
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
其實呢就...佢咁樣做

1150
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
其實係一個非常之...即係

1151
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
從歷史嚟講呢 如果唔係佢爭

1152
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
嗰十幾二十票呢

1153
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
喺法羅利亞州選咗出嚟

1154
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
佢個肯定就唔會打伊拉克

1155
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
我同你地講 剛剛爭幾十票

1156
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
選咗出嚟

1157
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
而佢又真係個人就...即係你話佢有信念

1158
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
又好 你話佢知又好啦

1159
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
總之就冇天下之大不諱 就係佢打佢

1160
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
做之最好就查問佢出嚟

1161
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
如果唔係呢咁多歷史嘅偶然呢

1162
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
薩達姆坐多嗰度三十年都未止

1163
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
佢同你講咩倫理呀

1164
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
佢唔使咪講倫理啫

1165
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
周圍都有佢影像 個個都怕晒佢

1166
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
佢有啲中心嘅士兵 家族

1167
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
擄斷晒所有嘢

1168
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
好安全㗎

1169
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
如果倫理只不過係要為大家

1170
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
互相共存 咁我地發覺到

1171
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
如果對於強人

1172
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
佢冇咩需要呢啲倫理嘅

1173
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
咁所以佢倫理只不過係用嚟保護弱者

1174
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
呢個正正就係彌彩嘅批評

1175
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
佢話倫理就用嚟保護弱者嘅

1176
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
佢用呢個角度就否定倫理

1177
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
個價值

1178
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
所以呢Joy Mackey呢其實我覺得

1179
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
就唔係能夠好搭到

1180
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
同埋Hans Gronz指出到我覺得係非常好

1181
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
因為責任嘅絕對性嘅問題

1182
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
如果道德價值唔得係有道德價值

1183
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
仲有一種絕對性嘅話呢

1184
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
有責任嘅絕對性嘅時候呢

1185
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
用一啲其他方法去justify

1186
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
係好多嘅conditions

1187
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
就唔難有一種uncondition嘅

1188
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
obligation

1189
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
咁Mackey呢就完全冇討論呢樣嘢

1190
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
基本上我地咁講 Mackey就投降

1191
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
正正就因為佢係無信任者

1192
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
大家可以睇佢本嘅ethics eventing right and wrong

1193
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
正正因為佢覺得呢個世界唔可能

1194
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
存在道德價值 佢就採取咗一個

1195
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
相對主義嘅方法

1196
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
好啦 下一個批評呢

1197
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
就話呢

1198
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
佢又批評呢就Hans Gronz

1199
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
認為相信上帝呢

1200
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
就會有一個self verifying嘅過程

1201
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
喺個書裏面呢佢用一個叫做

1202
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
intrinsic reasonableness嘅嘢

1203
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
佢意思就話有時呢信任嘅嘢呢

1204
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
信任之前係證明唔到

1205
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
你都唔能夠抽離佢 係之後去

1206
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
實驗去證明 但Hans Gronz提出

1207
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
個概念就話呢 信任

1208
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
你相信呢個現實呢

1209
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
你相信當中 你當下你仍然一種

1210
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
內在嘅合理性

1211
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
呢個概念其實佢唔係

1212
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
展譯得好多 知識得好多

1213
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
我覺得呢個都係佢本書嘅一個弱點

1214
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
不過 我諗到佢已經寫咗成千頁

1215
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
咁都唔怪佢啦 因為再寫落去呢

1216
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
更加睇唔得完

1217
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
但係呢度呢我就覺得可用個比喻

1218
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
其實都有提過嘅 人際關係

1219
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
比喻 例如我想知道一個人可唔可以

1220
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
信任 其實都有提過 但係

1221
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
佢冇將佢串連一齊

1222
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
我哋好難話之前 我哋話

1223
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
一個人係咪信嘅朋友 或者係咪

1224
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
符合終生嘅伴侶呢咁樣

1225
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
係咪我之前玩個C加清單查曬佢起曬佢啲底

1226
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
整個花入去講 係啦

1227
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
呢個就可以同佢結婚㗎啦

1228
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
冇用㗎

1229
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
但係好多時候 你喺個待遇當中呢

1230
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
你要佢試驗 你就要同佢

1231
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
engage 你同佢進入一種嘅

1232
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
大家嘅交往嘅關係當中

1233
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
你去體驗 你好難

1234
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
可能你好難用語言

1235
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
或者客觀嘅證明去同人講 但係可能你去到

1236
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
一個地步 你feel到呢個人可以

1237
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
trust到 但係呢個係一個唔能夠用

1238
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
即係好規則嘅方法去展現

1239
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
嘅合理性 但係我哋唔能夠

1240
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
否認有時有啲嘢係

1241
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
喺個咁嘅實戰過程 實戰過程當中

1242
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
你體驗過合理性 咁所以我覺得

1243
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Hansome呢方面如果補充下呢都可以

1244
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
可以回應一下Mackey嘅

1245
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
咁第六

1246
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
第九班最後一點呢

1247
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
John Mackey提出 你用上帝解釋

1248
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
但係上帝好得意嘅 佢能夠用意念呢

1249
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
就直接產生

1250
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
呢啲效果嘅

1251
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
即係譬如話上帝話要有光

1252
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
就有光 上帝要有蟑螂

1253
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
蟑螂去飛出嚟啦

1254
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
上帝話要有菠蘿 咁有菠蘿爭咗出嚟啦

1255
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
咁樣

1256
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
上帝話要有光

1257
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
咁就有光啦

1258
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
咁呢就直接去認驗

1259
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
即係個意念直接喺呢個世界入面呢

1260
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
就有effect啦 咁佢認為

1261
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
呢樣嘢我哋冇客觀嘅經驗基礎

1262
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
呢點其實都係回應我老師

1263
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
即係Richard Springberg呢

1264
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
一個要點嚟嘅 所以佢認為

1265
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
有經驗基礎 咁樣嘅假設就唔合理

1266
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
呢度呢我只覺得

1267
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
呢個要求都係

1268
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
唔需要 要批評都唔成立

1269
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
因為其實我哋任何去到解釋整個宇宙終極

1270
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
一定同我哋一般嘅嘢

1271
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
有啲唔似嘅 如果同我哋一模一樣

1272
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
你又唔就搵呢張凳呀 用咩求其

1273
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
搵個人去解釋呢個宇宙呢

1274
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
解釋咁大嘅嘢 一定個人間

1275
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
有返上下power 上下獨特先解釋到㗎嘛

1276
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
咁所以我哋要

1277
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
解釋就一方面佢要有一種合理嘅model

1278
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
但另一方面呢佢要有充分嘅解釋能力

1279
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
呢個才係最重要嘅

1280
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
我哋唔好淨係睇休神論 我哋只係睇其他科學

1281
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
科學家去到最尾解釋

1282
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
要物質世界 整到好多啲咩

1283
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
夸克呀 黑洞呀

1284
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
時空旅行呀 嗰啲咁嘢出嚟

1285
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
嗰啲同我哋經驗好似咩

1286
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
嗰啲量子力學

1287
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
話嗰啲咩wave function 可以 overlap

1288
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
乜乜性呀 冇人知係咩嚟

1289
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
其實我導演科學都唔知係咩嚟

1290
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
嗰啲嘢都係 我導演engineering

1291
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
大家就照講一講

1292
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
講一講就好似G咁樣 我發覺這個世界就係咁樣

1293
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
同我嘅經驗都好唔似嘅

1294
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
但總之佢寫learn equation出嚟

1295
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
predict有啲嘢又好似

1296
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
啱咁樣 大家就當佢係啱嘅

1297
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
其實就講真嚟講 佢有咩wave mechanics

1298
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
都同我嘅經驗好唔似嘅

1299
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
所以去到其實 上科學去到中技

1300
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
好多嘢 一定同我個生命好唔似

1301
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
如果係因為咁唔似就否定嗰樣嘢呢

1302
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
其實就呢個太武斷 同埋我哋都要指出就話

1303
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
其實上帝

1304
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
用上帝解釋事物呢

1305
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
李天明上帝批評呢個

1306
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
藝說明咁樣

1307
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
但係其實這個基於一個我哋日常生活用嘅

1308
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
streamer好常講嘅

1309
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
叫personal explanation

1310
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
事實上我哋係用人

1311
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
去解釋好多嘢嘅 譬如話

1312
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
點解份筆記 你唔會話

1313
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
因為就係馬騮亂咁打電動打出嚟

1314
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
事實上呢個有可能

1315
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
可能唔係我寫嘅 有個馬騮打出嚟嘅

1316
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
我都冇寫下名喺度 其實有個馬騮

1317
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
打出嚟我順便用一用嘅

1318
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
大家應該唔會相信

1319
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
希望大家唔相信

1320
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
咁就

1321
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
咁但係你呢個你用人嘅意思

1322
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
人嘅意思能夠影響世界

1323
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
影響個電腦點樣運作

1324
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
可以影個printer出嚟

1325
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
當然有mechanical parts嘅

1326
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
部分 但係你相信人

1327
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
影響世界呢 呢樣嘢係一個

1328
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
我哋day to day都經驗到嘅事實

1329
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
上帝同我哋情況

1330
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
有啲唔同 佢個range

1331
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
係無限

1332
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
但係有限嘅例子呢

1333
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
我哋睇到人嘅精神能夠影響

1334
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
世界 咁呢樣嘢可以話係一個合理嘅

1335
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
basis 正於

1336
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
譬如話

1337
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
嗰啲mechanics

1338
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
假設一啲完全彈性

1339
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
好多嗰啲波波

1340
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
好似BD boss

1341
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
但係完全彈性 但係世界冇完全彈性嘅波

1342
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
但係我哋由

1343
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
有限嘅模型

1344
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
去到科學嘅基礎

1345
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
呢個都係科學合法嘅做法

1346
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
因為Mackie呢個批評都唔成立

1347
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
第十頁

1348
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
跟住佢都認為

1349
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
人 佢認為呢就係

1350
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
上帝都唔能為道德提供基礎

1351
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
呢個就有一個好古典嘅

1352
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
叫做Youthful Dilemma 呢個出於

1353
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
parietal嘅一個對話錄嘅

1354
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
有一個Youthful就提出一個問題

1355
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
佢就話呢 佢就究竟呢個啲嘢

1356
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
簡單嚟講就話呢

1357
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
乜嘢係

1358
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
虔誠呢 虔誠係

1359
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
係因為神愛嗰樣嘢

1360
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
唔係虔誠呢

1361
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
因為嗰樣係虔誠 嗰啲神先愛佢哋呢

1362
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
大家唔知聽唔聽得懂我地講咩

1363
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
簡單嚟講呢 其實用返到

1364
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
人哋個度嚟講呢 佢就問問題就話

1365
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
究竟一樣嘢係善

1366
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
係因為神畀個意志 神嘅意願

1367
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
係咁樣令到佢係善

1368
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
因為佢本身係善 神先去

1369
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
有意願係想實現呢

1370
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
咁樣 咁有個Dilemma就話

1371
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
如果嗰樣嘢本身係善啦 所以神知道

1372
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
佢係善 所以神就命令

1373
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
你就做呢樣嘢啦 咁就

1374
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
證明有一種善係獨立於上帝

1375
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
存在 咁上帝照樣

1376
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
係終極嚟㗎嘛 咁就唔啱啦

1377
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
但如果你話嗰樣嘢係善 只不過係

1378
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
因為上帝command佢

1379
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
咁如果上帝command你

1380
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
殺人放火 大屠殺咁樣

1381
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
大屠殺又變成善囉 咁就變成好

1382
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
arbitrary囉 所以你再你

1383
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Eyedown我兩條善呢

1384
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
呢個有神嘅倫理都係會

1385
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
崩潰嘅

1386
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
但呢一個嘅 youth revoice Dilemma

1387
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
喺當代中國哲學家經過無數

1388
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
討論呢 我覺得基本上已經提出

1389
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
十個八個solution已經有㗎啦

1390
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
咁呢就只有我自己buy

1391
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
最簡單嚟講呢

1392
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
兩個其實好多時候

1393
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
呢啲Dilemma呢 最簡單就係

1394
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
挑戰係咪就得兩個solution呢

1395
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
簡單嚟講呢 我就話呢

1396
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
上帝嘅善係建基於

1397
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
佢不變嘅慈愛本性

1398
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
佢嘅意志都係

1399
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
沿住佢本性 所以

1400
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
佢既既唔係arbitrary 亦都唔係

1401
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
獨立於佢自己 就可以解決呢個問題

1402
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
咁但係如果大家未聽得明呢

1403
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
就再睇下書啦

1404
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
跟住呢

1405
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Mackie就話其實上帝

1406
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
作為終極目標點解需要呢

1407
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
人自己有目標啦 所以

1408
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
唔需要搵上帝嚟到去賦予佢目標嘅

1409
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
呢個就唔明白就係目標呢

1410
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
其實當然啦 人好多目標啦

1411
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
有啲人一世鍾意打機 有啲人一世鍾意捉

1412
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
蟑螂 有啲人一世呢

1413
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
鍾意食琴渠 咩樣嘅 都好多目標嘅咁樣

1414
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
但唔係所有目標都係一個

1415
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
有意義嘅人生 喺呢度嚟講呢

1416
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
我地想問嘅一個生存嘅問題

1417
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
究竟有冇一種目標係

1418
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
能夠令我整個人生

1419
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
都能夠有一種好穩固嘅意義呢

1420
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
你去選擇我人生嘅目標就係

1421
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
我去打關島 打無限關島

1422
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
我有意義啦 或者個目標我係

1423
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
撩耳屎撩鼻屎 咁樣我人生嘅意義就係

1424
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
撩越多耳屎越好 就組織一個耳屎博物館呀

1425
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
諸如此類咁樣

1426
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
我人生目標就係要做一個耳屎大王咁樣

1427
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
你可以去諗呢啲嘢㗎

1428
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
但人哋覺得你係痴線無為

1429
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
但係等陣先講出啦

1430
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
冇上人哋會諗到個目標出嚟 個目標就係話

1431
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
即係好簡單

1432
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
你有選擇嘅目標

1433
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
你一生目標就係咩呢

1434
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
你選啦 即係食狗屎牛屎

1435
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
即係羊屎 或者再落去豬屎咩成咁啦

1436
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
你話咁搞笑呀 淨係得意啲

1437
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
你有好多選擇

1438
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
你去選擇個目標

1439
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
唔足夠建立好有意義嘅人生

1440
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
你仲會覺得嗰樣嘢啃得落先得嘅

1441
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
同埋能夠令你人生sustain你個life

1442
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
有目標先得㗎嘛

1443
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
即係個目標唔係只

1444
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
唔可以話求其無目標嘅 係個目標係令你覺得

1445
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
同生命有個resonance一種嘅動力

1446
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
慳叔係問緊呢樣嘢

1447
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
佢喺呢個講完當中

1448
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
佢就提到一個社會嘅虛無

1449
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
佢就喺虛無主義個chapter

1450
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
都有好多對現代社會嘅批評

1451
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
我覺得非常之好嘅

1452
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
頭先有啲quotation到 我冇時間讀

1453
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
大家可以返去自己睇下

1454
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
佢講到其實 離彩係一種好積極好激嘅虛無主義

1455
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
佢話而家嘅社會

1456
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
其實好似離彩咁樣

1457
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
但係已經採納咗離彩

1458
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
嗰種虛無主義 不過係一種消極

1459
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
沉默嘅虛無主義

1460
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
虛無主義個詩就係話

1461
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
要將所有價值顛倒 將最崇高嘅價值

1462
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
自我貶值

1463
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
你睇香港 其實唔係虛無主義咩

1464
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
日日嗰啲一本便利嗰啲咁cheap嘅嘢

1465
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
一本cheap嘢咁樣就走走街賣

1466
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
講明便利啦嘛

1467
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
真係好咁cheap

1468
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
咁呢就

1469
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
一面喺善勝色

1470
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
人再搵崇高嘅價值

1471
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
尋個當下嘅快樂

1472
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
人亦都唔去追尋咩有意義做嘅事

1473
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Han Sun所描述嘅

1474
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
我認同 亦都覺得

1475
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
現代社會其實已經進入虛無主義階段

1476
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
或者喺嗰個危機當中

1477
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
我自己覺得 所以

1478
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Mackey嗰個係原本一個

1479
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
學院式分析哲學 雖然我自己讀分析哲學

1480
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
但我哋對分析哲學都好失望嘅 呢啲係好學院式嘅哲學家

1481
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
咁我真實地睇

1482
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Han Sun嗰個特點就係呢

1483
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
一方面佢有哲學思維

1484
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
但佢係盡量結合嗰個歷史社會處境

1485
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
佢係識信上帝嗰個信仰

1486
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
係喺個時代嘅價值

1487
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
所以我自己覺得 而家點樣人

1488
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
咁虛無嘅原因就係因為

1489
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
你個人生冇終極目標

1490
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
你人冇一個 你生出嚟唔知為乜嘢

1491
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
你冇一個終極目標

1492
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
以前都係為家族 為家族榮譽

1493
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
為咗咩科學發展

1494
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
而家科學都冇人讀 大佬

1495
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
即除咗讀Business以外 冇人

1496
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
學我哋大學教書 冇咗科學吃香嘅

1497
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
都係人動人business 都未必搵到錢

1498
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
但佢覺得感覺上

1499
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
係實際啲Economics Business

1500
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
民方當然冇人hug 理方都冇人hug

1501
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
而家整個社會

1502
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
冇中國目標

1503
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
社會冇共生目標

1504
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
人就會選擇最immediate

1505
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
你感受到嘢 就係快樂 就係金錢

1506
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
呢個就虛無注意

1507
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
係實際上面而家對社會有危機

1508
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
所以Hans Soon其實有一個好rare嘅point

1509
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
我讀佢嗰本YMCAVITY嘅時

1510
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
都好感動 都係對我好大嘅激勵

1511
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
其實做交通唔係一定要

1512
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
同現代社會價值衝擊

1513
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
現代社會正正嘅價值危機

1514
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
就係話佢扣立咗好似

1515
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
普世價值 但係佢係下面

1516
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
嗰度抽晒嗰啲嘅根基

1517
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
嗰啲嘅板 因為好崇高

1518
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
講人權自由 但係有人權自由

1519
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
香港社會會變成點呢

1520
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
我都有啲擔心 所以我都仍然

1521
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
繼續支持民主自由 人權自由

1522
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
但係如果係香港繼續一個非道德化

1523
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
你反對

1524
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
都叫道德佬 比人話咩

1525
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
啊 道德恐怖主義 香港

1526
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
塔利班 諸如此類我都受到

1527
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
咁嘅風浩

1528
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
光明嘅風浩

1529
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
冇人夠膽再講道德問題

1530
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
咁嘅時候其實

1531
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
好多嘅嘢係非常

1532
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
conflict 嗰啲好崇高嘅價值

1533
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
其實冇實際嘅基礎

1534
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
我愈去諗

1535
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
我只覺得

1536
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
宗教信仰好重要 所以大家

1537
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
傳動一幅音 當然要傳一個正嘅

1538
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
幅音 結合思想

1539
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
現代精神入正幅音

1540
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
但其實我覺得現代人

1541
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
即係香港我自己體驗就係話

1542
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
短期你冇咗個信仰

1543
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
冇傳統冇出香港人都好似好decent

1544
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
但我睇到新嘅一代睇到呢個趨勢

1545
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
當你冇咗呢個社會精神

1546
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
基礎嘅時候呢 其實

1547
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
現代人好邏輯嘅 你話比

1548
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
真係世界人冇目的狀出嚟㗎嘛

1549
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
咁我咪搵自己快樂囉

1550
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
我點解講咁多崇高追尋

1551
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
呢樣果樣啫 我點犧牲自己

1552
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
自由舒服去服侍其他人犧牲

1553
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
自己 呢就係

1554
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
學Kymer問嘅問題啦

1555
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
新人貢獻正義

1556
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
但係佢最後畀佢諗返

1557
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
如果對其他人唔認同嘅時候

1558
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
佢能夠講咩呢?

1559
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
所以Mackey個批評係非常之膚淺 我覺得

1560
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
咁最後

1561
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
就有個問題就係佢問啦 如果你搵上帝解釋啲嘢

1562
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
你搵乜嘢解釋上帝呢

1563
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
似乎都有一樣嘢解釋唔到喎

1564
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
既然係咁 不如更加經濟

1565
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
唔要上帝咪算囉 咁這次

1566
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
世界存在咪得囉

1567
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
咁但係呢度呢就有一樣

1568
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
就我有兩方面回答 第一就係話呢

1569
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
就其實上帝本身有啲屬性呢

1570
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
同一個有限嘅宇宙唔同 因為有限嘅宇宙

1571
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
咁獨特咁奇怪咁精密

1572
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
亦都係會自然地

1573
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
raise好多問題 都有個起點等等

1574
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
亦都人類嘅價值都自然

1575
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
提到一個嘅基礎問題

1576
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
咁上帝屬性本身唔同

1577
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
佢係自有永有嘅 佢係一種嘅

1578
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
好強嘅簡潔性呢個streamer就係提出嘅

1579
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
佢係一種嘅

1580
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
完美 既然完美

1581
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
我哋可以問人嘅價值再搵一個更加

1582
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
完美基礎去支持 如果完美者本身

1583
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
我哋唔需要再搵一個更加高嘅價值基礎

1584
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
所以係嗰度呢個係一個

1585
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
natural嘅terminus

1586
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
呢個第一點

1587
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
第二就話其實呢

1588
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
依度係我根據streamer就提到一個例子

1589
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
其實呢好多人就話你搵上帝解釋

1590
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
咁上帝點解釋呢

1591
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
我哋話我唔知上帝點解釋

1592
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
咁上帝唔需要解釋咁又點呢

1593
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
佢好似就話上帝解釋唔到 所以你唔能用上帝解釋其他嘢

1594
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
喺呢個批評當中

1595
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
已經假設咗呢

1596
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
當你提出A去解釋

1597
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
當你提出B去解釋A嘅時候

1598
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
你一定要搵到C去解釋B

1599
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
先得嘅

1600
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
咁但係依個邏輯咁C又要搵個D

1601
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
D又要搵個E咁就無窮

1602
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
後退囉

1603
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
但事實上喺我哋嘅科學或者探索裏面呢

1604
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
我哋好多時候我哋就盡量

1605
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
搵到一個合理嘅

1606
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
個階段我哋都未必要求

1607
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
都一定能解釋到嘅

1608
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
例如你發覺你人包唔記得錢

1609
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
你話有個小偷咗

1610
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
點解小偷會偷你錢呢你點解釋

1611
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
你都唔知道小偷係邊度

1612
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
你都唔知道有咩動機

1613
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
咁所以其實好多嘢呢

1614
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
譬如科學咁樣你用

1615
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
夸克去解釋而家物理結構

1616
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
咁但係夸克又點解釋呢咁樣

1617
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
你未諗到之前

1618
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
唔係代表夸克就唔存在嘅或者

1619
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
夸克嘅存在就唔合理㗎嘛

1620
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
所以科學嘅理論都係

1621
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
不斷嘅push去搵一個

1622
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
能夠將我哋嘅經驗連貫提供一個

1623
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
最economical嘅

1624
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
explanation呢點就唔係

1625
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
我係搭埋Shrimbrone嗰啲嘅

1626
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
就更加比佢有啲更加完整嘅

1627
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
科學方向論嗰個討論就更加好

1628
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
咁但係所以基本上

1629
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Mackey嘅回應都可以係

1630
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
都可以回應到嘅

1631
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
總結嚟講呢我都係欣賞Hanskrum嗰個進度啦

1632
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
同埋我自己

1633
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
嗰個批評其實有幾方便第一就係

1634
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
我反而覺得佢個自然承諾唔夠強

1635
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
咁其實呢

1636
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
當代裏面其實好多嘅論證呢

1637
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
都有好多新嘅

1638
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
分析哋其實都唔係好似Mackey咁嘅

1639
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
都有好多好勁好嚴謹嘅人呢

1640
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
將佢仔細嘅嚴謹論證

1641
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
所以大家就睇呢

1642
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
就係第十頁

1643
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
下面嘅Full Note 而家就講Full Note

1644
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
咁我呢就係

1645
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
一本書面就介紹咗

1646
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
當代英美嘅承諾

1647
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
自然承諾嘅發展

1648
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
好多都係reviate返自然承諾嘅

1649
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
跟住大家睇第十一版

1650
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
有半頁Full Note

1651
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
咁嗰個呢

1652
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
就係大家睇第三點呢就係講到呢

1653
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
好多人提出呢就話呢

1654
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
其實係可以用綜合好多論證

1655
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
上帝能夠未必有兩件事

1656
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
能夠證明上帝存在但呢綜合來講呢

1657
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
就係我解釋宇宙嘅起源

1658
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
我哋價值觀嘅基礎人生嘅意義

1659
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
心靈嘅出現

1660
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
so and so forth

1661
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
咁樣

1662
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
所以係個綜合性嘅論證呢類似嘅論證呢

1663
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
先顯示出上帝嘅存在嘅合理性嘅

1664
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
就唔係一兩點嘅

1665
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
咁係當中第三點呢就係個Mephothology

1666
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
呢就巴蘇米奇奧本書呢就係

1667
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
帶出咗啦另外呢

1668
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
呢個我自己牛津嘅老師Richard Springburn呢

1669
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
好似再最近會出一本第三版嘅

1670
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Existence of God

1671
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
同埋呢個Petri Forest

1672
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
都係用呢個方法去論證上帝嘅存在

1673
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
咁另外一樣嘅呢我覺得呢就係

1674
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Hans Goon呢就

1675
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
接受你認為生命嘅起源呢

1676
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
科學解釋曬㗎啦

1677
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
唔需要有咩其他因素

1678
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
但按住我自己嘅研究就唔係咁同意

1679
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
我覺得進化論

1680
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
可能啱啱都未定但係

1681
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
按我自己而家嘅理解呢

1682
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
從科學證據嚟講進化論呢

1683
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
特別生命起源嗰度呢係充滿著

1684
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
即係好多嘅流動

1685
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
而生命本身個複雜性

1686
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
我懷疑呢可能係

1687
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
宇宙有限嘅時鐘裏面可能根本

1688
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
係出現唔到而我都嘗試睇過

1689
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
進化論者好多嘗試

1690
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
只不過係無數一樣再加上一樣嘅

1691
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
假設同埋呢揣測

1692
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
咁所以從返一個設計嘅精密

1693
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
角度嚟講呢其實呢我自己覺得

1694
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
係有一個好強嘅起碼係一個

1695
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
強嘅case呢佢argue呢其實

1696
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
無神論者都唔能夠充分解釋

1697
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
生命嘅出現

1698
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
嘅現象咁特別係近年裏面呢

1699
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
第一個好強嘅係

1700
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
係美國呢有嘅intelligent

1701
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
design movement咁我

1702
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
第四個寬度嗰度呢就講到譬如話

1703
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Demsky呀

1704
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Michael Behear Philip Johnson

1705
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
嘅書呢我都唔大詳細個個講呀

1706
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
我先度話比大家聽呢

1707
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
我自己覺得呢個school嘅都有啲好強嘅

1708
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
思想呢可以正面挑戰返

1709
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
無神論嘅進化論

1710
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
跟住呢第六點

1711
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
第五點呢

1712
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
其實呢喺宇宙論證同埋設計論證

1713
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
都有好多新嘅更新

1714
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
特別呢係嗰個

1715
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
將兩岸結合埋一齊

1716
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
宇宙嘅秩序同埋好多宇宙嘅定律

1717
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
好多嘅微調

1718
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
即係話佢係好精密嘅配合

1719
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
以至於生命能夠出現好多嘅嘢

1720
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
都顯示宇宙唔係

1721
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
盲目嘅撞出嚟嘅

1722
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
咁我自己都係有一定程度

1723
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
嘅去講呢個設計論證嘅

1724
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
另外呢第六點

1725
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
第六個歡樂

1726
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
最講究宇宙嘅起點呀

1727
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
喺康松嘅日本書面都講過大爆炸問題

1728
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
康松嘅進度呢就盡量將科學

1729
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
同埋呢宗教係分隔

1730
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
嚟講嘅

1731
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
佢認為呢大爆炸啱同唔啱

1732
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
同創造論冇乜關係

1733
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
因為創造論就係講無論世界點嚟都好

1734
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
創造每時每刻都係源自於

1735
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
一個終極嘅因

1736
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
就係上帝

1737
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
要喺2800年前

1738
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
點爆個宇宙就興起

1739
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
我覺得康松咁講都

1740
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
都啱,創造論唔係

1741
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
一定要依賴一個時間起點

1742
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
但我轉頭講就係如果時間起點

1743
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
自然主義對宇宙嘅解釋

1744
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
就並唔係咁好

1745
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
點解個宇宙就能夠無啦啦爆出嚟

1746
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
爆到咁精密,無能夠適合人嘅生存呢

1747
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
所以我覺得呢個係非常

1748
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
巧合,如果配合呢一點呢

1749
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
更加帶出巧合

1750
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
總有可能會存在

1751
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
無上論者都唔能完全否定

1752
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
咁但係我哋可以更加睇到

1753
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
如果將整個宇宙人類嘅出現

1754
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
視為一個完全由虛無

1755
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
爆出嚟嘅大巧合

1756
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
就更加顯示出康松所講

1757
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
點嘅就係無上論係一個

1758
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
完全無理由嘅

1759
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
賦予實在一個基礎

1760
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
但有上論卻能夠為一切提到

1761
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
一個穩固嘅基礎

1762
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
咁另外第七點就講到個道德論證

1763
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
我只覺得呢,康松好強調道德

1764
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
教育需要個超越基礎呢

1765
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
係一個同意嘅講法嘅

1766
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
咁我近年呢幾年寫六篇文章,大家睇睇

1767
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
歡樂七,咁呢呢度呢

1768
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
當然英文書都好多嘅

1769
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
不過呢六篇文章呢,裏面都有好多歡樂

1770
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
你都講到英文書嘅,邊度

1771
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
大家有興趣都可以找嚟睇下

1772
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
咁另外就好多論證呢

1773
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
就唔逐個講呀,咁所以你

1774
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
就係呢度呢,就想講講就

1775
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
就講兩點呀,就係

1776
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
中國人科學嘅關係呀,康松坐咗一個分隔雪

1777
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
盡量分開,咁呢個

1778
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
對有啲人都有幫助,但我只覺得其實呢

1779
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
可以更加強,將中國人科學嘅結果呢

1780
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
我只覺得呢個世界上嘅創造

1781
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
呢個科學嘅發現

1782
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
唔會同信仰矛盾嘅,所以可以

1783
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
更加正面嘅結合

1784
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
第二點

1785
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
康松呢,作為天下神學家呢

1786
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
其實呢都唔算係

1787
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
即係點樣好極端嘅啦

1788
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
咁但係某啲事上面都同我哋一般嘅

1789
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
環教會嘅方塊信仰呢

1790
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
即係部分嘅環教會嘅方塊信仰呢

1791
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
就唔係一樣嘅

1792
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
譬如佢又傾向下啲報告論呀

1793
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
三位一睇

1794
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
我睇完之後我都懷疑佢

1795
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
成唔成靈呢,係獨立嘅位格

1796
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
但係佢呢啲事通常呢

1797
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
左我講右我講下,講完之後你都唔知

1798
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
佢真正嘅立場係點㗎

1799
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
即係佢一方面又唔想太極端,但另一方面呢

1800
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
又唔想commit太過傳統嘅立場

1801
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
咁基督論呢,我睇完睇下呢

1802
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
一方面佢就話,佢又可以

1803
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
同離世又信經一齊講

1804
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
即係我信聖,呢個聖子係

1805
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
God from God, Light from Light

1806
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
但我睇完睇下,我都覺得佢係一個

1807
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Adoptionism,即係一個叫

1808
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
即係其實基督自己係一個人,不過呢

1809
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
上帝就將呢個人呢

1810
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
就特別係照顧

1811
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
即係我地叫Adoptionist嘅

1812
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Christology,然後呢就將佢

1813
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
變成一個完全嘅

1814
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
啟示,所以呢基督

1815
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
同神嗰個嘅關係呢

1816
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
只不過係一個啟示上面嘅

1817
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
嘅完全嘅符合吻合

1818
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
唔係一個本體上面嘅

1819
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
吻合,我自己

1820
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
個人嚟講就比較傾向一個

1821
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
經典嘅,加西敦嘅

1822
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
即係一個嘅基督論

1823
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
上帝,即係基督係

1824
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
聖子,即係永恆

1825
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
存在嘅聖子,Eternal

1826
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Logos,係杜申玉,佢又Sroom咗

1827
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Humanity,但係呢啲好複雜

1828
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
上嘅問題唔得詳細講,不過我類似想講呢

1829
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
我唔同以香Sroom呢,但係我

1830
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
認為Foreign派應該用一個Ironic,同埋Open

1831
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Minder嘅態度去講,即係

1832
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
好多時候呢,Foreign派對一啲唔同嘅信仰就

1833
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
一見到緊張,唔准睇唔准睇

1834
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
唔好睇啦,呢本書就邪嘢,跟住係度尖叫

1835
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
你二端嚟嘅,自由派嚟㗎,咁樣

1836
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
如果我做學者咁樣,我就讀唔到幾本書

1837
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
因為本本書都有自由派,差不多

1838
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
我讀嗰啲

1839
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
好緊要㗎,係我嚟講,其實

1840
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
自由派唔自由派,我常常老師都好多

1841
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
自由派,有啲比方派

1842
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
咩派都有,我讀嘅書

1843
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
乜派都有,邪派都有

1844
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
好傳統嘅派都有

1845
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
反而我覺得返嚟嗰啲比較自由派

1846
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
對文化,對好多問題

1847
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
更加誠實,更加豐富反省

1848
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
其實,福音派成日就為咗守住

1849
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
嗰個正統,好合宅,咩都唔諗

1850
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
所以我越睇越悶,有某啲

1851
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
好福音派,Erickson,Gudin

1852
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
睇完都

1853
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
有少少悶嘅感覺

1854
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
雖然講嘢都好似好啱

1855
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
咁但係呢

1856
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
所以我嚟講,我返嚟

1857
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
鍾意讀Hansung咁解,睇完之後好豐富思想

1858
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
但係我唔係同意曬佢思想

1859
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
但我哋可以用一個Irene Hattel之類嘅思想

1860
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
第一我想指出,好多其實

1861
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
佢嗰啲基督論,其實同佢整本書

1862
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
冇乜關係嘅

1863
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
即係話,你可以adopt佢前面argument

1864
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
而唔需要接受佢後面個基督論

1865
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
咁呢就

1866
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
亦都可以呢,係其他方面

1867
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
我都覺得其實,佢整個論據呢

1868
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
就其實,同佢個神學嗰個呢

1869
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
具體嘅信念呢

1870
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
其實佢係justify一個基本上

1871
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
physics嘅world view

1872
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
但係基督神學裏面嘅論據呢

1873
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
我哋可以用一個平靜嘅心

1874
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
我哋可以話俾人睇,我哋

1875
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
解釋點解佢哋個立場

1876
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
咁至於有其他人有唔同意嘅

1877
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
其實我哋都唔需要太緊張

1878
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
咁我哋都欣賞佢哋個優點

1879
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
咁但我哋都要呢,都要去

1880
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
問返我自己信仰嗰個原由

1881
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
咁所以呢度就另一個課題就唔得

1882
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
係呢度就詳細講,今日呢

1883
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
就講到呢度,我其實開場白已經講咗啦

1884
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
所以今日就講到呢度

1885
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
好多謝大家

1886
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
咁我哋就講到呢度

1887
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
咁我哋就講到呢度

1888
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
咁我哋就講到呢度

1889
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
咁我哋就講到呢度

1890
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
咁我哋就講到呢度

1891
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
咁我哋就講到呢度

1892
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
咁我哋就講到呢度

1893
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
咁我哋就講到呢度
