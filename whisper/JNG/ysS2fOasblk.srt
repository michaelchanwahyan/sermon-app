1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
講題呢,就係關於突破人生嘅十種祈求

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,320
我哋今日講第三講

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,320
本來我定嘅題目就係懂得選擇

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
但係今日我發覺呢四個字更加準確

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,600
就係選擇正確

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,520
我哋學習點樣喺我哋人生裏面容易啲

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,400
或者話唔好出錯

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,400
唔知大家係咪一個識得揀嘅人呢?

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,400
你揀得最啱嘅事情會係咩呢?

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,000
或者話你人生最後悔揀咗啲乜嘢呢?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
我哋好多時有句俗語

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
或者成日講嘅就係千揀萬斬

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,200
揀著個藍燈盞

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,800
我識有啲朋友呢係有選擇恐懼症嘅

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
佢話最好唔好畀我揀

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,200
得喇得喇得喇你話事得喇

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
譬如去到餐廳咁樣俾個餐牌佢

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,400
嘩大件事啦

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
我識嘅最耐呢好似係15分鐘20分鐘呢

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
都未揀到嘢食嘅

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,200
我覺得佢好似幾乎想背咗個餐牌咁樣

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
揀唔到

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
揀錯食物呢

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
最多都係後悔兩三個鐘

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
因為可能你下晝揀錯咗

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,200
咁夜晚咪再揀過囉

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,800
咁有啲嘢揀錯咗呢

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
我哋會話好嚴重嘅

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
係抱憾

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,200
咩呀?

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,600
終生

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,000
但抱憾終生原來唔係最嚴重嘅

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
最嚴重係咩呀?

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
係抱憾永生

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
係個永遠

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,800
你都提到自己原來我做錯咗呢個決定呢

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,600
大件事

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
今日我哋從耶穌講嘅一個比喻

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
嚟去學習點樣選擇正確

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,600
頭先講嗰個比喻

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,000
大家睇咗上半節

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,200
好多人好喜歡睇呢個比喻

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
因為好似畀到我哋有好多思想嘅空間

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
佢仲揭示咗

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
一啲我哋好想知道嘅嘢

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,600
因為講到人呢個世界

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
亦都講到人離開咗呢個世界

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400
我哋將會去到一個永遠嘅福樂

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
就係天家

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
又講到

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,800
如果你去到地獄嘅時候

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
會有啲咩嘅景況

53
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,000
如果拍呢齣戲

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,800
我相信應該都會幾好睇

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,000
因為有唔同嘅場景

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,600
但當你一路去睇呢個比喻嘅時候

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
希望你唔好有一個結論

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,600
就係話

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
哦

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
咁即係話貧窮嗰啲

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
即係話在世

62
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
係咁畀人蝦嗰啲

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
將來

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
上帝就會俾返應得嘅嘢嚟

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
可能啱

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
但係另一個應該就唔啱啦

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,200
就係話

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,800
哦

69
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,200
有錢嗰啲

70
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
你就慘啦

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
呢個

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
肯定唔係我哋嘅結論

73
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
因為有錢

74
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
講得白啲

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
唔係罪呀

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
咁究竟點解耶穌講呢個比喻

77
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
究竟想同我哋講啲乜呢

78
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
喺路教福音十六章十九節

79
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,600
開始呢個比喻嘅時候

80
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,400
佢有一個財主

81
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
穿著紫色嘅袍

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
同細麻衣服

83
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,400
天天奢華

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,800
現落財主嗰件紫色嘅袍

85
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,000
係講到佢嘅外衣

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
咁呢就係身份嘅象徵

87
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,200
細麻布衣服就係講到裏面嘅襯衫

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,200
原來研究返當時耶穌嘅時代

89
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,000
我哋而家可能話最貴價嗰啲衫

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
可能係法國

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
跟住唔知咩大嘅設計師設計

92
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
就覺得係身份嘅象徵

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
原來當時嘅身份嘅象徵

94
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
係喺邊個國家引入呢

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
係埃及

96
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,400
原來埃及入嘅細麻衣嘅布料

97
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
係嗰時最名貴嘅

98
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,800
咁聖經亦都話佢天天奢華現落

99
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
佢似乎唔使做嘢

100
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
但係當然佢係奢華

101
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,000
即係話好浪費

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
呢個係財主

103
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
耶穌咁樣描述

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
冇明智嘅

105
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,800
但係另一個有明智嘅人出現

106
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,600
佢又有一個土範嘅

107
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
即係一個乞丐

108
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
名叫拉撒盧

109
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
渾身生瘡

110
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
被人放喺財主嘅門口

111
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
我哋記住

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
放呢個字

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
拉撒盧嘅意思

114
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,000
原來當時嘅意思就係講神嘅幫助

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,600
可能佢一生就係想得到上帝嘅幫助

116
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
所以佢改咗

117
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
拉撒盧呢個名

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
而佢渾身生瘡

119
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
係當時嘅環境相信都會好差

120
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,600
所以渾身生瘡之餘

121
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
冇人理佢

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
我嗰個年代

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
衛生都差嘅

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
而其中一樣點樣見到呢

125
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
就係我哋返學嘅時候

126
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
好驚會染咗嗰種

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
因為衛生環境差而有嘅一種病

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
嗰個咩病呀?係啦

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
只好講得啱

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
就係頭塞

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
因為無端端有一日返學

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
跟住見到個同學仔

133
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,800
咦?

134
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
做乜你冇晒頭髮嘅?

135
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,600
或者見到一個本來長頭髮嘅女孩子

136
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,200
咦?

137
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
剪到好短喎

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
咁嗰時我哋好驚呢啲

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,200
咁而下半節佢話

140
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,000
拉撒盧被人放喺財主嘅門口

141
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
點解會係放喺呢?

142
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
相信佢係行動不便

143
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
咁所以係被動地

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
俾人放喺門口

145
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
佢做啲咩呢?

146
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
21節裏面講

147
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
原來佢要得財主

148
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,000
喺桌上面

149
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,800
吊下嚟嘅零碎沖機

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
原來佢要靠咁樣

151
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
嚟到食嘢

152
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
但係原來聖經嘅原文呢

153
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
希臘文呢

154
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,000
係冇零碎呢兩個字嘅

155
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
原來只係話

156
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
等佢吊落嚟嘅食物沖機

157
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
咁等咩食物呢?

158
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,400
原來當時耶穌時代

159
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
佢哋食飯嘅習慣

160
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,800
係咁樣嘅

161
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
用一張長長地

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,800
好矮嘅好似茶几咁嘅枱

163
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
然之後佢哋

164
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
會側身

165
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,200
坐喺度

166
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,800
或者呆喺度

167
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
嚟到食嘢

168
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
咁而佢哋食嘢

169
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
如果係有錢人有一個習慣

170
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
就係佢哋有肉食

171
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
當然有肉汁

172
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
好似聖經咁講

173
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
然之後呢

174
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
佢哋會食一啲大嘅麵包

175
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
佢哋就搵啲麵包

176
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
點啲肉汁

177
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,400
然之後食

178
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
食剩嘅

179
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,800
丟

180
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,400
而另一方面

181
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,000
佢哋食完隻手污糟咗

182
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,800
你估用咩抹手呢?

183
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,600
原來用返麵包嚟到抹手

184
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,800
我唔知嗰兩個字崇拜出唔出得街

185
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
但係唔講喇我都係

186
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
吓?

187
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
好似好

188
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
好嚴重吖嘛

189
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
你估現實生活會唔會有人咁呀?

190
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
我讀中三嘅時候

191
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
我有一日同啲同學仔

192
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
因為有幾個係

193
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
而家講嘅俗語

194
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,800
就係話富二代啦

195
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
中學佢都揸車花學

196
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
跟住其中有一個

197
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,000
佢點呢?

198
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
我哋一齊去茶餐廳食嘢

199
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
咁咪有個餐啦

200
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,400
有個公仔麵咁樣

201
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
有個蛋

202
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
蛋有個腸仔

203
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
有個包

204
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
佢用個包嚟做咩呢?

205
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
唔係抹手

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
係抹刀同埋抹叉

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
原來真係

208
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,600
現實中有人係咁浪費

209
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
拉殺路就係等嗰啲抹手

210
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
掉咗嘅麵包

211
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,000
但聖經話都等唔到

212
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,200
都冇

213
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,000
後嚟

214
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
拿土飯嘅

215
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,000
死咗啦

216
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
易哲話

217
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,400
被天使帶去放喺阿伯拉罕嘅懷裏面

218
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
我唔知你係咪即刻

219
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
有少少疑惑

220
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
拉殺路又唔係小朋友

221
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
點樣可以擺喺阿伯拉罕

222
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
嘅懷裏面呢?

223
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
原來聖經學者話

224
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
就係頭先我講佢哋食飯嘅習慣

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
就係半嗌喺度

226
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,400
原來當時嘅習俗

227
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,200
如果邊一個係嗰個主人

228
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,600
最高貴嘅賓客

229
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,400
佢會坐喺佢嘅右手邊

230
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,000
咁原來當兩個一齊

231
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
打側

232
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,200
坐喺度嘅時候

233
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
真係有啲似

234
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,200
你望入去

235
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,000
喺佢嘅懷裏面食飯咁樣

236
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
咁佢哋半嗌半耳咁

237
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
喺度食飯

238
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
原來當呢個拉殺路

239
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,400
生前縱使係幾淒涼

240
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
但係上帝安慰返佢

241
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,000
佢放喺阿伯拉罕嘅懷裏面

242
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
喺天家裏面

243
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,200
廿四節咁樣講

244
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
咁個財主都離開咗世界

245
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
佢就大喊住話

246
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
我祖阿伯拉罕

247
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
呢個財主講

248
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
可憐我爸

249
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,400
打發拉殺路

250
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
搵啲水

251
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,800
就嚟點一點我

252
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,400
因為呢

253
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
可以涼一涼我舌頭

254
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
因為我嘅

255
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,000
我喺呢度嘅火焰裏面

256
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
極其痛苦

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,800
跟住講

258
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,200
阿伯拉罕話

259
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
你該回想你生前享過福

260
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
拉殺路也受過苦

261
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
如今他在這裡得安慰

262
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
你都受痛苦

263
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,400
不但這樣

264
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,000
並且在你我之間有深淵限定

265
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
以致人要從這邊過到你門那邊是不能的

266
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
要從那邊過到我門這邊

267
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
都是不能的

268
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
跟住財主話

269
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,600
我祖阿伯拉罕

270
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,800
既係這樣求你打發拉殺路到我父家裏

271
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
因為我還有五個弟兄

272
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,400
他可以對他們作見證

273
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,000
免得他們來到我這痛苦嘅地方

274
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
阿伯拉罕回應財主話

275
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,000
他們有摩西同先知嘅話可以聽從

276
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
他說

277
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
我祖阿伯拉罕

278
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
唔係嘅

279
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
如果有一個從死裏復活到佢哋哪裏去

280
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
佢哋就會悔改

281
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
阿伯拉罕話

282
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
若不聽從摩西同先知嘅話

283
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,200
就係有一個從死裏復活嘅

284
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
佢哋也是不聽

285
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,800
原來呢度出現咗一個好強烈嘅對比

286
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,000
就係財主同拉殺路嘅生前死後

287
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
財主生前享盡奢華

288
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,800
死後卻痛苦難受

289
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,000
財主生前享盡美食

290
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,800
死後卻要搵水都無

291
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,200
拉殺路生前混身生瘡

292
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
但財主死後

293
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
佢嘅痛苦

294
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,400
相信係比佢嚴重百倍

295
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
因為佢生喺火焰裏面

296
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,200
拉殺路生前喺財主門口討飯

297
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,800
佢死後喺阿伯拉罕嘅懷裏面

298
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
拉殺路生前

299
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
只係要吊出嚟嘅麵包

300
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,400
但係

301
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
財主死後

302
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
一啲水都無

303
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
呢個比喻

304
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
當時耶穌講

305
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,000
最震撼嘅人

306
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,800
係一班猶太人

307
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,400
因為猶太人一路佢對於

308
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,800
生前死後唔係咁理解

309
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
佢對於金錢都唔係咁理解

310
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,600
佢哋點理解金錢呢

311
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
原來佢哋就係覺得

312
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
財主即係有錢人

313
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
就係等於二人

314
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
係受上帝嘅祝福

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
所以佢今世先有咁多金錢可以享用

316
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
而拉殺路一定係犯咗罪人

317
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
所以聖經你都話

318
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,200
見到人哋咁嚴重嘅災難

319
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,800
你都可能嗰陣時啲人都會諗

320
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,000
究竟佢做錯咗啲乜嘢

321
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
呢個比喻揭示到

322
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,000
地獄同埋天堂

323
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
頭先我講過整個比喻

324
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,800
肯定唔係話有錢

325
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
入唔到天國

326
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
咁但係究竟係咩原因呢

327
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
我哋再睇返呢幾節嘅聖經

328
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
喺廿六節

329
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,000
佢話有深淵

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
如果你睇到第二行

331
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
有深淵嘅限定

332
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
以至到原來喺天國

333
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
同埋喺地獄

334
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,400
佢哋唔可以隨便往來

335
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
而去到廿七廿八節

336
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,600
財主諗起佢仲有再生嘅五個兄弟

337
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,700
我相信即係話

338
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,000
可能嗰五個兄弟

339
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,200
同佢再生嘅時候都係一樣咁樣

340
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
奢華賢樂

341
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,800
佢好想阿拉罕去搵人

342
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
去提下佢要快啲悔改

343
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,000
廿九節阿拉罕好清楚講

344
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
佢哋已經有好多人

345
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
有摩西有先知同佢哋嘅話

346
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
佢哋可以聽

347
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,800
然之後財主仲堅持

348
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
佢話唔係阿拉罕

349
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
如果有一個喺死裏面復活

350
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,000
去到佢哋嗰度嘅人

351
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,600
佢哋就會悔改

352
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
阿拉罕話就算從死裏復活

353
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,000
亦都唔會悔改

354
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
究竟我哋而家有咩嘅選擇呢

355
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,800
有時我哋揀錯咗啲嘢

356
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
可以揀過

357
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
但有時可能冇機會

358
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,600
好似財主一樣

359
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,800
頭先好集中講人有神蹟

360
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
係咪就會悔改呢

361
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,600
你有冇試過傳福音呢

362
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,400
同啲人講話

363
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,000
不如你信耶穌啦咁樣

364
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,600
既然冇耶穌嘅冇上帝嘅

365
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
如果有神蹟呢

366
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
我就會悔改啦

367
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
你估係咪呢

368
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
其實上帝好多時都發生咗好多神蹟

369
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
唔信嘅人會點解釋

370
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800
咁巧啫

371
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,400
或者有時真係好大嘅神蹟

372
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,800
可能醫生已經宣布話

373
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,200
嗰個絕症可能好快已經唔得㗎啦

374
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
咁結果

375
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,200
真係醫得好

376
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,600
跟住又會有啲人就話

377
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,200
哦

378
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,000
呢個呢

379
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,800
係係係

380
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
雖然科學解釋唔到

381
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,800
但係呢就可能有好多好多好多原因

382
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
又話可能人嘅意志力

383
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,800
又去嘗試解釋

384
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
耶穌

385
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
都行過好多神蹟

386
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,800
佢曾經都去醫治一個

387
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
已經死咗四日

388
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,400
馬大馬尼亞嘅兄弟

389
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
咁好多人見到

390
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
係咪好多人信晒耶穌呢

391
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
原來唔係

392
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,000
更加加劇

393
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,800
佢哋要除滅耶穌

394
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
所以原來真係

395
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
唔係

396
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
一有神蹟

397
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,200
人哋就相信耶穌

398
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
今日唔特別講

399
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,400
我哋應該點樣去選擇耶穌

400
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
但好想講頭先我話

401
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,400
抱憾永生

402
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,800
財主好明顯揀錯咗啲嘢

403
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,400
佢抱憾永生

404
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,000
但係原來喺現實生活裏面

405
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
或者話

406
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
以前有一個好出名嘅悲劇

407
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,200
喺1808年

408
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
1808年有個悲劇

409
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,400
叫做咩名呢

410
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,600
叫做浮士德

411
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,400
大家聽過佢個名啦

412
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
原來就係講浮士德

413
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,000
係一個當時好叻嘅人

414
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
天文地理哲學

415
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
所有嘢都好叻嘅

416
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,400
但佢就係唔開心

417
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,200
佢會覺得

418
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
哎呀我回顧返我呢一生

419
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
雖然我好叻

420
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,800
但我享受唔到

421
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,600
呢個世界有嘅福樂

422
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
結果佢竟然間

423
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,600
做咗一宗交易

424
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
佢同魔鬼

425
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,200
佢竟然間搵魔鬼去做交易

426
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
佢話

427
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
如果你能夠令到我

428
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,400
可以享受我嘅餘生

429
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
如果你能夠我

430
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
可以喺我有限嘅生命

431
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
我可以開心得到嘅話

432
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,000
我同你做一宗交易

433
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,800
就係當我死咗之後

434
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,600
我嘅靈魂交畀你

435
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
嘩

436
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
聽話好似好蠢

437
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,000
人嘅生命匆匆幾十年咁短暫

438
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,200
你用將來永遠嘅生命

439
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,800
去同個魔鬼交易

440
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
結果魔鬼帶佢去

441
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,200
睇盡榮華富貴

442
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
仲令到佢同一個

443
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,000
少女係戀愛

444
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
結果佢死後

445
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
當然要履行佢嘅諾言

446
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,400
佢抱憾永生

447
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
現實裏面

448
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
其實都有好多人

449
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
選擇同魔鬼去交易

450
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
我相信一啲

451
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,200
製毒品嘅人

452
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
一啲令人去吸毒嘅人

453
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
佢令到好多人

454
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
家破人亡嘅人

455
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,600
佢為咗享受今世嘅錢

456
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
為咗享受今世嘅福樂

457
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,800
佢情願同魔鬼去交換

458
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
聖經話

459
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,200
無要謹守警醒

460
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,200
因為你們嘅仇敵魔鬼

461
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
如同尻叫嘅獅子

462
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200
遍地遊行

463
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,400
尋找可吞嚇嘅人

464
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,200
魔鬼最想吞嚇係邊一個呢?

465
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
喺二千幾年前

466
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
有個人

467
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
佢係最想吞嚇嘅

468
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,200
呢個人就係耶穌

469
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
當有一日

470
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
耶穌受咗浸

471
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
當耶穌受浸嘅時候

472
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
聖經記載

473
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,200
天忽然為佢開咗

474
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,000
我相信即係話好光明

475
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
然之後佢就睇見

476
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,000
神嘅靈彷彿夾子一樣

477
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
降到耶穌嘅身上

478
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,800
其實仲有一句說話

479
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
係上帝講

480
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,200
話呢個係我嘅愛子

481
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,800
我所喜悅嘅

482
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,600
有啲人就話

483
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,200
呢個可能係耶穌

484
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,600
最榮耀嘅時候

485
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
因為佢受浸嘅時候

486
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
肯定有其他人見到

487
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
而當佢受浸上返嚟

488
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
話個天為佢打開

489
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,400
上帝話呢個係我嘅愛子

490
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
但鏡頭一轉

491
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
有一個浸禮嘅地方

492
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
有一個好光嘅地方

493
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
有一個由上帝

494
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,000
有聲音臨到嘅地方

495
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,200
轉到去抗野

496
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,800
一個四野無人嘅抗野

497
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,000
佢仲要係禁食咗四十晝夜

498
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,600
相信因為耶穌

499
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
都係一個血肉之軀

500
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,600
佢呢個時候好肚餓

501
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
但聖經就記載

502
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
佢肚餓之後

503
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,600
魔鬼就嚟試探耶穌

504
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
想吞嚇耶穌

505
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,000
魔鬼用咗三個伎倆

506
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
我想大家記住呢三個伎倆

507
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,000
原來魔鬼一路咁多年

508
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,800
要去試探一個人

509
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
要去令到一個人犯罪

510
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
都係未必

511
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,000
都係唔會離開呢三個伎倆

512
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
第一個魔鬼講

513
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,600
如果你是神嘅兒子

514
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
可以吩咐呢個石頭

515
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
變為食物

516
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,400
當時耶穌最肚餓嘅時候

517
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
將個石頭變食物

518
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,600
但耶穌話

519
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,800
經常記著說

520
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,200
人活著不是單靠食物

521
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,400
乃是靠神口裡

522
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
所出嘅一切話

523
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
我重複一次

524
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
人活著不是單靠食物

525
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
乃是靠神口裡

526
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,200
所出嘅一切話

527
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
當第一招唔得

528
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
魔鬼再用第二招

529
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
你若是神嘅兒子

530
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
可以跳落嚟

531
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
點解話佢跳落嚟呢

532
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
原來魔鬼嗰時帶咗耶穌去到聖城

533
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,800
聖殿嘅殿頂

534
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,400
去到殿頂

535
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
然之後同佢講呢句說話

536
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
因為經常記著說

537
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,600
魔鬼幾狡猾

538
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
佢引用返聖經

539
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
你講聖經

540
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,800
我就同你講聖經

541
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
因為經常記著說

542
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,600
主要為你吩咐佢嘅使者

543
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,200
用手托著你

544
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
免得你嘅腳

545
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,800
碰在地上

546
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,600
碰在石頭上

547
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
因為乜嘢

548
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,800
因為啱啱

549
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
先宣佈完

550
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,800
四十日之前

551
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,200
你係上帝嘅外子

552
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
你要跳落嚟

553
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
一定有神蹟

554
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
俾人睇到㗎

555
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
如果有人見到呢個神蹟

556
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,200
咪仲多人信你

557
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
仲多人信你

558
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,400
結果

559
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
耶穌都係話

560
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
經常記著說

561
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
不可

562
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
試探

563
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
主

564
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
你嘅神

565
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
第二招

566
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
又唔得

567
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
都係三招

568
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
你若腐敗我

569
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,200
點解又咁講呢魔鬼

570
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
原來佢帶耶穌離開咗個墊頂之後

571
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
去到最高嘅山

572
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,400
聖經話

573
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,600
佢帶耶穌睇盡萬國同埋萬國嘅榮華

574
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,800
即係話

575
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,200
佢話你拜完之後

576
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,000
將一切都畀你

577
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,800
耶穌話

578
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,000
沙丹

579
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,200
退去吧

580
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
因為經常記著說

581
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
當拜主你嘅神

582
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
但要侍奉佢

583
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
大家唔會留意

584
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
耶穌去抵擋個罪惡

585
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
耶穌去抵擋魔鬼

586
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
耶穌係得一招

587
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,600
但呢一招係永遠都得

588
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
就係用咩

589
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
用返聖經

590
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
耶穌

591
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
當然佢唔係睇新約聖經

592
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,000
係睇舊約

593
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
摩世唔敬

594
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
原來佢一路去同上帝有一個好好嘅關係

595
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
好嘅裝備

596
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
以至到當魔鬼視探臨到嘅時候

597
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
佢識得回應

598
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
但魔鬼真係好狡猾

599
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,800
佢用晒耶穌嘅肉身嘅需要

600
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,000
我哋有時見到啲人犯咗罪

601
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
佢話 哎呀 做咩你偷嗰啲嘢食呀

602
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,400
有一句嘢好似好合理嘅

603
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
有得食唔食呀

604
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
有得食就要食㗎

605
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
有啲人對於犯罪嘅人

606
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,400
跟住會幫自己解釋

607
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,600
哎呀 邊有貓唔食魚㗎

608
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,400
有貓唔食魚喎

609
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
同埋你當自己係貓呀

610
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,600
係咪

611
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
你係萬物之靈

612
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
你將自己鋼格到變咗做貓

613
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,800
而為自己有個藉口

614
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,400
就係有得食

615
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,000
你就唔食

616
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
食物

617
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,200
第二個

618
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,000
去到電頂

619
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
跳落嚟

620
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
我哋有時好多時

621
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,000
我哋係追求神蹟嘅

622
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,600
我哋好想

623
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,200
哇 如果我哋有啲呢

624
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,600
好特別嘅經歷呢

625
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
就可以榮耀神呀

626
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
其實你諗返

627
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,800
你係真係想榮耀上帝

628
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
淨係顯示畀人睇

629
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,200
你好叻呢

630
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
然之後

631
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,600
就係萬國嘅榮華

632
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,800
我相信

633
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
呢個

634
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,400
都係令到好多弟兄姊妹跌倒

635
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
就係過唔到嗰個金錢

636
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,000
呢個最實際呀

637
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
好多人利用

638
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,600
好多人

639
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,800
我哋睇埋好多戲

640
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,600
原來真嘅

641
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
唔係淨係睇戲

642
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
嗰啲嘅大老闆

643
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
先至帶你去一個

644
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,000
嘩 好高級嘅餐廳

645
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
好多紅酒

646
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,800
然之後呢

647
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,600
就去說服你去做某啲嘢

648
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
其實咪就係咁樣

649
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
嚟到去

650
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,400
利用

651
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
係咪呀

652
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
最近唔知點解

653
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,800
香港同埋溫哥華

654
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,600
都好多人討論

655
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,800
一出講法律嘅戲

656
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,200
係咪

657
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
唔係就係成日都係做

658
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
來來去去

659
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,600
就係用個錢

660
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,000
嚟到令你去犯罪

661
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,400
如果佢有讀聖經

662
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
佢識得點樣回應

663
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
魔鬼嘅說話

664
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
我哋在座嘅

665
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,600
當然唔願意同魔鬼交易

666
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
但係我哋同樣都要

667
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,400
面對好多嘅選擇

668
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
今日你願意嚟崇拜

669
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
呢個都係選擇

670
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
你可以有好多嘢可以做

671
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
呢個選擇

672
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,000
你返唔返煮呀學

673
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,200
呢個都係一個選擇

674
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,800
但財主

675
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,600
我哋仲未解決到

676
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,800
點解

677
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,400
佢要受咁大嘅苦

678
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
點解會咁呢

679
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
約翰一書三章十七節

680
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
可能俾到我哋有答案

681
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,400
佢話犯有世上財物嘅

682
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
看見弟兄窮佛

683
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,600
卻塞住憐憫嘅心

684
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,400
愛神嘅心

685
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
怎能存喺他裏面呢

686
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
呢句說話好想大家

687
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,800
一齊讀一次好唔好

688
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,200
犯有世上財物嘅

689
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
看見弟兄窮佛

690
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
卻塞住憐憫嘅心

691
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
愛神嘅心

692
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,000
怎能存喺他裏面呢

693
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
原來咁樣

694
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,400
原來當

695
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
我哋見到有需要嘅人

696
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
我哋塞住咗憐憫嘅心

697
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
愛神嘅心

698
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,800
冇位存喺你嘅生命裏面

699
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,600
有人話人間最大嘅罪

700
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,000
唔係憎恨

701
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
因為你憎一個人

702
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,000
都會牽動你嘅情感

703
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,800
係咪

704
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,400
你仲會嬲嗰個人

705
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
即係證明仲有少少情

706
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,800
你都仲會肉緊

707
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,600
但係最大嘅罪

708
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
有人就話

709
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
呢個係冷漠

710
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
冷漠即係咩

711
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
即係話

712
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
你對嗰件事嗰個人

713
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
再冇影響你啦

714
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
講得白啲

715
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
佢係生

716
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
佢係死

717
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
你已經唔再

718
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,200
care

719
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
唔再關心

720
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
財主

721
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
可能就係咁

722
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,600
竟然間有一個咁大需要

723
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
混生生瘡嘅人

724
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
畀狗去舔佢嘅瘡

725
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,200
好想食一啲佢吊出嚟嘅零碎

726
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,800
但佢都唔理

727
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,000
我哋點呢

728
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
我哋有冇見到

729
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
有需要嘅事情

730
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
而我哋

731
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,200
就係好冷漠呢

732
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,800
耶穌一直好關心

733
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
弱勢社群同埋貧窮嘅人

734
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,600
所以耶穌一生

735
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
就同貧窮嘅人

736
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
同罪人一齊

737
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
當有一次

738
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,000
佢分享嘅時候喺馬太福音

739
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
佢話當活世嘅時候

740
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800
佢要去

741
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
獎勵

742
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,400
或者話去將一班人

743
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,200
去賜俾佢蒙福嘅生命

744
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,200
因為聖經話享受耶穌為佢預備嘅國

745
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,400
但一班人卻要受永遠嘅刑罰

746
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
耶穌用咩準則呢

747
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
當耶穌讚一班二人

748
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,400
哎呀二人

749
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,600
你可以嚟同我一齊享受天國嘅喜樂

750
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,800
因為呢

751
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
耶穌咁樣講

752
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,400
因為我餓了

753
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,600
你哋俾我食

754
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,400
渴了

755
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
你哋俾我渴

756
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
我作客裏你哋留我住

757
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
我赤身露體

758
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,400
即係冇著衫

759
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,600
你哋俾我穿

760
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
我病了

761
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,000
你哋看顧我

762
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,800
我再監裏你哋嚟睇我

763
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,000
二人就回答說

764
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,600
主啊

765
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,400
我咩時候見你餓呢

766
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
我咩時候見你肚餓

767
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,200
見你渴呢

768
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,400
我咩時候留過你做客裏呢

769
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,800
我咩時候見過你赤身露體

770
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,000
我俾個衫你呢

771
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,800
我又幾時見你病

772
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,600
我又幾時見你坐監

773
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
而去探你呢

774
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
耶穌咁樣回答

775
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
喺廿五章四十節

776
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,600
我實在告訴你哋

777
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,200
這些事你哋既做在我這弟兄中一個最少的身上

778
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,600
就是做在我身上了

779
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,400
一齊讀一次好冇啊

780
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,000
王要回答說

781
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
我實在告訴你哋

782
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:10,000
這些事你哋既做在我這弟兄中一個最少的身上

783
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
就是做在我身上了

784
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
王跟住講

785
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
王又要向那左邊嘅說

786
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,400
你哋被咒咒嘅人離開我

787
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,000
進入那位魔鬼同佢嘅使者所預備嘅永火裏面去

788
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
王要回答說

789
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
我實在告訴你哋

790
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,400
這些事你哋既不做在我這弟兄中一個最少的身上

791
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,000
就是不做在我身上了

792
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,600
這些人要往永營裏去

793
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,200
那些異人要往永生裏去

794
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
四十五節

795
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,600
這些事你哋既不做在我這弟兄中一個最少的身上

796
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,400
就是不做在我身上了

797
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,400
好多時我哋好容易忽略最少嘅一個

798
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,800
嗰個未必係年齡

799
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,600
年齡我哋唔會忽視嘅

800
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
因為我哋見到啲小朋友

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
我哋好開心

802
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,000
我哋見到年青人

803
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,200
我哋好開心

804
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,400
但我哋會唔會好容易

805
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,800
一句說話就係

806
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,400
見高就見低

807
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,600
我哋又有唔同嘅待遇

808
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,800
其實我哋有時基督徒都可能會咁

809
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,400
以前喺香港我好多時都有機會被人邀請

810
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,200
不過我係一個冇乜人識嘅人

811
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,400
但係去一啲好大嘅宴會

812
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
好大嘅宴會

813
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
但係啲人好現實嘅

814
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
譬如開頭我早到冇乜人

815
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,000
咁咪同我傾計

816
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
你呀係我你叫做呂宇峻呀

817
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
係呀係邊度做嘢呀咁樣

818
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,800
跟住傾緊中間

819
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
我想回答佢

820
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,800
但係突然間嘩

821
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,000
啲記者開始郁

822
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,200
跟住就見到邊個達官貴人入嚟

823
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,600
我啪啪啪啪就去曬

824
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
哎呀咩生咩生

825
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,800
哎呀坐呢邊呀哎呀坐呢邊呀咁樣

826
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,200
跟住我自己呆咗

827
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,800
我準備答緊你嘢

828
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,600
同埋好多時唔知係咪真係我又生得細粒

829
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,200
跟住呢個樣有冇乜嘢台型咁樣呢

830
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
我去親邊一個宴會呢

831
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
啲人都以為我係嗰啲大老闆嘅跟班嚟嘅啫

832
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,400
即係玩公事包嗰啲呢

833
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
冇人同我傾計㗎

834
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,400
但原來跟住呢佢一睇到程序表

835
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,600
跟住咦

836
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
你係講完呀今日

837
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
哦係呀

838
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
畀卡片你呀

839
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
咁樣你有冇帶卡片呀

840
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
嘩

841
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,400
嗰個嘴臉

842
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,800
幾現實

843
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,000
即係佢係可以見你唔到嘅

844
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,800
我哋做記錄圖會唔會咁呀

845
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
我唔知

846
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,200
但我真係出嗰啲記錄圖嘅場合

847
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,000
都係咁

848
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,200
嗰啲好似出名啲嗰啲

849
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,800
真係會

850
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
有唔同嘅待遇

851
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
但係當好有需要嗰個人

852
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
喺你門口你都見唔到

853
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
我哋點樣揀呢

854
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,800
原來冷漠係一種錯

855
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,000
漠視

856
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
係一種錯

857
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,000
冇行動

858
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
都係錯

859
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
你話吓唔係呀嘛

860
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
即係你唔揀

861
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
你唔郁

862
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
原來都係錯

863
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
點解冇做都係錯呢

864
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
大家認唔認識呢一個N字頭嘅品牌呀

865
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
呢個係Lokia

866
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
賣電話嘅

867
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
主要我唔知佢有冇其他產品呢

868
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
你仲記唔記得呢個好經典嘅型號呀

869
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
有冇用呢個電話

870
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
我哋香港叫做香蕉

871
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
因為彎彎地

872
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
我都曾經有過呢一隻香蕉

873
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
我用呢個品牌一路係名牌效應

874
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
因為好多人用

875
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
通街都用呢個牌子

876
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
同埋佢真係耐用嘅

877
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
嗰啲咩消費雜誌都話

878
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
佢哋好耐用

879
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
因為真係睇雜誌呢

880
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
話佢啲電話擺落個洗衣機嗰度

881
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
攪攪攪攪攪

882
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
攪半個鐘攞返嚟

883
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
仲用得㗎喎

884
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
有啲未攪就已經唔用得啦

885
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
咁真係好耐用喎呢個品牌

886
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
鋪天蓋地好多人都有

887
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
但係上年

888
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
佢個總裁出嚟講咗一句說話

889
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
佢嘅總裁Lokia

890
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
佢話

891
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We didn't do anything wrong

892
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But somehow we lost

893
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
翻譯做廣東話就係

894
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
我冇做錯嘢呀我哋

895
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Lokia

896
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
但係 somehow 唔知點解

897
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
我哋就失敗咗啦

898
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
其實

899
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
中學生都知佢點樣失敗啦

900
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
中學生都知點解失敗啦

901
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
就係當個幾年前

902
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
我喺大埔住咁呀

903
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
喺啲即係嗰啲叫做廣場呀

904
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
嗰啲呀Shopping mall嗰度呢

905
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
真係有一間Lokia

906
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
但係嗰間嘅員工係好舒服嘅

907
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
永遠去到見到佢哋都係坐喺度

908
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
冇客人再入去啦

909
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
而隔離嗰間舖頭

910
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
嘩 A字頭嘅

911
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
啲水果嗰啲嘅

912
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
嘩 多人到呢

913
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
咁你你同我唔識經濟都知

914
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
人哋做咗咁多產品嘅研發

915
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
做咗咁多廣告

916
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
咁係呢十年過去Lokia做過啲乜嘢呢

917
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
係咪呀

918
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
可能之前大家好引以為傲嘅

919
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
加拿大好出名嘅電話嘅品牌

920
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
佢上個月已經話

921
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
我哋要退出加拿大市場

922
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
我哋要搬去印度啦

923
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
因為佢哋好耐都冇研發過

924
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
一啲新嘅嘢啦

925
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
呢兩個牌子

926
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
後生嗰啲唔識㗎啦

927
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
今日團契嗰啲全部都唔識㗎啦

928
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
呢個叫Xerox

929
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
呢個Xerox係曾經幾十年前好勁嘅做影印機嘅

930
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
佢勁到連字典都擺咗Xerox呢個字落去

931
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
等於copy呀

932
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
嘩你做影印機做到連字典連個字都要用Xerox等於copy

933
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
但我唔知呢間舖頭而家仲有冇

934
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
冇啦

935
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
有弟兄領頭啦

936
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
咁勁嘅品牌冇啦

937
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
跟住呢個Order仲勁

938
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
邊一個未用過Order呀

939
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
你哋囉係咪

940
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
你用過你都用過

941
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
咁你都保養得好好喎

942
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
我哋買飛輪嘅時候你就要呀幾時光

943
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
咩光度就用唔知咩number㗎嘛係咪

944
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
你記得呀係咪

945
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
但係今日呢

946
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
冇啦

947
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
今日冇啦

948
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
佢哋有冇做錯嘢呀

949
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
冇做錯

950
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
但係some how

951
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
佢哋lost咗

952
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
原來我哋冇做

953
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
係有機會

954
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
真係會lost㗎

955
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
我諗公司一樣

956
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
教會可能一樣

957
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
可能有一日

958
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
當耶穌話

959
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
咦點解教會冇乜人嘅

960
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
跟住佢話耶穌冇呀我冇做錯呀

961
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
我咩都冇做

962
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
原來就係因為你乜嘢都冇做

963
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
好多外國嘅教會就咁關門呀

964
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
就係咩都冇做囉

965
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
係咪

966
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
咁我哋點呢

967
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
究竟我哋有咩選擇呢

968
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
睇完呢個比喻

969
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
我諗

970
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
你即刻嘆氣啦係咪

971
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
我唔知你驚唔驚呀

972
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
驚咩呀

973
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
驚唔驚我哋會變成一個咁樣嘅財主

974
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
或者你話

975
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
哎呀呂傳道你做人做得唔夠耐呀

976
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
你唔明㗎啦

977
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
有時唔可以做咁多好心㗎

978
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
如果你有一個拉薩路喺屋企門口

979
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
你真係畀咗錢去

980
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
聽日會點呀

981
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
你哋真係有智慧呀

982
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
聽日有十個拉薩路喺你門口

983
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
你即刻諗呢啲嘢㗎啦嘛

984
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
要你捐錢

985
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
你話捐去邊呀

986
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
邊個會呀

987
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
佢行政費好高㗎喎

988
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
你知唔知有幾多錢係落咗佢哋嗰個裝修寫字樓嗰度呀

989
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
你知唔知啲錢有幾多落到去呀

990
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
嘩你去嗰個咁嘅貪污嘅國家

991
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
你捐

992
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
你捐十蚊

993
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
得一蚊㗎

994
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
我哋好有智慧呀嘛係咪

995
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
我哋咪諗完好多呢啲嘢囉

996
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
但係個問題係諗完好多呢啲嘢之後

997
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
你跟住做啲咩呢

998
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
你跟住就繼續

999
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
我又再睇一睇電視啦

1000
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
啊呢個方中信呀

1001
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
跟住咩都唔記得呀

1002
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
即係話我可能捐十蚊然後都有一蚊去到

1003
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
你坐喺度

1004
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
聖經話你消滅聖靈嘅感動就係呢啲呀我諗

1005
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
因為我哋咩都冇做喎

1006
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
因為我哋用我哋嘅智慧分析完之後

1007
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
唔得呀

1008
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
如果當日財主真係畀咗錢拉曬落

1009
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
而有十個拉曬落

1010
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
有咩所謂呢佢咁多錢

1011
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
你咪起一間唔知咩院舍

1012
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
咪容納佢哋囉

1013
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
有幾難呀

1014
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
我哋要幫人

1015
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
係咪就係用一啲嘅智慧

1016
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
來抹殺咗我哋要幫人嗰個機會呢

1017
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
機會唔係成日都有

1018
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
我相信美國呢件事件

1019
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
最令到美國人

1020
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
最令到全世界嘅人轟動

1021
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
就係原來生命原來機會

1022
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
可以喺嗰零點零幾秒乜都冇曬

1023
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
91事件

1024
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
佢哋美國人突然間驚覺

1025
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
原來生命係咁嘅

1026
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
原來我一路諗住一路做嘢一路工作

1027
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
原來爬到咁高

1028
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
因為有啲好高嘅層㗎嘛去到

1029
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
佢原來一下子

1030
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
一落到嚟就算

1031
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
有幸生還我啲

1032
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
如果你睇電視都係成面灰

1033
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
然之後美國人

1034
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
當91事件過咗

1035
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
可能一個禮拜兩個禮拜

1036
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
你知唔知道

1037
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
突然間有一種嘢

1038
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
有一種物件個銷量

1039
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
突然間飆升

1040
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
就係呢樣

1041
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
就係戒指呀

1042
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
點解戒指飆升呀

1043
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
原來大家把握住個機會

1044
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
去同佢心愛嘅人表達愛意

1045
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
所以戒指飆升

1046
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
佢哋把握住呢個機會

1047
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
因為生命無常

1048
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
我知道今日喺座

1049
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
仍然係有少少人

1050
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
冇選擇耶穌

1051
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
對唔住我講錯咗

1052
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
係未選擇耶穌

1053
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
因為你喺12點45分之前

1054
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
你應該會選擇

1055
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
因為我就會同佢一齊祈禱

1056
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
頭先我一入到嚟

1057
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
見到你嘅時候

1058
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
我即刻都為你祈禱

1059
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
我希望你把握住

1060
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
信耶穌呢個機會

1061
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
因為原來

1062
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
我哋讓時間一路過嘅時候

1063
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
每分鐘都有人離開呢個世界

1064
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
睇到一個報導

1065
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
你知唔知每分鐘

1066
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
有幾多人

1067
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
或者有幾多兒童

1068
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
因為貧窮而死亡呢

1069
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
原來每年有九百萬人

1070
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
係餓死嘅

1071
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
原來每十秒

1072
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
有一個兒童餓死嘅

1073
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
我分享咗呢三十五分鐘

1074
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
原來好多人嘅生命

1075
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
已經冇咗

1076
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
原來佢話

1077
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
喺呢個世界

1078
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
我哋浪費咗個食物

1079
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
只要將浪費嘅食物嘅四分之一

1080
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
攞出嚟

1081
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
原來都夠曬所有

1082
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
飢餓嘅小朋友食

1083
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
唔係講食物嘅四分之一

1084
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
係計我哋浪費咗嘅四分之一

1085
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
今日我哋點樣面對好多嘅浪費

1086
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
我哋喺小食亭見到

1087
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
嗰啲嘅垃圾

1088
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
原來有好多係仲食得

1089
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
不過浪費咗

1090
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
最後呢張

1091
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
就係最後呢個說話

1092
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
我哋好多時都有感動

1093
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
但係感動

1094
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
不如行動

1095
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
我哋諗個辦法

1096
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
點樣將耶穌嘅愛帶出嚟

1097
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
原來耶穌一早講咗

1098
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
就係去關顧嗰個

1099
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
最少

1100
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
最唔起眼

1101
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
嗰個

1102
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
我哋一齊低頭

1103
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
做一個套告

1104
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
喺呢一刻都想

1105
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
你有一個安靜嘅時間

1106
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
我哋啱啱睇完

1107
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
耶穌所講嘅一個比喻

1108
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
講到人死有嘅生命

1109
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
或者可能你話

1110
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
未必有嘅

1111
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
人死如燈滅啫

1112
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
但係港人死如燈滅嗰個人

1113
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
係咪真係知道

1114
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
係咪真係確信

1115
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
死後係冇天堂

1116
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
冇地獄呢

1117
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
但係今日

1118
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
整本聖經

1119
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
就係話畀我哋聽

1120
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
我哋好多弟兄姊妹嘅見證

1121
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
就係話畀我聽

1122
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
話畀我哋聽

1123
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
耶穌係愛我哋嘅

1124
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
有一日

1125
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
世界會滅亡嘅

1126
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
究竟你點樣選擇呢

1127
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
原來冇選擇

1128
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
其實你已經揀咗

1129
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
你揀咗拒絕耶穌

1130
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
原來當我哋見到有貧窮嘅人

1131
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
我哋選擇咗乜都唔做

1132
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
呢個係選擇

1133
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
我哋係咪真係冇能力

1134
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
去做少少嘅幫助呢

1135
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
你知唔知道

1136
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
原來只係加幣

1137
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
55蚊

1138
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
就可以畀一個難民嘅小朋友

1139
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
兩個月嘅食糧

1140
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
我哋願唔願意行動呢

1141
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
我曾經聽過有教會

1142
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
佢哋堅持所有嘅奉獻收入

1143
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
51%

1144
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
係我哋扶貧嘅

1145
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
嗰間教會好興旺

1146
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
未試過短缺

1147
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
今日我哋自己

1148
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
願唔願意

1149
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
踏前一步

1150
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
願唔願意選擇行動

1151
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
願唔願意選擇

1152
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
將耶穌嘅愛帶出去呢

1153
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
親愛的耶穌我哋真係

1154
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
獻上

1155
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
我哋嘅認罪悔改

1156
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
可能我哋有時

1157
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
唔覺意我哋都忽略咗

1158
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
最少嘅一個

1159
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
我哋唔覺意我哋忽略咗

1160
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
教會有需要嘅弟兄姊妹

1161
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
但係今日求你都係畀到

1162
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
我哋願意行動

1163
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
願意帶住你嘅愛去

1164
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
更加敏銳身邊究竟仲有咩人

1165
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
係有需要

1166
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
有咩人係冇嘢食

1167
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
有咩人係冇水飲

1168
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
有咩人係喺患病嘅裏面

1169
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
有咩人係醫院嘅裏面

1170
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
有咩人

1171
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
係仍然未識你

1172
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
嗰個群體

1173
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
而今日

1174
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
如果未接受耶穌嘅朋友

1175
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
我會希望你願意

1176
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
打開你嘅心靈去接受佢

1177
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
我哋咁樣嘅禱告

1178
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
係奉主嘅名求

1179
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
阿姆
