00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
各位大英姐妹平安

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
今日嘅題目呢

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
係乜嘢呀

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
不讓眼淚白流

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
大家有冇流過眼淚呀

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
冇

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
可能我哋有時呢就話

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
啊呢個小朋友好叻呀

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
唔啱㗎咁

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
嗱陣話畀你聽呢

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
可能係未必好㗎喎

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
所以呢希望你快啲擠到兩滴眼淚出嚟

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
我一陣話畀你聽

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
眼淚呢原來分開好多種

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
唔知你信唔信呢

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
跟住咩咩眼淚分開好多種呀

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
講乜嘢呀咁樣

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
咁原來呢根據呢英國

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
英國每日郵報嘅報導呢

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
咁有個攝影師

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
就叫做呢你叫做

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
邁克

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
有個攝影師咁佢做咗個研究

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
佢就話原來人嘅眼淚呢

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
好多唔同㗎

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
咁佢就嘗試呢

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
收集唔同嘅眼淚

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
然之後呢就擺顯微鏡

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
嗰度嚟睇究竟唔同嘅

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
眼淚有冇分別

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
我畀你睇唔同嘅眼淚喎

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
第一種係切洋蔥

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
流出嚟嘅眼淚

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
如果你喺顯微鏡嗰度睇呢

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
係咁嘅喇切洋蔥

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
第二呢就係食辣椒

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
我唔食得辣嘅

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
所以我係咁流汗係咁流眼淚嘅

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
原來嗰滴眼淚係咁嘅

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
辣椒有啲唔同㗎喎

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
而第三種呢

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
如果你試過畀風扇吹到乾曬

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
然之後流嗰啲眼淚呢

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
就係咁嘅

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
有冇發覺唔同先

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
有我三種已經唔同

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
最靚而最唔同嗰種呢

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
係第四種

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
係當你唔開心嘅時候

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
你流嘅眼淚原來咁㗎喎

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
係啦好似啲

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
雪花咁㗎喎

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
咁原來呢嗰個麥克呢

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
佢係喺未做

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
攝影師未做藝術家之前呢

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
原來佢係一個實驗室

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
專做化驗嘅

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
所以佢就將啲眼淚攞曬出嚟

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
然之後呢就係顯微鏡成為唔同嘅晶體

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
跟住你話都唔知係唔係嘅

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
係咪嗰啲藝術家呢

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
喺度做嗰啲設計圖片呀咁

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
咁如果你唔信佢呢

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
又信以下呢個人

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
呢個人呢就係史丹福大學生物化學教授

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
就係叫做Frey

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
咁佢呢就做過

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
一個測試

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
佢就收集兩種眼淚

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
一種就係普通

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
引致嘅眼淚

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
即係頭先講嗰啲咩切洋蔥呀

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
或者你俾人好大力撳一腳

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
流個眼淚

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
而另一方面呢就係情緒唔開心

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
嗰種傷痛嘅眼淚

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
咁佢就搵唔同嘅受試者

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
即係接受測試嘅

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
咁呢就其中一邊呢

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
就俾佢哋睇啲最慘嘅悲劇

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
要整到佢哭為止

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
咁然之後收集咗

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
而另一種呢就係最容易就係切洋蔥

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
結果呢佢發覺呢

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
原來哭呀

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
眼淚

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
如果係切洋蔥流出嚟嘅眼淚呢

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
冇乜特別嘅

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
但係如果你係因為情緒

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
因為悲傷而流嘅眼淚呢

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
佢所含嘅

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
負面嘅嗰啲叫做

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
我講畀你聽下

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
負面嘅嗰種物質

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
係多好多嘅

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
例如有呢一隻叫做猛

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
嘅特質

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
咁原來呢佢就當眼淚

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
就好似排泄咗啲唔好嘅

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
嘅物質出嚟

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
原來係當你有情緒有唔開心嘅時候

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
眼淚係幫你咁樣做

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
咁另外呢

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
仲講咗好多唔好嘅物質排泄出嚟

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
或者幫咗啲好嘅物質

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
不過啲英文呢我講完你都唔知係咩嘅

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
咩ACTH呀

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
嗰啲呢即係好似奶粉廣告咁呢

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
講完嗰啲呢

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
英文你都唔知嘅但係你話好勁咁樣喎

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
咁就變咗呢

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
當佢研究之後佢發覺

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
原來叫大家千祈

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
有唔開心嘅時候唔好忍住

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
唔喊

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
唔喊嘅

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
男咩男人流血不流淚

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
我唔喊嘅原來唔喊呢

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
會令到你呢好多疾病

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
會令到你呢心嘅壓力

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
增加啦高血壓增加啦

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
心臟病增加啦

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
胃潰瘍都增加

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
所患嘅機率所以果下次呢

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
你喊呢係好正常嘅

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
原來上帝設計嘅眼淚呢

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
好似落雪果啲雪花咁呢

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
好特別

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
每粒雪花都唔同原來眼淚

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
上帝喺設計嘅時候

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
都擺咗咁精密嘅設計

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
同埋嘅

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
作用喺度咁今日想

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
同大家分享三個

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
真人真事都係關於

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
眼淚嘅故事

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
第一個呢有關於

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
眼淚嘅傷感故事呢

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
呢個主人翁呢

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
佢細個時候喺英國長大

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
但佢爸爸呢係

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
加拿大嘅士兵嚟嘅

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
不過呢因為佢哋婚姻出現問題

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
所以呢呢個主角呢係未見過

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
爸爸喺佢未出世嘅時候

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
爸爸已經離開咗走咗

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
咁佢主要呢就由

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
爺爺媽媽嚟到去

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
養大好多年之後

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
佢先發現咗

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
佢嗰個家姐

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
因為佢家姐呢將要嫁去德國

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
佢先發現原來嗰個家姐

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
其實係

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
佢親生嘅媽媽

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
嘩咁所以呢個傷痛呢

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
對佢嚟講好大

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
成為咗一個成長好

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
大嘅陰影

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
可能係咁樣佢長大咗之後

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
染上咗毒人

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
染上咗走人

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
佢雖然好細個

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
就帶佢返教會

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
但佢自己講呢

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
佢話佢細個返教會嘅係一個

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Faith 即係一個盲目嘅

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
信仰只不過個爸爸媽媽

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
帶佢返佢就繼續返

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
但係好感恩係1969年

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
嘅時候佢真心相信咗

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
耶穌而經過兩個

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
弟兄姊妹嘅一路嘅關心呢

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
佢戒除咗毒人

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
不過走人呢

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
卻跟住佢20年

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
20年一路返教會

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
一路都解決唔到呢個

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
走人嘅問題無論係去醫院

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
或者去嗰啲叫做Rehab

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
或者去戒酒會呢嗰啲呢

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
完全都唔得

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
但佢雖然一直戒唔到酒

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
不過佢嘅事業呢

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
卻一路一個一個高峰

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
咁嚟到去賣盡

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
但係去到1991年

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
佢自己形容為

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
佢去到一個人生嘅谷底

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hit the rock bottom

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
因為佢受過人生

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
最大嘅一個挫折

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
令佢流咗好多嘅眼淚

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
呢個挫折係咩呢

195
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
就係喺嗰一年

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
佢四歲嘅仔

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
死咗

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
死嘅原因係

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
喺佢嘅

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
apartment 53層高嗰度

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
墮樓死咗

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
嘩呢個打擊對佢嚟講

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
好大好大

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
佢流咗好多眼淚

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
但係佢冇放棄到

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
信仰

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
結果佢寫咗一首歌

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
俾佢嘅仔同俾佢自己

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
歌詞嘅內容

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
大約係咁講嘅

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
佢同個仔講佢話我要強壯

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
我要堅持落去

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
因為我知道

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
打開咗嗰道門之後

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
會得到平安

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
因為嗰度再冇眼淚

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
不如我哋聽一聽

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
佢為個仔

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
寫嗰首歌

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
亦都大家可以留意下歌詞

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
大家有冇聽過呢首歌

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
有啊可原來呢首歌背後

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
係有個咁唔開心

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
嘅故事

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
但係當 Eric

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
佢緊握住

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
信仰嘅時候

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
佢而家已經係三個女兒

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
嘅爸爸

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
佢生活得好愉快

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
點解我話佢冇讓眼淚白流呢

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
就係佢曾經用自己嘅

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
傷痛

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
佢繼續拖住上帝嘅手嘅時候

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
佢繼續運用佢嘅恩賜

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
寫咗好多好嘅詩歌

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
而家周圍一路

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
去演唱去做見證

239
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
佢就係去

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
祝福其他人

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
佢自己都創立咗一個機構

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
叫做Crossroad Center

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
就係專幫嗰啲呢

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
係幫人哋戒人

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
無論係毒人無論走人

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
無論打機總之係一切沉溺嘅行為

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
就去到嗰一個center裏面

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
當佢一路分享嘅時候

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
其中有段說話我覺得

250
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
講得好好

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
佢以前表面上係一個大明星

252
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
當彈結他嘅時候

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
啲人話佢當佢係神

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
即係結他嘅神

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
但佢話真正嘅神係上帝

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
佢話表面上我係一個

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
大明星但係內心我係

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
脆弱得好緊要

259
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
佢自己去回憶返嘅時候佢話

260
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
因為我嘅孩子離世

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
呢件事件

262
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
讓我走入咗一個

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
好私人嘅房間

264
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
我要尋求

265
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
幫助我要跪

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
低我要降服

267
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
最後我發現

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
我一定要返到去一個地方

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
呢個地方其實我一早就知

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
但以前我唔想去

271
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
我唔覺得需要我唔想

272
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
相信但當我

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
真係去咗嗰個地方之後

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
自此我每日跪

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
低嚟討告

276
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
尋求幫助

277
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
我每日都感謝上帝

278
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
俾我堅持

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
清醒

280
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
我必需要放低自己

281
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
謙卑落嚟討告

282
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
如果有人問我

283
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
點解要咁樣做

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
我淨係想話畀你聽

285
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
因為呢個方法

286
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
行得通就係咁

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
簡單

288
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
各位朋友如果當中你仍然未相信

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
耶穌可能聽到呢一度

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
你都有唔同嘅疑問

291
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
你可能會問點解

292
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
上帝要畀個咁可愛

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
嘅小朋友

294
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
只係得四年嘅時間

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
你可能會問點解

296
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
要Eric經歷呢啲傷痛

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
但我可以話畀你聽

298
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
喺呢個世界冇人會將

299
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
個答案話到畀你聽

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
冇人會知道

301
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
但係正正係經歷咗呢件事

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
之後Eric更加深信

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
有一天離開咗呢個短暫

304
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
嘅人生嘅時候佢去到永恆

305
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
佢會見返個小朋友

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
去到永恆嘅時候

307
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
佢會知道答案

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
個關鍵係

309
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
你願唔願意緊握住

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
呢個信仰

311
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
呢個係第一個故事

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
第二個故事係有關於

313
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
一個同眼淚

314
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
有關嘅地方

315
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
當然唔係呢一個

316
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
雖然呢個地方呢個湖仔呢都

317
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
係一粒眼淚

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
我問大家呢個唔算係IQ題

319
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
你知唔知道呢邊一條橋

320
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
係令到

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
人流最多嘅眼淚

322
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
或者令到最多人

323
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
流眼淚知唔知邊一條橋

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
知唔知

325
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Belog

326
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
唔係Belog

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Belog都有令人流眼淚

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
大家知道呢而家Belog橋個工程

329
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
完成未

330
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
未呀可

331
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
但你見唔見到已經有個圍欄

332
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
你之後呢

333
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
當佢拆咗

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
嗰啲布嘅時候

335
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
你會見到一個新嘅圍欄喺度

336
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
呢個圍欄其實就係防止

337
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
流眼淚

338
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
咩意思呢原來平均

339
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
一年有17個人

340
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
喺Belog橋嘗試

341
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
自殺

342
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
係1932年到今日

343
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
大約每年有一個成功

344
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
自殺嘅個案

345
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
真係自殺咗

346
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
真係會令到佢嘅家人

347
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
流好多眼淚不過比起Belog橋

348
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
另外有一條橋

349
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
流嘅眼淚多好多

350
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
係美國嘅

351
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
知唔知邊一條呀

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
係啦三藩市嘅

353
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
金門大橋

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
金門大橋

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
喺1937年

356
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
對外開放之後

357
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
總共有幾多人真係結束

358
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
呢個生命呢係1600人

359
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
你諗下

360
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
1600人背後即係1600個

361
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
家庭朋友

362
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
幾多嘅眼淚

363
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
流咗出嚟

364
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
所以喺呢條橋附近

365
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
有隊嘅巡警

366
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
嗰隊嘅巡警呢係專

367
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
當一有咩事呢

368
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
即刻就去到橋嗰度

369
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
有一日有個已經退咗休幾年嘅巡警

370
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
叫Kevin Briggs

371
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
佢就係做巡警做咗23年

372
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
然之後佢分享返

373
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
太多傷感嘅故事

374
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
太多太多

375
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
但係佢話都唔係冇開心嘅故事嘅

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
因為佢話呢

377
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
當呀

378
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
嗰啲人去到嘗試自殺嘅時候

379
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
佢要去

380
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
攬過嗰條橋

381
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
闊32英吋

382
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
嗰條嘅鋼纜上

383
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
因為你要擒咗個欄杆

384
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
去到32英吋

385
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
嗰個鋼纜然之後企喺度

386
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
佢話絕大部分人都企喺嗰個位

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
然之後最後

388
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
決定跳唔跳落去

389
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
佢話但係去到嗰陣時

390
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
通常對所有人嚟講

391
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
呢個係佢人生最黑暗嘅時候

392
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
因為佢覺得冇曬希望

393
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
所以佢選擇

394
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
攬過嗰個欄杆

395
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
咁有一日

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
叫Kevin嘅

397
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
佢就收到一個電話

398
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
喺2005年3月11號

399
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
佢收到個電話就有人報導

400
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
有人企圖自殺

401
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
結果佢揸住佢嘅電單車即刻去到

402
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
結果去到嘅時候

403
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
佢就見到

404
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
嗰個人想自殺嗰個人

405
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
就係呢個

406
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
後生仔因為後生仔嗰陣時大約十幾歲

407
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
嗰個後生仔

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
咁啱都係叫Kevin不過叫Berthier

409
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
所以呢個叫細Kevin

410
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
我叫做細Kevin

411
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
然之後大Kevin

412
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
係嗰次成功令佢

413
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
抹乾咗細Kevin

414
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
嘅眼淚

415
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
亦都抹乾咗細Kevin屋企人嘅眼淚

416
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
佢真係見到佢

417
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
扶返佢入去

418
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
你見到嗰幅相就係兩個人

419
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
左邊嗰個就係大Kevin

420
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
佢未退休之前

421
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
佢就捉返扶返

422
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
細Kevin入去

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
當扶佢入去嘅時候

424
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
大Kevin第一句說話就恭喜細Kevin

425
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
佢話呢個係你一個

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
新嘅開始

427
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
新嘅生命

428
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
然之後佢問返佢

429
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
點解最終你決定

430
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
畀我哋扶返你入嚟

431
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
點解最終你決定

432
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
爬返入嚟

433
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
細Kevin咁樣講

434
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
佢話就係因為

435
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
喺我講嘢

436
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
嘅時候

437
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
你肯安靜

438
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
聆聽

439
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
因為喺佢嘅成長裏面

440
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
佢屋企好唔開心

441
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
佢學校好唔開心

442
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
你就怪責佢

443
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
一定係你嘅問題

444
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
一定係你唔啱

445
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
或者冇人會願意聆聽

446
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
佢嘅唔開心

447
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
你講嚟講去都係嗰啲

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
所以當

449
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
佢畀人救起之後

450
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
佢繼續佢嘅人生細Kevin

451
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
佢而家又咁啱

452
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
又係一個三個孩子嘅

453
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
好爸爸

454
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
佢仲周圍去演講

455
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
而家你見到嗰個樣

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
大過咗嗰個佢

457
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
大過咗嘅

458
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
大細Kevin喺度

459
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
佢周圍去演講就係同人哋分享

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
要珍惜生命

461
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
佢曾經講嗰句說話我覺得好有意思

462
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
佢話抑鬱症

463
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
或者係你嘅生命

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
嘅一部分

465
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
但絕對唔係你嘅全部

466
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
depression may be a part of you

467
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
but it is not

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
who you are

469
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
有時我哋就係將我哋嘅困境

470
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
放到好大

471
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
去親邊一度去親任何地方

472
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
自己一唔開心嘅就係呀我係一個抑鬱症嘅人

473
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
係呀我係一個單親家庭嘅人

474
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
係呀因為乜乜乜我係好唔開心嘅

475
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
但原來呢個

476
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
只不過係你人生嘅

477
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
一部分

478
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
你未必需要放到好大

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
然之後影響晒你正常

480
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
嘅生活

481
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
所以佢回想返

482
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
當日細Kevin話當我想結束

483
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
生命嘅時候我突然間

484
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
聽到一把聲音

485
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
即係話當佢喺個鋼纜上面

486
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
準備跳落去嘅時候細Kevin

487
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
突然間聽到一把聲音係拉返佢轉頭

488
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
嗰把聲音係咩呢

489
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
就係帶Kevin講

490
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
hey wait a minute

491
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
hey wait a minute

492
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
等等

493
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
從細Kevin嘅經驗

494
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
讓我哋知道原來當

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
有人聆聽

496
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
流緊眼淚嘅人

497
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
當有人去同流緊眼淚嘅人

498
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
講wait

499
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
a minute

500
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
原來就可以拯救一個人嘅人生

501
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
然之後當佢人生冇白流佢嘅

502
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
眼淚嘅時候竟然間今日可以

503
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
周圍去改變去鼓勵

504
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
好多人今日做

505
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
基督徒嘅我哋

506
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
願唔願意留意下身邊

507
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
有冇人需要我哋

508
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
聆聽佢嘅聲音

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
但係頭先幾首詩歌

510
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
都話到比我哋聽

511
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
耶穌好願意

512
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
聆聽我哋嗰個

513
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
微聲嘅呼求

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
好微弱

515
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
嘅嗰一個呼求

516
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
最後第三個

517
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
有關於眼淚嘅故事

518
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
呢個故事係基督徒好熟悉嘅

519
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
我一陣一講

520
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
你就話哎呀又講

521
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
聽過好多啦

522
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
你咁快識笑嘅我都未講

523
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
聽過好多啦

524
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
但係當我講嘅時候

525
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
你聽多陣 wait a minute

526
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
你聽多一分鐘

527
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
你就發覺有啲嘢可能平時你忽略咗

528
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
當我今次預備嘅時候

529
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
我一預備我話哎呀

530
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
對不起大家原來我一路分享嘅時候

531
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
我真係忽略咗呢一part

532
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
咁緊要嘅部分我今日分享埋

533
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
呢個就係有一日

534
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
因為有啲新朋友我都要講返少少背景

535
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
有一日就係耶穌食飯嘅時候

536
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
有個婦人

537
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
不請自來

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
然後一嚟到係耶穌嘅面前

539
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
打破咗一個

540
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
好靚嘅玉瓶

541
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
跟住你話

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
就係嗰個啦

543
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
裝住好貴嘅香膏

544
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
好人好熟悉

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
好多人好熟悉

546
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
但原來當果一次同耶穌相遇嘅時候

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
原來呢個女士

548
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
有啲好緊要嘅嘢

549
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
我係一路忽略咗

550
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
同大家分享

551
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
係路加芬記載嘅時候

552
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
佢真不請自來

553
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
去到耶穌嗰度嘅時候

554
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
其實佢係站喺耶穌嘅後面

555
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
挨住耶穌嘅腳

556
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
佢嘅眼淚

557
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
聖經記載

558
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
佢嘅眼淚滴濕咗

559
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
耶穌嘅腳

560
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
然之後佢用佢自己嘅頭髮

561
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
幫耶穌抹乾

562
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
腳上嘅眼淚

563
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
不但止

564
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
佢之後就仲向耶穌嘅腳

565
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
親嘴

566
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
接耶穌嘅腳

567
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
然之後先至將個香膏

568
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
倒上去

569
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
原來成幅圖畫成個故事

570
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
最完整係咁樣

571
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
大家有冇諗過

572
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
點解嗰個女士

573
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
會喊住

574
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
去搵耶穌

575
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
或者話一見到耶穌就喊

576
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
聖經冇直接嘅交代

577
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
不過如果我推想

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
我相信係因為嗰個女人

579
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
覺得自己好多嘅罪

580
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
喺佢嘅生命裏面

581
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
因為當時請耶穌食飯嘅

582
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
中間有一啲法理賽人

583
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
即係對宗教

584
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
好執著好敬虔嘅人

585
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
咁呢個法理賽人

586
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
聖經話心裏面就喺度諗

587
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
如果耶穌係先知

588
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
佢一定知道摸佢嗰個女人

589
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
係乜嘢嘅女人

590
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
乃是個罪人

591
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
耶穌看穿咗佢嘅心

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
可以read到佢嘅mind

593
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
然後耶穌講咗一個比喻

594
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
耶穌話

595
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
有一個債主

596
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
有兩個人欠咗佢債

597
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
即係兩個債仔

598
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
一個爭佢五十兩銀子

599
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
一個爭佢五兩銀子

600
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
記住喎

601
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
一個五十一個五兩

602
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
因為佢哋兩個都無力償還

603
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
結果債主就開恩赦免咗

604
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
嗰兩個人嘅債

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
呢兩個人

606
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
更加愛過債主呢

607
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
耶穌就問

608
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
咁我請佢食飯個西門就答

609
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
我諗係個個多得

610
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
恩赦免嘅人

611
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
耶穌話你答得

612
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
不錯

613
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
於是就轉過嚟向住嗰個女人

614
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
就對西門說

615
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
你睇呢個女人我入咗你

616
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
屋企你冇畀我水洗腳

617
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
但呢個女人竟然間用眼淚

618
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
洗我隻腳

619
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
然之後用頭髮擦乾

620
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
你冇同我親嘴

621
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
但呢個女人入嚟我

622
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
從我入嚟嘅時候就不住嘅

623
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
用嘴親我嘅腳

624
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
你冇用油抹我嘅頭

625
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
但呢個女人卻用香膏抹我嘅腳

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
所以我告訴你

627
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
佢許多嘅罪都赦免了

628
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
因為佢嘅愛

629
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
多

630
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
但嗰赦免少嘅

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
佢嘅愛就少

632
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
跟住耶穌就對嗰個女人

633
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
話你嘅罪

634
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
赦免了

635
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
耶穌抹乾咗

636
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
呢個女人嘅眼淚

637
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
我哋流眼淚

638
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
可能有好多好多

639
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
好多嘅原因

640
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
當我哋好多時見到

641
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
有人唔開心嘅時候

642
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
你見到嘅可能

643
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
只係表面嘅原因

644
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
呢心理學家話我哋好多時

645
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
真正隱藏喺我哋眼淚

646
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
下面嘅其實係一個冰山

647
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
我哋見到嘅

648
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
真係只係浮喺面

649
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
冰山嘅一個角落頭

650
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
佢真正嘅傷痛係

651
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
下面嗰啲嘅冰山

652
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
嗰啲可能係隱藏可能要透過我哋

653
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
好多聆聽先聆聽到

654
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
佢真正嘅傷痛

655
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
並唔係我哋見到表面

656
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
嗰啲嘅嘢

657
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
所以個小朋友好嘢好嘢好嘢

658
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
佢真正嘅困難

659
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
可能就係佢裏面

660
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
個冰山顯示出嚟

661
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
佢啲嘅困難

662
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
耶穌就係知道佢

663
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
真正嘅困難

664
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
所以佢話你嘅罪

665
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
卸咗

666
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
各位朋友

667
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
耶穌親自講嘅

668
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
所以好多人

669
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
當我哋同佢傳福音

670
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
佢唔信耶穌

671
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
點解呢?佢話

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
我唔配

673
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
當有時有啲嘅

674
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Counsellor 即係有啲輔導者

675
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
或者有啲嘅牧者去到想去幫佢哋嘅時候

676
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
好多人會拒絕就係因為佢話

677
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
我唔值得你幫

678
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
但我好想話俾嗰啲人聽

679
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
冇唔值得

680
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
幫嘅人

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
冇嘅罪

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
係大到耶穌救唔到你

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
我哋要記住呢個

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
耶穌所講嘅比喻

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
係因為耶穌親自話

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
邊一個嘅罪多反而

687
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
你得到赦免

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
嗰種恩典係大

689
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
個關鍵係你願唔願意

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
返去感謝

691
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
耶穌同埋接受

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
耶穌所俾你

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
嗰一日嗰個女人得到耶穌嘅

694
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
祝福之後就可以平平安安

695
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
咁返屋企

696
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
嚟到結論嘅時候

697
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
我哋唔讓眼淚

698
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
白流

699
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
各位朋友

700
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
各位弟兄姊妹我相信大家

701
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
頭先你都話你流過

702
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
眼淚

703
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
你哋嘅眼淚

704
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
係咪白流呢

705
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
我記得好幾年前有個媽咪

706
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
佢話叫我

707
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
你幫我同我個女傾下計

708
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
佢日日都喊得好唔開心

709
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
日日都喊好唔開心

710
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
因為啱啱考完

711
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
考完個會考

712
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
等放榜係高考

713
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
等放榜

714
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
日日都喺度喊

715
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
日日都唔開心

716
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
跟住我同佢傾計

717
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
我一去到

718
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
佢一見到我

719
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
佢嚟我office

720
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
嘩佢就即刻喊

721
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
跟住我攞個盒紙巾

722
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
嗰盒紙巾本來得一半到

723
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
好快俾佢溶曬

724
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
係咁喊係咁生鼻涕係咁喊

725
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
跟住我喺度睇佢喊咗一陣

726
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
跟住我問咗佢個問題

727
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
我話咦

728
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
做咩你喊呀

729
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
跟住佢話

730
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
咁

731
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
佢未答我

732
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
跟住我話咁你做咩喊

733
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
死緊呀

734
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
咁佢係死緊喎第一句

735
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
跟住我話點解死緊呀

736
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
佢話實係考唔到大學啦

737
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
因為個高考就決定你入唔入到大學

738
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
跟住佢話實係考唔到大學

739
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
我嗰陣時

740
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
又未學上次個災難化

741
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
因為佢不斷都係災難化

742
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
入唔到大學就好大件事

743
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
爸爸媽咪又失望

744
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
同學仔又交代唔到

745
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
我啲同學好叻㗎又入晒大學

746
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
如果我入唔到要重讀就大件事

747
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
我係咁講晒好多災難化嘅嘢

748
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
跟住我話

749
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
咁如果入到呢

750
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
咁佢突然停一停

751
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
佢好似冇諗過入到

752
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
咁樣

753
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
我話咁如果入到呢

754
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
佢話入到就開心啦

755
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
咁我話你而家入唔到你咩

756
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
佢話唔係呀

757
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
咁我話咁你

758
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
哭嚟做咩啫

759
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
咁佢話咁驚呀嘛

760
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
我話驚係可以哭

761
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
但你使唔使哭咁耐

762
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
你哭咗兩個禮拜

763
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
咁我話你兩個禮拜做咗咩

764
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
我咩都冇做呀

765
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
咁佢兩個禮拜咩都冇做

766
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
我話不如咁

767
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
我話唔好令到你哂咗啲眼淚

768
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
反正你哭

769
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
我話你知唔知改卷嗰個改完㗎啦

770
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
就算如果有一日

771
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
佢知道你哭成咁呢

772
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
我話改卷嗰人又唔識你

773
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
嗰人又改完啦

774
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
嗰啲成績表都印晒啦

775
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
不過未出新聞咋嘛

776
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
未寄到你屋企咋嘛

777
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
我話你而家點哭都改變唔到㗎啦

778
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
佢話我知呀

779
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
我話咁咪係囉

780
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
咁你知咪

781
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
我話不如咁你而家做咩呢

782
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
我話你而家去諗寫低戶返屋企自己

783
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
第一個

784
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
入到你最想入嗰間大學

785
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
因為佢想好似讀法律定係讀咩

786
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
入到點樣同媽咪講去邊度旅行慶祝

787
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
諗定去邊度旅行

788
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
去定啲旅行社

789
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
攞定嗰啲計劃

790
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
講埋總之一攞

791
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
一知道入到最好嗰間大學

792
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
你就即刻同媽咪講我哋去報名啦

793
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
我話第二就係

794
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
入到你唔係好想嘅大學你會點

795
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
你又寫低

796
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
我話第三

797
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
真係好似你而家喊到喊苦喊忽

798
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
然之後真係咩都入唔到

799
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
咁你點

800
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
我話你返去即刻做呢啲行動

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
然之後今個禮拜

802
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
同媽咪返教會嘅時候

803
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
一路祈禱

804
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
求上帝帶領你

805
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
整個嘅過程

806
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
我一路講嘅時候佢啲眼淚真係停咗

807
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
跟住仲攞支筆咁樣喺度抹低

808
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
即係好乖嘅啲學生

809
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
喺度寫寫寫

810
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
第一第二第三

811
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
跟住我話喊完啦嘛

812
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
我話返屋企啦

813
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
我話我好多野做啊

814
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
跟住佢返屋企

815
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
即係有時我都冇乜同情心

816
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
因為佢喊咗我成半個鐘

817
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
咁我有聆聽嘅

818
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
好乖嘅好似戴Kevin咁

819
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
結果隔咗唔知三日定四日

820
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
佢媽咪即刻打嚟多謝我

821
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
佢話

822
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
哎呀女呀入咗呀

823
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
佢最想入嗰間呀

824
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
而家我哋去旅行啦報名啦咁樣

825
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
當然佢冇責怪我要佢花錢去旅行嘅

826
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
跟住我就

827
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
再同返個女仔叫Crystal

828
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
我話係咪呢

829
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
你係咪浪費咗你啲眼淚呢

830
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
你留咗成兩個禮拜

831
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
我話你真係白流咗

832
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
你嗰啲眼淚

833
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
各位大兄姐妹

834
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
有時我哋啲眼淚真係

835
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
白流㗎

836
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
白流嘅原因係你信唔過上帝囉

837
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
即係話咩呀

838
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
嗰啲事都未發生

839
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
你就災難化咗件事

840
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
如果你記得喺A

841
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
喺B嘅時候你冇擺過咩字呀

842
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
P

843
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
大家好好

844
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
你冇擺過P嘅時候

845
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
跟住你就係咁喺度驚係咁喺度喊

846
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
係咁喺度災難化件事

847
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
但係可能根本嗰件事

848
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
就唔係你諗咁災難發生

849
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
好似呢位Crystal小姐一樣

850
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
根本

851
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
一早已經印咗成績單

852
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
佢係入到嗰間佢讀法律嘅大學

853
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
只不過佢未收到啫

854
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
另一樣

855
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
白流就係

856
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
我哋冇學Eric Clapton

857
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
呢位弟兄

858
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
佢係傷痛㗎啦

859
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
佢係會唔開心㗎

860
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
冇咗兒子呢件事

861
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
已經成為咗事實㗎啦

862
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
個A喺度㗎啦

863
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
但問題係

864
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
佢冇用眼淚白流

865
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
就係佢繼續運用上帝嘅恩賜

866
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
去創作好多好嘅歌

867
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
佢而家仲不斷

868
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
巡迴緊去為上帝

869
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
做見證

870
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
我哋都係會有唔同嘅傷痛

871
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
但係呢個傷痛

872
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
係冇得改變

873
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
係你生命嘅一部分

874
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
不過

875
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
唔係你嘅全部

876
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
你仲有好多好多精彩嘅人生

877
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
可以等住去做

878
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
喺啟示六

879
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
二十一章四節有句經文

880
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
咁樣講

881
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
對於基督徒嚟講

882
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
當我哋哀傷嘅時候

883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
我哋要記住呢段經文

884
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
二十一章四節

885
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
神要拆去

886
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
佢哋一切嘅眼淚

887
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
有一個地方唔再有死亡

888
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
亦都唔再有悲哀

889
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
唔再有哭號疼痛

890
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
因為以前嘅事

891
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
都過啦

892
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
請記住

893
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
神要親自抹去

894
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
我哋每一個人嘅眼淚

895
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
當我哋哀傷過後

896
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
盼望我哋會做到羅馬書十二章十五節

897
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
咁樣講與喜樂嘅人

898
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
同喜樂

899
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
與哀哭嘅人

900
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
同哀哭

901
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
因為哀傷嘅人最需要嘅

902
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
係支持者

903
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
好似金門大橋出面嗰個

904
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
細Kevin一樣

905
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
各位朋友

906
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
如果當我哋

907
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
諗到頭先提到嗰個婦人

908
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
今日

909
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
如果你帶住唔同嘅傷痛

910
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
當離開你間教會嘅時候

911
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
我好想

912
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
與嗰個女人一樣

913
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
你嘅眼淚會被抹乾

914
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
因為我哋唔知你嘅傷痛

915
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
唯有耶穌先

916
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
真真正正知道你個冰山

917
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
究竟係乜嘢

918
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
但耶穌話好想

919
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
同你同行

920
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
好似有句聖經話

921
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
看呀

922
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
我站喺門外敲門

923
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
如果有人聽見我嘅聲音

924
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
就開門嘅話

925
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
我會進到佢嘅裏面去

926
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
我與佢,佢與我

927
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
好似一齊坐直咁

928
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
耶穌一路

929
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
喺度敲緊

930
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
你心裏面嗰道門

931
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
個問題就係話

932
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
你唔願意打開你嘅心門

933
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
呢個心門

934
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
揸住個心門反鎖咗

935
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
呢道門嘅鎖匙

936
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
喺你嗰度

937
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
你先可以真真正正

938
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
去unlock

939
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
去打開呢道門

940
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
但係你唔願意呢

941
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
讓我哋一齊

942
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
有個結束嘅禱告

943
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
我想先讀一段嘅經文

944
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
然之後我想有個邀請

945
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
我想邀請

946
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
如果未相信耶穌嘅你

947
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
你願意打開

948
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
你嘅心門

949
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
將你嘅傷痛

950
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
親自同耶穌講

951
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
讓佢親自去抹乾

952
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
佢嘅眼淚

953
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
有個人咁樣禱告

954
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
佢話主呀

955
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
如今我等什麼呢

956
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
我嘅指望

957
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
在乎你

958
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
求你救我脫離一切嘅過犯

959
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
唔好使我受如還人嘅羞辱

960
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
因我所遭遇嘅

961
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
如果係出於你

962
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
我就默言不語

963
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
求你把你嘅責罰

964
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
從我嘅身上免去

965
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
因你手嘅責打

966
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
我便消滅

967
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
你因人嘅罪惡懲罰佢嘅時候

968
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
叫佢嘅笑容消滅

969
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
如衣被蟲所咬

970
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
世人真是虛幻

971
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
耶穌話

972
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
求你聽我嘅禱告

973
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
留心聽我嘅呼求

974
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
我流淚

975
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
求你不要靜默無聲

976
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
因為在

977
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
我在你面前

978
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
係客侶係寄居嘅

979
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
像我列祖一般

980
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
求你寬容我

981
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
使我再去而不返之先

982
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
可以力量復原

983
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
各位未信耶穌嘅朋友

984
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
如果你願意

985
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
相信耶穌嘅話

986
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
願意打開你嘅心門嘅話

987
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
我想你跟住

988
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
同我做呢個嘅禱告

989
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
親愛嘅耶穌

990
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
我願意打開我嘅心門

991
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
邀請你進入我嘅生命裏面

992
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
做我人生嘅主宰

993
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
同我同行

994
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
親自抹乾我嘅眼淚

995
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
咁樣嘅禱告

996
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
係奉主嘅名求

997
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
阿門
