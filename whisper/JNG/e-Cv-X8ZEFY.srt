00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
各位訂閱者們,各位朋友,你們好!

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,680
歡迎大家參加我們三藩市播道會網上的五堂崇拜

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,800
我們今天繼續思想希伯羅書的信息

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,480
我們就來到希伯羅書第十一章第四節

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
信超越死亡

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,560
未開始思想這段聖經之前請同心低頭和討告

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,440
慈悲仁愛天父,我們滿心多謝你

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,680
因為耶穌基督已經戰勝了死亡

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,720
我們藉著相信耶穌基督,我們也是戰勝死亡

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720
有永生的盼望

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,560
求你藉著你的話語去提醒,勸勉,教導,安慰,篤責,改變我們

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,560
我們這樣討告,乃是奉耶穌基督命求,阿門

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,800
在開始討論這節聖經之前

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
我們來看看查理·布朗的一幅漫畫

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
你看到查理·布朗愁眉苦臉

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,360
臉色長長,極不開心

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,840
不知道他遇到不如意的事情

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
意志搞成這樣

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
於是他就找人幫幫忙

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,440
他見到路西開了一檔心理輔導

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,480
只需要五個先就可以搞定

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,120
於是查理·布朗就到路西那裡接受心理輔導

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,440
他問路西,究竟要做什麼才適應這個世界

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,920
當你發現你的生命好像很快在你身邊略過

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
我們應該怎樣做呢

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
路西就說,你來,跟我來,我有東西給你看看

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
你看不看到遠處的水平線

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,240
你看不看到這個世界是多麼大

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,000
這個大世界怎會不容得下你,我和所有人呢

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
跟著路西就問他

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
除了這個世界之外

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
你有沒有見到其他世界

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
查理·布朗沒有

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
照我所知

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
這個世界就是唯一的世界,對不對

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
對不對,對

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,560
你是不是出生在這個世界,活在這個世界

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,920
你在這個現代的時代,在這個現實的世界住,是不是

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
是,好,既然這樣

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,560
你就要好好在這個世界活下去,知道嗎

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
現在給錢

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
先給五個

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,240
事實上,世界上有很多人,好像查理·布朗一樣

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
他們極之不開心

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,240
很難適應在他們自己的現實生活裡面

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,520
很難適應他們所謂這個世界裡面

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,240
想逃避、自閉、逃跑,極之不開心

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,040
我想,不過是三大問題

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
第一個問題就是

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
以為只有人錯,我沒有錯

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
無論你是一個完美主義者

52
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,480
每次要求自己是要完美沒有錯

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
又或者你是一個法理錯的人,以為人人有錯,只有你才對

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
這些是自大狂

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
其實都是一樣,同一問題

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
不能夠接受

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
也不能夠承認自己有錯

58
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
自己有罪

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
有缺陷,有憂暗

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
有不完美的地方

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
這樣的人

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
既不能夠接受自己有錯

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
於是就盡量去保護自己

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
維護自己

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
免得別人發現自己是有錯的

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
是不對的

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
這樣的時候,自己就完蛋了

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,520
於是就千方百計去維護自己的形象

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,520
扮演一個沒有錯的完美人的角色

70
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,520
如果不能夠再扮演的時候就索性走路

71
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
說一句話,這世界非公世界

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,520
自閉自殺逃避

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
這些人是很痛苦的

74
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
第二個問題是什麼呢

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
我稱為應該主義者

76
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,520
你以為每樣都應份的

77
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
我回到教會,人人都要尊敬我

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
是應份的

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
我投資賺到錢是應份的

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
子女聽我說是應份的

81
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
太陽明天一定要普照

82
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
陽光普照是應份的

83
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,520
我有飯吃,有衣服穿,有錢花,是應份的

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
這些人是很痛苦的

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
因為當他們以為是應份的東西

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
往往就不是屬於他們的

87
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
就好像該人一樣

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
他們以為神祝福他們

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
接納他們的憲制是應份的

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
如果不是的話,他們就憤怒了

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
妒忌了,貪婪了,痛苦了

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
相反來說

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
如果我們把所有的東西

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
我們認為是應份的改為是恩典

95
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
天都降了

96
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
人家尊重我,是恩典來的

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
子女聽我說是恩典來的

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
有飯吃,有衣服穿,也是恩典來的

99
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
我們全感恩的心

100
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
這個人就幸福了

101
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
這是第二個問題

102
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
應該主義

103
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
第三個問題就是窒道

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
你看看歷史

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
有多少英雄豪傑

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
因為權的問題,窒道的問題

107
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
令到身敗名裂

108
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
以上三個問題

109
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
正是聖經裏面所說

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
該人的問題

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
他的精結就是自我中心的罪性

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
今天我們所研讀的一節聖經

113
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,520
看到阿伯的信心

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
他是信心龍虎榜的第一個英雄

115
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
也可以說

116
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
他是兄弟該人的相反

117
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
如果我們一生要過得幸福

118
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
要開心,就要害阿伯

119
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
如果我們反叛,容中,好像該人一樣

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,520
你就一定極之不開心

121
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,520
像該人一樣,永遠不得到幸福

122
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
我們看看這一節

123
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
是非常精彩的經文

124
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
阿伯因著信憲祭與神

125
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
被該人所獻的更美

126
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
因此免得了輕易的見證

127
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
就是神指他禮物作見證

128
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
他雖然死了

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,520
卻因者信應舊說話

130
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
這節聖經信

131
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
希臘文的Pisces

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
這個字出現了三詞

133
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
也正好說出

134
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
信的三個非常重要的特色

135
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
第一

136
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
因著信,阿伯就憲祭與神

137
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
第二

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
因著信,他就被神稱為兒

139
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
第三

140
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
因著信,他雖然死了

141
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
卻仍舊說話

142
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
既奇怪

143
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
又精彩

144
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
讓我們逐一來研究

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
這三個信的特色

146
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
究竟信是何物

147
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
第一

148
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
我們看看信看到自己的缺陷

149
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
我們看看信的第一個元素

150
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
阿伯因著信憲祭與神

151
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
被該人所憲的更美

152
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
信第一個元素

153
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
就是憲祭與神

154
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
這裡提到有兩種憲祭

155
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,520
一是阿伯的憲祭

156
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
另一個是該人的憲祭

157
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
希伯羅書的作者說

158
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
阿伯所憲的

159
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
是被該人所憲的更美

160
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
所謂更美

161
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
不是表面的美

162
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
包裝的美

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
不是,其實更美的

164
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
原文是指

165
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
更蒙越南

166
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
甚至可以這樣說

167
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
只有阿伯的憲祭

168
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
才是蒙神的越南

169
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
這是什麼意思

170
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
我們看看

171
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
創世紀第四章

172
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
1至17次的背景

173
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
第四章第一節

174
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
第六節就是這樣說

175
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
那人與妻子同房

176
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
懷了人生了該人

177
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
後來又生了另一個兒子

178
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
阿伯,阿伯是牧羊的

179
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
該人是種地的

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
該人拿地裡的出產為供物

181
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
獻給耶和說

182
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
阿伯也將羊群中

183
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
頭山的

184
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
草山的

185
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
植

186
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
並且將羊的植油獻上

187
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
耶和看中了

188
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
阿伯和他的供物

189
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
只是看不中

190
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
該人和他的供物

191
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
該人大大地發怒

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
臉上變了色

193
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
耶和說對該人說

194
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
你為什麼發怒呢

195
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
你為什麼臉上變了色呢

196
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
你若行得好,豈不蒙越南

197
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
你若行得不好,罪就伏在面前

198
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
他必戀無理

199
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
你卻要制伏他

200
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
聖經說

201
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
阿伯是獻上

202
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
頭生的羊羔

203
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
和羊的脂肪

204
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
脂油

205
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
神是接納他的獻上

206
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
他的供物

207
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
但是該人是獻上土產的出產

208
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
神就不接納他的獻上

209
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
不接納他的供物

210
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
我們就會問

211
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
這個很不公平

212
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
他們職業不同

213
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
養羊就獻羊

214
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
種菜就獻菜

215
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
為什麼眾此而輕脾呢

216
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
耶和說豈不是很不公平

217
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
不是

218
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
你再看清楚這段經文

219
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
耶和說不越納

220
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
該人的獻制

221
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
不是因為所獻的是土產

222
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
而是他自己的人有問題

223
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
所以第七節就這麼說

224
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
你若行得好

225
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
豈不蒙越南

226
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
你若行得不好

227
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
罪就伏在你面前

228
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
他必戀無理

229
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
換句話說

230
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
神不是看他們所獻的是什麼

231
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
神是看

232
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
他自己的人的內心

233
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
是想什麼

234
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
事實上生命記、利未記

235
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
亦都記載到神是

236
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
越納獻上的土產

237
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
我們會問

238
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
該人有什麼不妥呢

239
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
阿伯的獻制為什麼會蒙越納呢

240
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
一言閉字

241
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
因為

242
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
阿伯是有信

243
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
該人是沒有信

244
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
何解

245
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
如果你看一看創世的第四章

246
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
一至六節

247
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
和其他經文

248
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
我們最低限度看到

249
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
該人的為人

250
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
和他獻制的不妥

251
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
是有極大的關係

252
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
首先我們看看他們的名字

253
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
聖經的名字往往

254
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
是很有意思的

255
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
該人這個名字

256
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
是什麼意思呢

257
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
希伯羅名字叫得了

258
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
意思是你朝思夢想

259
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
所要求的東西

260
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
你拍拖、投婚、成功了

261
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
那你就得了

262
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
你考有大學

263
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
搞定了,得了

264
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
所以

265
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
他們很想學問有個兒子

266
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
現在得了

267
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
所以就改了名字叫做該人

268
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
充滿了喜樂

269
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
滿足、興奮的心

270
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
跟著生第二個

271
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
改了名字叫做

272
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
阿伯

273
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
阿伯是什麼意思

274
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
阿伯叫

275
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,520
一口氣

276
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
或者是虛空的意思

277
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
第一個兒子

278
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
就叫做得了

279
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
興奮和開心

280
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
到第二個兒子

281
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
來到的時候

282
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
就嘆一句

283
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
那又怎樣呢

284
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
一聲嘆息

285
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
其實已經暗示了

286
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
該人帶給父母

287
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
很多很多的問題

288
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
很多很多的煩惱

289
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
不是滿足

290
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
不是興奮

291
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
是幻滅

292
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
一定有點不對

293
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
究竟有什麼不對呢

294
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
你看看他的獻物

295
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
我們就看得出他不對之處

296
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
有些解經家

297
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
以為阿伯獻上的是

298
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
羊群中投聖的

299
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
這個似乎是屬於

300
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
一種罪制

301
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
因為阿伯看到自己有罪

302
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
他將活物獻制

303
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
作為罪的屬罪制

304
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
而該人沒有看到自己的罪

305
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
只是存著一個高傲的心

306
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
去獻土產

307
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
如果這個是屬實

308
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
我們就看得出信的第一個條件

309
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
就是要看到自己的

310
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
廬山真面目

311
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
就是罪人

312
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
人如果看到自己的罪

313
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
他就懂得去獻上

314
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
屬罪制

315
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
如果人看不到自己的罪的時候

316
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
就算你搜了所有宗教禮儀

317
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
一切的規條

318
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
都是妄言

319
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,520
信第一個重要的元素

320
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,520
就是承認體驗自己是罪人

321
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
就好像耶穌基督說

322
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
令裏面貧窮的人有福

323
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
因為天國是貪不得

324
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
或者有些解經家

325
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
就以為將投生為制

326
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
視為一種屬罪制

327
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
是有點牽強

328
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
很明顯

329
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
神不如立該人的憲制

330
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
是一定和他個人有關

331
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
正如猶太的歷史學家

332
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
做Sifus這樣說過

333
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
該人的品性敗壞

334
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
動機不正

335
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
行為邪惡

336
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
這時他的祭品不謀與立的原因

337
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
做Sifus這樣記載

338
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
是非常對的

339
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
錯世紀第四章第七節

340
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
說得更加清楚

341
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
你若行得好

342
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
豈不謀與立呢

343
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
你若行得不好

344
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
罪就復在你面前

345
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
約翰一書第三章十二節

346
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
更加這樣說

347
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
因為他自己的行為是惡的

348
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
即是該人

349
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
因為該人的行為是惡的

350
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,520
弟弟即是阿伯的行為是異的

351
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
所以很明顯神不如立

352
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
他的憲制

353
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
就是因為該人自己

354
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
本身就有問題

355
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
我們再來看看

356
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
錯世紀第四章第七節

357
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
說你若行得不好

358
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
罪就復在你面前

359
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
他別戀無理

360
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
你卻要制服他

361
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
該人的問題在哪裏

362
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
他不單不承認自己有罪

363
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
他不單不承認自己有罪

364
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
亦都不是因為這樣

365
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
而他加以控制內心那隻怪獸

366
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
亦都不是因為這樣

367
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
而他加以控制內心那隻怪獸

368
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
承認如何形容我們的警方

369
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
罪就復在你面前

370
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
罪就好似一頭野獸

371
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
一個crowding tiger

372
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
伏起心門

373
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
分分鐘出來吞噬我們

374
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
分分鐘出來吞噬我們

375
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
我諗我們每一個人都經歷過這個引誘

376
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
我諗我們每一個人都經歷過這個引誘

377
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
在我們內心裏面

378
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
無論是憤怒啦、嫉妒啦、貪婪啦、息慾啦、貪念啦

379
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
無論是憤怒啦、嫉妒啦、貪婪啦、息慾啦、貪念啦

380
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
就好似野獸一樣

381
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
伏在我們心底裏面

382
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
我們要控制他

383
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
如果你唔控制佢嘅時候

384
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
任由佢吞噬

385
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
問題就嚟啦

386
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,520
該人唔能夠控制佢嘅憤怒

387
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
佢嘅嫉妒

388
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
第八節就話

389
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
該人與佢兄弟阿伯說話

390
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
二人正喺田間

391
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
該人起嚟打他兄弟阿伯

392
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
打他殺了

393
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
所以我哋要記得

394
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
人之所以唔開心

395
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
唔幸福嘅三大原因

396
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,520
第一

397
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
佢冇錯,呢個咪就該人嘅問題

398
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
第二

399
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
應該主義,神應該係預立我嘅公物嘅

400
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
應該主義

401
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
第三就窒道

402
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
唔能夠控制住內心

403
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
嗰種嘅猛獸

404
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
就因為咁樣,冇咗信

405
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
唔承認自己嘅罪

406
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
亦都唔去到上帝面前求

407
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
憐憫得憐心

408
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
於是就被神拒絕咗

409
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
呢個係

410
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
第一個元素

411
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
我哋再睇睇信嘅第二個元素

412
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
信唔單止係

413
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
睇到自己有罪

414
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
承認有罪

415
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
佢更加需要完全嘅委身

416
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
我哋睇一睇第十一章

417
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
第四節

418
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
另外一句

419
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
因著信,上帝就稱他為儀

420
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
聖經係咁講法

421
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
因此

422
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
便得了稱儀的見證

423
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
就是神指他禮物

424
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
作的見證

425
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
中文嘅譯本

426
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
有啲不倫不類

427
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
咩叫得了稱儀的見證呢?

428
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
咩叫他禮物

429
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
作的見證呢?

430
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
新譯本

431
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
顯然係簡單了當

432
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
新譯本點譯法

433
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
他被上帝稱許為儀人

434
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
為什麼

435
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
他被神稱許為儀人呢?

436
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
是因為他越納

437
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
他的共民

438
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
我哋就詳細嚟睇一睇

439
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
阿伯嘅憲制

440
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
係一個乜嘢嘅憲制

441
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
首先我要了解一件事

442
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
希伯羅書話畀你聽

443
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
上帝稱阿伯為儀

444
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
係因為

445
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
佢嘅憲制

446
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
唔係因為佢嘅本性或者行為

447
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
上帝唔係話

448
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
我查過啦,你兩人嘅檔幹

449
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
我睇一清清楚咗啦

450
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
我哋睇出你哋為人

451
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
你係好人阿伯

452
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
你係儀人,所以呢

453
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
我就越納你

454
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
你係個個人,係壞人,係罪人

455
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
所以我唔越納佢啦

456
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
呢個唔係聖經裏面所講嘅喎

457
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
第四節講得好清楚

458
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
得意嘅見證

459
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
究竟得意嘅見證人指咩?

460
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
係指佢因著

461
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
信所獻上嘅禮物

462
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
所以上帝係因為

463
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
阿伯所獻嘅禮物

464
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
而稱得為儀

465
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
而唔係因為阿伯嘅為人

466
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
同佢嘅本性而稱得為儀

467
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
世上聖經話明,世上一個二人也沒有

468
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
阿伯又係罪人

469
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
個人亦都係罪人

470
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
所以係同佢哋嘅行為

471
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
無關係嘅

472
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
而係同佢嘅獻祭有關係

473
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
究竟

474
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
有伯所獻嘅祭有咩特色

475
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
以至可以被稱為儀呢

476
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
就好似四章第四節所講

477
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
佢話

478
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
佢所獻嘅

479
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
是羊群中投身的

480
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
是獻上嘅羔羊

481
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
羔羊係動物

482
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
係獻祭

483
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
係要傳言將羊羔獻上

484
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
而且係一個

485
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
有血嘅動物

486
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
喺猶太人觀念裏面血係代表生命

487
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
伊伯羅書大九章二十

488
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
以至就講得好清楚,若不流血

489
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
罪不得赦免,尼米記第十七章

490
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
十一節就講過話

491
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
流血就等於贖罪

492
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
所以阿伯

493
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
獻上羊羔

494
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
係一種贖罪嘅表現

495
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
我喺度稍為提一提

496
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
一個有趣嘅

497
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
一個事件

498
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
喺中國嘅上古歷史裏面

499
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
最早期嘅宗教活動

500
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
唔係占卜

501
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
唔係文化,而係獻祭

502
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
相傳遺留立黎嘅

503
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
甲骨文唔少

504
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
嘅

505
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
獻祭嗰啲

506
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
嘅獸骨

507
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
唔少喺甲骨裏面都提到

508
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
獻祭同埋應罪

509
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
譬如我哋睇上帝

510
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
個帝字

511
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
係一個象形文字

512
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
下面係一個祭壇

513
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
上面一點就係個煙植上

514
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
傳言嘅獻上意思

515
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
阿伯嘅獻祭就係

516
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
應罪被閱立

517
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
而稱為異

518
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
今日我哋要知道

519
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
嗰隻被宰割嘅羔羊

520
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
就係耶穌基督

521
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
係因為佢嘅血

522
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
我哋嘅罪得以赦免

523
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
係因爲信而被稱為辭

524
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
仲有

525
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
阿伯嘅獻祭

526
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
唔單止係屬罪祭

527
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
而且係一個傳言嘅獻上

528
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
上帝唔係就叫佢

529
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
你獻羊腩啦

530
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
你獻羊腿啦

531
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
唔係係傳言整隻羊都獻喺壇上

532
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
嗰個人

533
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
唔係傳言嘅獻上

534
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
神今日

535
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
亦都叫我哋

536
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
唔係獻上身外物

537
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
而係將我哋整個生命都獻上

538
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
好似羅馬書第十一節

539
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
將身體獻上當作戶制

540
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
是你所當然的

541
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
信係傳言嘅獻上

542
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
正如你結婚嘅時候

543
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
你唔係淨係一部分

544
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
先至嫁畀對方

545
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
或者娶咗對方

546
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
而係你整個生命獻上

547
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
我諗到有啲人信耶穌

548
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
唔係傳言獻上

549
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
蘇印佩喺側勁嗰本書

550
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
提到佢都見到

551
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
佢就咁話

552
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
你叫我去禮拜堂嗎

553
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
我去

554
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
你叫我捐錢呢

555
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
我亦都捐

556
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
你叫我去探訪

557
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
去斜人呢

558
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
我亦都願意去做幫人

559
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
好事嚟嘅

560
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
但你叫我生命嘅主權交畀上帝

561
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
叫我將生命嘅主權交畀耶穌

562
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
佢叫我去邊度

563
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
我就去邊度呢

564
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
咁樣我就有保留啦

565
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
咁呢個係咪一個真正嘅信呢

566
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
第二個元素

567
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
就係信係完全嘅

568
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
偉身

569
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
最後我哋睇睇第三個

570
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
信嘅元素

571
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
信係超越死亡

572
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
信

573
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
我哋睇到係承認自己有罪同決意

574
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
信係將我哋嘅生命

575
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
傳言獻上

576
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
而第三個特色呢

577
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
就係十一章第四節講

578
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
佢雖然死了

579
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
但仍舊說話

580
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
我哋覺得奇怪

581
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
點解死咗仲可以說話呢

582
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
而更奇怪嘅呢

583
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
說話呢個字呢

584
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
係希伯羅書

585
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
希臘文裏面係一個

586
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
present continuous tense

587
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
即係儒阿伯雖然死咗

588
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
但佢仍然喺度說話

589
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
究竟佢向邊個說話

590
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
最低我哋睇到第一

591
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
佢向神說話

592
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
四章第十節話你兄弟的血有聲音

593
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
地裏向我哀告

594
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
換句話講神係唔係聾嘅

595
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
唔係啞嘅唔係盲嘅

596
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
佢係有公義嘅

597
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
阿伯

598
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
嘅哀告嘅聲音

599
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
直達到上帝嗰度

600
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
同樣今日都係

601
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
我哋哀告嘅聲音

602
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
係直達到上帝嗰度

603
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
第二

604
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
若伯嘅說話

605
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
亦都向該忍恕

606
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
第四章十一節呢地開了口

607
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
從你手裏

608
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
接受你兄弟的血

609
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
現在你必從者地受咒咒

610
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
阿伯嘅聲音

611
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
係到個地

612
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
山水村

613
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
一直向該忍

614
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
控訴走無可走

615
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
走無可走

616
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
原來阿伯嘅聲音

617
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
係一直

618
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
向住該忍嘅良心

619
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
係細說

620
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
以至去到

621
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
係目就座

622
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
第三

623
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
阿伯嘅說話

624
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
亦都向我哋說話

625
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
阿伯就好似希伯來書第十二章

626
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
第一節所提到嗰啲嘅見證人

627
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
而同雲彩地

628
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
圍住我哋

629
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
人生就好似跑呢條長跑一樣

630
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
當我哋跑路嘅時候

631
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
有好多好似

632
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
若伯好似阿伯咁嘅見證人

633
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
喺側邊同我哋打氣

634
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
加油加油

635
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
唔好放棄

636
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
因著信

637
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
我哋就戰勝死亡

638
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
因著信我哋就有永生嘅

639
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
盼望

640
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
阿伯今日仍然活著

641
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
活喺主耶穌基督懷裏面

642
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
一直喺我哋嘅心裏面

643
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
做見證做鼓勵

644
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
加油嘅工作

645
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
但相反嚟講

646
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
嗰個人好似仍然活著

647
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
其實佢係死了

648
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
死係咩意思

649
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
完全隔絕

650
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
完全分離

651
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
我諗到存在主義有個大師

652
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
講過一個故事當一個人死咗之後

653
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
佢醒嚟話

654
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
咁靚呀呢間房靜一靜

655
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
咁舒服

656
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
無理由呢個係地獄

657
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
去諗下

658
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
可能

659
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
呢個後診室

660
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
你喺隔離間房你就知道

661
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
嗰啲係刀山油鍋牛鬼蛇神

662
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
就喺嗰度啦

663
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
就唔好理啦

664
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
橫店臨死嘅時候咁辛苦

665
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
而家咁舒服咁靚靜

666
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
等下一日

667
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
等下一個月

668
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
等下一年無人無溝通

669
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
無牛鬼蛇神

670
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
佢突然間醒咗

671
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
呢個就係地獄呀

672
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
阿伯雖然死

673
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
仍舊說話

674
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
仍然有關係無斷絕

675
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
但係嗰個人點呀

676
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
佢死了

677
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
一個人係被

678
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
隔絕係一件好痛苦

679
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
好痛苦嘅事

680
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
係今次個COVID-19

681
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
嘅疫症

682
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
其實最大嘅傷害

683
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
當然死亡

684
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
係好大傷害

685
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
但係有好多人仍生存

686
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
被隔絕

687
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
可以話係精神情緒上

688
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
受到極嚴重嘅損傷

689
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
隔絕

690
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
我哋再嚟

691
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
睇睇第四章十二節

692
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
聖經點講呢

693
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
你終地

694
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
地不再給你效力

695
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
你必流離飄蕩在地上

696
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
個人嘅後果

697
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
就係隔絕

698
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
唔單止係同神隔絕

699
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
同大地隔絕

700
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
同人隔絕

701
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
流離飄蕩無家可歸

702
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
無安全感

703
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
第十四節

704
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
呢一個個人就話

705
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
如今趕住我離開者地

706
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
依知不見理面

707
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
我必流離飄蕩在地上

708
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
凡遇見我都必殺我

709
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
佢會係一個恐懼裏面

710
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
抗議神

711
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
神無保障佢

712
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
於是神就話好

713
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
凡殺個人都必遭報七倍

714
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
耶和話比個人

715
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
立左個記號

716
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
但呢

717
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
死咗先立個記號

718
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
有咩用

719
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
我要求嘅係你個保障

720
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
唔係呢啲嘅保障

721
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
於是佢就離開咗

722
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
耶和話嘅面

723
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
離開咗耶和話之後點

724
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
佢就去到伊甸園嘅東面

725
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
叫做羅德之地

726
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
喺羅德之地聖經話畀佢聽

727
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
佢做咗兩件事第一去生個仔

728
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
起名叫做以樂

729
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
第二佢見咗一座城

730
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
又起名叫做以樂

731
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
以樂係咩意思

732
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
喺希伯萊文

733
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
佢意思就係

734
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
再一次創造第二次創造

735
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
re-creation

736
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
second creation

737
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
佢拒絕上帝畀佢嘅永恆

738
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
佢拒絕上帝畀佢嘅保障

739
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
佢要自己親手

740
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
做一個永恆

741
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
生個仔只係有孫孫

742
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
有子子子孫孫

743
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
無窮盡也

744
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
呢個就係佢嘅永恆

745
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
佢要建立自己嘅保障

746
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
一座城城就係保障

747
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
佢完全冇諗到

748
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
佢個仔係邊度生

749
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
佢個城係邊度建

750
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
就係羅德

751
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
羅德嘅字希伯萊文意思就係

752
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
流離飄蕩

753
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
佢係流離飄蕩嘅地方

754
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
想結束呢個流離飄蕩

755
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
中到頭來

756
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
還是流離飄蕩

757
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
耶穌講得好啱

758
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
人要保存自己嘅生命

759
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
必喪掉生命

760
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
人為我喪掉生命

761
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
必得著保存佢嘅生命

762
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
信第三個元素

763
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
就信

764
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
打比我哋真正嘅盼望

765
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
永生

766
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
死後仍然說話

767
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
如果唔信嘅時候企度去建立

768
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
我哋嘅王國我哋嘅安全感

769
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
我哋嘅保障結果係

770
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
流離飄蕩

771
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
死喺曠野當中

772
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
活在恐懼當中

773
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
呢個就係該人

774
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
人生嘅寫照

775
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
你同我決擇係乜嘢

776
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
我哋決擇

777
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
係阿伯咁嘅

778
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
人生

779
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
就亦話該人嘅人生

780
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
求主幫助我哋

781
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,520
喺我哋前面

782
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
只有兩條路

783
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
一條係寬嘅路有好多人走

784
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
但呢條路係

785
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
引到滅亡

786
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
一條係窄嘅路

787
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
但呢個

788
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
呢條路係引

789
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
引致到永生

790
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
今日你同我哋嘅決擇

791
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
係乜嘢呢

792
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
呢條窄嘅路係耶穌基督

793
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
相信耶穌基督

794
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
願意打開我哋嘅心門

795
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
接受耶穌基督

796
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
喺我哋嘅生命裏面

797
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
獻上我哋嘅祭

798
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
咁嘅時候

799
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
你嘅人生

800
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
就一定會多姿多彩

801
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
同心低頭

有望有愛

求你就藉著你話語去提醒

807
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
幫助我哋

808
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520

我哋今日土葛乜係奉耶穌基督命求
