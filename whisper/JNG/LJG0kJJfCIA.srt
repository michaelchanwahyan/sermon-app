1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 A while ago, a colleague, who is actually half my boss, retired.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 He gave me a book titled "It is OK to be Average".

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 It means, "It's OK to be average".

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 If your boss gave you a book like this, what would you think?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 At first, I was wondering why there was a book like this.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Because in university, you are usually told to be outstanding, to be number one, to get a certain award.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 But why did he give me a book titled "It is OK to be Average"?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Does that mean I am really average?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I opened the book and found it quite interesting.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 It was written by an old Chinese from Singapore,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 telling his life experience.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 He told a story that we are all familiar with,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 a story about a ugly duckling.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Do you remember the story about the ugly duckling?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Maybe some of you who are older would have heard of it.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 He said that there was a small duckling,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 black, very ugly.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 After it was born, its parents went missing.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Then, it was very sad to see a group of white ducklings.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Its mother took the ducklings with her and walked along.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It followed the ducklings, hoping to find a mate.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But it was ugly, so it was always laughed at.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 "Why are you so ugly? Everyone else is white, but you are black and ugly."

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 It was very sad and cried, and complained,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 "Why am I so ugly?"

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Finally, as it grew up, it realized that it was a swan.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It was more beautiful than the other ducks,

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 and it could fly higher than them.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 It was a beautiful black swan,

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 although it was a black swan.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We are most afraid of white swans,

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 but we were afraid of black swans.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 This story is very simple.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It tells us that sometimes we feel that we are worse than others.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 We feel that we are not very special,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 or that we do not have special talents,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 or that we are not better than others.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But how does God see us?

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Or what kind of people does God want to use?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Are all the people He wants to use smart and capable?

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Do they all have a lot of degrees, books, and talents?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Do they all have power and money?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I remember the first chapter of the Bible in the Old Testament.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It says, "Have you ever thought that among you people who are in the dream,

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 there are not many people who are wise,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 who have a good eye for the flesh?"

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It means that you are not particularly smart.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 How many disciples have received the Bell of the Lord?

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I don't think there are many.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 It says, "There are not many people who are wise,

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 who have power,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 who have money,

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 and who are not very noble."

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But God chose these people to serve Him.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 This is the topic I will talk about today.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 It is okay to be an ordinary Christian.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It may not be a bad thing to be an ordinary Christian.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 The Bible reminds us that God does not have to choose the best,

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 or at least in the eyes of man,

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He can choose the best,

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 the one with the most talents, the one with the most degrees,

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 or the one who was born into a very dark family.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 God does not have to choose such people to serve Him.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Instead, He chose ordinary people.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 What for?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Here, He says a very special reason.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 He says, "So that you will not boast,

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 that because I am very good,

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I can do these things for God.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You cannot boast that because I am very good,

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I have read a lot of books,

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 so I have such achievements,

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I can be a leader."

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Let's look at some examples in the Bible.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Before talking about the examples,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 how do we define what is "ordinary"?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 What is "not outstanding"?

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Maybe in our eyes, ordinary people are those who are not famous,

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 who do not have much degrees,

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 who do not have many English letters in their names.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Many people have written a lot of things,

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 from middle school to university,

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 and they have written a lot of English letters.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 The more letters they have, the better they are.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 God does not think these things are important.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 He says, "In God's perspective,

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 availability matters more than ability."

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Does that mean you are really prepared to be used?

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Availability, is it that you can respond at any time,

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 and respond at any time,

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 is more important than your ability?

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Availability is more important than ability.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I want to share with you a few simple,

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 very obvious examples.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 When Moses was called by God on Mount Sinai,

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 to lead hundreds of thousands of Israelites out of Egypt,

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 what was Moses' first reaction?

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 He said, "God, have you ever thought that

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I am actually a very talkative person?

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I am even a bit of a talker.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 How can I have the ability to convince Pharaoh

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 to release hundreds of thousands of Israelites?

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 How can I use my ability to convince those people

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 to follow me into the desert,

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 so that they may not be able to eat,

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 live a good life,

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 or even die in the wilderness?"

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 God said, "Actually, I don't need you to be very talkative.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 What do you have?

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 You have the crutch in your hand.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 This is what I am giving you.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 You can use this crutch

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 to carry the words I am giving you."

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Then you can do it.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 in the next 40 years.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 He was not a very good person.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 He was like the Egyptian prince in his cartoons.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 He was very handsome and good at fighting.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But he was not a politician.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 He was not a very talkative person either.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 The second example is David.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You may have seen this statue in Italy.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 He was very handsome with a little curly hair.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 He was very big.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 He was a boy.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 He was holding a rope in his hand.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 The rope was wrapped around a stone ball.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 It was said that David used a small stone

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 to defeat Goliath.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But when he was about to go to war,

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 he said to himself,

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 "When I go to war with the Phoenicians,

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 people will laugh at me.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Even his father will laugh at him.

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 What's wrong with you?

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 You are not a soldier.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 You don't know how to fight.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You are so small.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 You are not a person who can fight with a giant.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Even his father thought,

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 "You are just a little boy.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 How can you go to war?"

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 He didn't think he was so talented.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 As a result, he defeated a giant with a small stone.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Of course, there are many explanations

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 as to why a giant was defeated by a small stone.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 There is a very strange explanation in medicine.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 If you haven't heard it, I'll tell you now.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 In medicine, there is a symptom called "Giant Syndrome".

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It is caused by a huge amount of hormones

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 in the lower brain.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 The people there are very big.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Although they are very big,

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 they can't fight.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Because their muscles are actually broken.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They are not really strong.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 They can't fight.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 In addition, there is a thing in the lower brain.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 They look at things in a dreamy way.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 They see two shadows.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So when they see a small stone flying over,

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 they can't avoid it.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They can't avoid it.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They can't avoid it.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 They can't avoid it.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 This is a joke in medicine.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 No matter what,

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 God used a child who was very blind.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 A boy with a wooden sheep.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 He used a very blind weapon

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 to defeat a giant of Phileas.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 This is not the most capable and wisest choice in the world.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 No.

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 It is a choice that everyone thinks is impossible.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 What is closer is that

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Jesus' mother, Maria,

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 was a person who,

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 when the angel told her,

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 "You will be pregnant

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 and become the mother of the Savior."

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 She asked, "Who am I?"

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 "I am just a woman, a woman."

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 "I just cook at home."

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 "I don't know how to do anything."

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 "I am just a housewife."

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Today, many of our sisters may say,

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 "I just cook. I just take care of the kids."

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 "How can I do such a great thing?"

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 God chose a woman who had no degree

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 to become Jesus' mother.

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 What is her greatest advantage?

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 She said, "If you choose me,

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I am willing to do this."

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 She was accepting,

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 convincing, and willing.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 God made her

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 a baby girl

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 who was born from her own womb.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Isn't this a wonderful choice?

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But I think another wonderful thing is

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Jesus himself with the twelve disciples.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 None of them

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 looked very good in the eyes of people,

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 especially those with talent.

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Yes, there was a "tax collector".

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 He was not well-liked by people.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Others were fishermen,

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 farmers,

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 and even those who were protesting

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 in the streets of the opposition parties.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Jesus chose such people

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 as his disciples.

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 None of them had a degree,

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 not a Ph.D.

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Although Paul was the most wise

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 and learned man,

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 he was a Roman.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 He read a lot of Roman philosophy and law.

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 But he was the one

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 who wrote the Bible.

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 God chose those

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 who were not particularly wise.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So all these examples

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 show that God did not choose

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 the best among the people in the Bible.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Of course, there are some who are not the same.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 For example, Daniel was a handsome and smart man.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 This is a little different.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Or even as I said,

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Paul was a very learned man.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 But most of them were not chosen

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 because they were not wise,

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 not of a high status,

236
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 not of special ability.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 They were chosen to be

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 the ones who thought they were smart.

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 He chose the wise people

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 to be the ones who were wise.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 He chose the weak people

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 to be the ones who were strong.

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 When I did not do well in my previous exams,

244
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 I liked to watch this Bible.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I told the first one,

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 "You are not very good.

247
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 God chose me.

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Maybe you are not very good."

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Are we satisfied today

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 with our lack of wisdom and ability?

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And then we continue to make

252
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 an ordinary faith.

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And then every week,

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 we sing a few songs,

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 and then we eat a few things.

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And then we go back to our normal life.

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 We are very happy.

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 We are an ordinary believer.

259
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Is this our life?

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Well, I believe God

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 in the examples we saw just now,

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 showed us one thing.

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 You can be a very ordinary person.

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 But God can turn you

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 into an extraordinary leader.

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 He can make you

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 an extraordinary believer.

268
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 As long as you wait until that day,

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 and you are ready to wait

270
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 until that day comes,

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 how can we go from being ordinary

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 to being extraordinary?

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 How can we be used by God?

274
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Today, because I don't have enough time,

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 there are many lights here

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 in English.

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But the Bible,

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 as the brother just translated it for me,

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 is in Chinese.

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 It's really good.

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 There are seven things

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 you can prepare

283
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 to make your ordinary

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 become extraordinary

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 in God.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 First,

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 you have to dedicate your heart to God.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 The Bible says we should

289
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 devote our heart, our mind, and our spirit

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 to God who loves you.

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 You have to love Him.

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 You have to dedicate your heart to Him.

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I am willing to do so.

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Just like a lover,

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 a wife and a husband,

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 I am willing to do whatever you ask me to do.

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I will devote my heart, my spirit, and my spirit

298
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 to love Him.

299
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And every day, through our reading the Bible,

300
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 our prayer,

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 it's like talking to your lover.

302
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Such a close relationship.

303
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 One day,

304
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 God will show us.

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 After this relationship,

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 you will be like

307
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 a prophet.

308
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 When he sees an image,

309
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 God finally appears before him.

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 The highest Jehovah

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 sits high on the temple.

312
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 His clothes are under the bed.

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 The temple is covered with angels and salafis

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 singing,

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 "Glory, glory, glory to the Jehovah of the angels."

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 When he sees such an image,

317
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 he was a normal person.

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 God suddenly said,

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 "Who can I show my love to?

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Who is willing to go for me?"

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 He immediately said,

322
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 "I am here. Please show me your love."

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 He was ready.

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 He was willing to make himself available.

325
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 He was willing to show himself.

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 This is a very important...

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But you must have a close relationship with God

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 before you say this.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 "I am willing to do this for you.

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Please show me your love."

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Not everyone can say that.

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 It must be someone you love very much.

333
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Your wife.

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You love her very much.

335
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 What does she ask you to do?

336
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 You say, "I am willing. Please show me your love."

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 How many husbands say,

338
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 "You and your wife ask me to show you my love."

339
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 "You ask me to go shopping."

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 "You ask me to show you my love."

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 "You ask me to take my children to this and that."

342
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 "You ask me to show you my love."

343
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 We rarely say that.

344
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 But if you really love that person,

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 you are willing to do what you are willing to

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 for him, for your wife, for your children.

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Besides these two things,

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 the third thing is to pay attention to...

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Even if you don't have any special skills,

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 you should look at what you have in your hands

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 that can be used by God.

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 It's like Moses.

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 He didn't have anything. He only had a stick.

354
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 He had a spear.

355
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 But that spear was very powerful.

356
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 It could turn into a snake.

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 The snake could turn into a spear.

358
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And when it hit the water,

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 it could separate the sea.

360
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 The Red Sea was split in half

361
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 and let people cross it.

362
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 The things in his hands were not very special.

363
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But they were all tools.

364
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 David's spear was smaller.

365
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 It had a stone and a rope.

366
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But that was also something that could be used by God.

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 As long as he is willing to use you,

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 you are willing to follow.

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Today, some of us have a group of sisters

370
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 who sang very well.

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 But you may say, "I don't have that voice."

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 "I can hear someone singing very well."

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 "Our voices are very different."

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 No. You are willing to use your voice.

375
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Or you are willing to use your words.

376
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 You may speak a few languages.

377
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Then you may be used by God.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The Chaozhou dialect, Hakka dialect,

379
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 and Cantonese,

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 you may be used by God.

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Do you know what's in your hands?

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 It may not be a very powerful weapon.

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 But when God wants to use you,

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 it becomes something that can be used.

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 The Bible says, "Those who are faithful in small things

386
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 will be faithful in great things."

387
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Jesus said, "When I chose people,

388
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I chose those who were faithful in small things."

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 When you cook, are you faithful?

390
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 When you buy food, are you not being discouraged?

391
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 When I was a doctor,

392
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I thought, "I have seen such a normal disease."

393
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I have seen a patient in such a small clinic.

394
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 But are you faithful in small things?

395
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 If so, God may put you in a big thing one day

396
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 to show His ability to do great things.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 So in our small things every day,

398
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 we must be faithful,

399
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 and be faithful to God.

400
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Sometimes God will transform you,

401
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 prepare you,

402
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 so that you are more suitable for great things.

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 These kinds of training are usually done

404
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 when you are most unhappy.

405
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I will tell you an example later.

406
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 After I was a doctor for three years,

407
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I decided to leave my position

408
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and go to Canada to do a doctorate.

409
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 But I was not selected or recruited to Harvard

410
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 to be a Canadian.

411
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I went to a place called Calgary,

412
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 where I did a PhD.

413
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I asked myself,

414
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 "What did I do wrong?

415
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Why was I selected to be trained

416
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 in such a small and unpopular place?"

417
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 In such a small place,

418
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 I trained myself how to live independently,

419
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 how to think independently,

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 and not necessarily follow the boss' instructions.

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I trained myself to live in a cold,

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 and unpopular environment.

423
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Often, when we think that life is a low,

424
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 and encountering a lot of difficulties,

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 God is preparing you,

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 preparing you to do something big.

427
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 God is preparing you to live a life

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 where you can be a living testimony.

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 God did not choose us because we have a shirt,

430
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 but because our daily life is like a document

431
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 that proves that we are loyal to Him.

432
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Although it is a small thing,

433
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 we are loyal to Him.

434
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 The gentleman behind me is very good.

435
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Every time I turn around,

436
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 the screen will turn to show me

437
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 what I wrote.

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Thank you.

439
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Lastly,

440
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 the seventh thing to note and prepare is

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 that you must still have a humble heart.

442
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 A humble heart.

443
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It is a very easy mistake.

444
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 When you have a little bit of success,

445
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 you will think, "I can do it."

446
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 When you reach the first level,

447
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 you will realize that you are not bad.

448
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 But this is the time when we fall easily

449
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 because we lack humility.

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Lack of humility is because we know

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 that we can stand still today

452
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 because we are like a grapevine

453
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 that is tied to a branch.

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Jesus said that if the grapevine is not tied to the tree,

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 you will not be able to bear fruit.

456
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 You will not be able to continue to play your role.

457
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So be humble and...

458
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I must not turn my face to you.

459
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Be humble and dependent.

460
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 He said that you must rely on Him

461
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and be humble.

462
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 The seven things...

463
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 You don't remember which seven things I mentioned.

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Usually, we only mention two things.

465
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 What is the first thing?

466
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 The first thing is that you must love Him

467
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 with all your heart and all your mind.

468
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Then you must be willing to be called.

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Like Isaiah,

470
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 "Lord, I am in this place. Please show me."

471
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Then you must see what you have

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 and what you can use.

473
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Then you must be loyal in small things.

474
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 When you are in trouble,

475
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 you must accept His training and His teaching.

476
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Finally, you must use your daily life

477
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 as a witness

478
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 and become your true friend.

479
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Finally, when you have a little bit of success,

480
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 you must continue to be humble

481
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 and depend on Him.

482
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 You must be humble.

483
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 This is what I think.

484
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 How can you make your ordinary life

485
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 become extraordinary?

486
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Today, I want to share with you

487
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 a photo that I haven't shown to anyone for a long time.

488
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 This is me.

489
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I grew up in an ordinary family.

490
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 The one sitting in the middle is me.

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 The one holding me is my younger brother

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 and my cousin.

493
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Our family is not a rich family.

494
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 It is definitely not a rich family.

495
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 My grandfather was a car repairman.

496
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 He was a sprayer.

497
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 He opened a small workshop in Wanchai, Hong Kong.

498
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 My mother was a small employee in a bank.

499
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It is strange that she worked in a big bank.

500
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 There is a big bank in Hong Kong, UOB.

501
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 She was a small employee.

502
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 She only studied until she graduated from primary school.

503
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 My father was a shopkeeper

504
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 who sold glasses.

505
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 He was a very unremarkable person.

506
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I still remember when I was young,

507
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 I lived in Wanchai.

508
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 I could smell the smell of car spray.

509
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 In Wanchai, Lohkak,

510
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 there were many bars.

511
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 The US military kept going to Vietnam to fight.

512
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 After 6 weeks of fighting,

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 he would come to Hong Kong and drink a big glass of wine in Wanchai.

514
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Then he would go to the bar.

515
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 You can imagine what he did.

516
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I grew up in this kind of red-light district.

517
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 I think I am not particularly good-looking.

518
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Although I am a little good-looking,

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I am not particularly good-looking.

520
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I am not particularly smart.

521
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I am really good at studying.

522
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I remember when I was in middle school,

523
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 I took the first exam.

524
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 I got 31 points out of 40 students.

525
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Although I didn't get to the end,

526
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I was already very close.

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 But when I went from the first grade to the seventh grade,

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I was the second or third in the class.

529
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I was slowly rising.

530
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 I am not a very good athlete.

531
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 I have never won a gold medal.

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 You can see in this photo,

533
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 I am playing badminton with a friend.

534
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 You can see that he is not good at playing badminton.

535
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I am not a very talented person.

536
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 At least in the eyes of a Westerner,

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I am not a very talented person.

538
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 When I became a doctor,

539
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I was learning how to help people take their position.

540
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 In the past, you had to look down like this.

541
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 You had to look at a micro-lens to see what was in the position.

542
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 It was very difficult.

543
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 But the problem was that my boss didn't like me.

544
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 He didn't like me because he thought my life was too smooth.

545
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 He said that I passed the exam right away.

546
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Everything seemed to be going well,

547
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 but I had to give you some difficulties.

548
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 So when I was training,

549
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I was doing my gastroenterology,

550
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I was very unhappy and difficult.

551
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I had to resign my job and go to Canada to do my PhD.

552
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So in the three years in Canada,

553
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I kept asking myself if I had made the wrong decision.

554
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 I didn't want a doctor's job.

555
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I went to Canada to be a student.

556
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 The salary I got was less than a third of what I got as a doctor.

557
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 It was a cold place.

558
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 It was a very difficult environment for me to grow up.

559
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 The worst thing was that when I got my PhD,

560
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 it was 1992,

561
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 when Canada was just entering the country's economic downturn.

562
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I wrote ten letters to ten different universities and hospitals in Canada.

563
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 None of them replied to me,

564
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 saying that they could hire me to continue working there.

565
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 I thought, "Oh no, I'm graduating and I'm unemployed.

566
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I can't go back to work in the hospital."

567
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 At that moment, Hong Kong called me and said,

568
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 "Your boss has left.

569
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Do you still want to come back to work?"

570
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 That's how I came back to Hong Kong in 1992.

571
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 I was working at a Chinese university.

572
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I thought I would be working there for a year or two,

573
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 because I thought I wouldn't stay in Hong Kong for long.

574
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 But I worked there for 35 years.

575
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 It was a completely unexpected arrangement.

576
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 As I worked there, things started to improve.

577
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I started to see some achievements.

578
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 The articles we published were viewed by more people.

579
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I trained more dentists and became a team.

580
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Ten years later, in 2003,

581
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 a big change occurred.

582
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Everyone remembers SARS.

583
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 It was a completely unprepared environment.

584
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 When we thought we had some achievements,

585
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 God gave us a surprise.

586
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 It turned out that what we knew was very limited.

587
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 We thought we had a lot of medical skills and experience.

588
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 But when a new virus appeared,

589
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 we were completely at a loss.

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 I remember telling myself and the reporters,

591
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 "I feel like I'm carrying 100 eggs in my heart.

592
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I can't let it fall to the ground."

593
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Each egg is a patient of mine.

594
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 25% of the patients are doctors and nurses.

595
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I don't want to see any life

596
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 because we don't know how to deal with it.

597
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 So we lost these precious lives.

598
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 At that moment, we prayed together and told God,

599
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 "Please don't let my ignorance

600
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 make us abandon a life,

601
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 a precious life."

602
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 At that moment, the whole room,

603
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 the whole room of my office was filled with Christians.

604
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Because we really had a lot of difficulties in our hearts.

605
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 We didn't know how to solve them.

606
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 But when we felt we were the most incompetent,

607
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 when we felt we lacked wisdom,

608
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 when we were the weakest,

609
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 God showed His strength.

610
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 A miracle happened.

611
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 We started to pray for each patient in the ward every day.

612
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Then we started to see the restoration.

613
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Then there was the story of Sars.

614
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 You may have heard of it.

615
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 In this transition,

616
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 people thought, "You can be a leader.

617
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Why don't you do more leadership work?"

618
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 In 2008, when Sichuan had a big earthquake,

619
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 I took a group of classmates to Wenchuan,

620
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 the place where the earthquake was the most severe.

621
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We went to the town.

622
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 You can see the bell is broken.

623
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Many buildings have collapsed.

624
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 The buildings next to us were originally three-story buildings,

625
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 but now they are on the ground.

626
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 At that time, I started to feel

627
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 that what I could do

628
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 or what God wanted me to do

629
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 was more than sitting in the office or in the door of the clinic to see the earthquake.

630
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 I can lead a group of students

631
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 to make them more useful people in society.

632
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I thought, although I was much older than them,

633
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 I was actually at the same age as their father,

634
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 but they didn't seem to give up on me and their generation.

635
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 They became my good friends.

636
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 So I became a principal.

637
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 It was a big surprise to become a principal.

638
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I had never studied education.

639
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 I only studied medicine.

640
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 I had never studied leadership or politics.

641
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 But I was completely surprised to become a principal.

642
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 In this surprise, I found that I had to face many problems every day.

643
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 I never imagined how to face them.

644
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Although everyone was very happy at the graduation ceremony,

645
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 the graduation ceremony of our university was the most terrifying day of the year.

646
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Because there were protests and demonstrations that day.

647
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Many reporters came to film our embarrassing scenes

648
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 and asked me some embarrassing questions.

649
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 So every year, November is my biggest worry.

650
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 I didn't know what would happen that day.

651
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 I didn't know what kind of surprises would happen that day.

652
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 I just passed by the principal's office for seven and a half years.

653
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 I don't know why I came to this place.

654
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 The story I just told you

655
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 is to show that I am a very honest person.

656
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 I am a very ordinary person.

657
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I am an ordinary person.

658
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 But just like you,

659
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 our ordinary can become God's extraordinary.

660
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Our weak can become God's manifestation of His ability.

661
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Our ignorant can become God's wisdom.

662
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Sister Ling, have you ever thought that

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 even if you are very ordinary,

664
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 as long as God is by your side,

665
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 as long as He is holding you in His hands,

666
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 one day you may do something great.

667
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Or even in the eyes of others,

668
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 it may not seem like a big deal.

669
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 But in His eyes, it seems like a big deal.

670
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 So today's Bible reminds us again

671
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 not to underestimate our own judgment.

672
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 He says, if God wants to choose,

673
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 He will choose those who are humble,

674
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 those who are ungrateful.

675
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 This is in Acts 4, verse 6.

676
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 He says He will resist those who are arrogant,

677
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 but will be kind to those who are humble.

678
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Then He says in Columbus' 12th chapter,

679
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 9th chapter,

680
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 "My grace is sufficient for you;

681
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 my power is more perfect in the body of the weak."

682
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 It is not about how much power we have.

683
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 It is not about our ability that counts.

684
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 It is about our availability.

685
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 We are willing to be used by God.

686
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 It is like the saying,

687
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 "Lord, I am here, please show me."

688
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Do you have this kind of mind today?

689
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Do not underestimate yourself as a housewife.

690
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Do not underestimate yourself as a...

691
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I am about to retire. I am in my teens.

692
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 I don't seem to have done anything great.

693
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Do not underestimate your own ability.

694
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Because in God's eyes, it is okay to be average.

695
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 He can make your average life

696
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 become a very un-average life.

697
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Let us bow our heads and pray.

698
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Heavenly Father, we thank you.

699
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Because our life is actually under your control,

700
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 within your plan.

701
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 We thank you because you allow us to enjoy

702
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 the growth and acceptance of your love.

703
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Although we are not many in ability,

704
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 not many in wisdom,

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 you have chosen the weak in this world,

706
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 called the wise, to be taken in.

707
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 You have also chosen the weak in this world,

708
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 called the strong to be taken in.

709
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 You have chosen us because we are humble.

710
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 We are one and the same.

711
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Until when you do great things,

712
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 we cannot overestimate ourselves.

713
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 What we overestimate is your ability.

714
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 We ask you to use each one of us well.

715
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 We are willing to cook like cooking vegetables.

716
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 I am here. Please show me.

717
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Listen to our prayer.

718
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 (Chinese)

719
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000

 (Chinese)
