00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Hello, brothers and sisters.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 Welcome to my teaching today.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,500
 Today I would like to share with you a topic called "Truth and Miracles".

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:22,000
 This topic is in Matthew 12, verses 22-42.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 In my last sermon, Jesus Christ asked me a question.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 "Have you ever read the book of Matthew?"

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 The last sermon was in the first third of Matthew 12.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Today's sermon is in the middle third of Matthew 12.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 First, please listen to the text I read today.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Matthew 12, verses 22-42.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It says, "At that time, a man led a blind and naked man to Jesus.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Jesus healed him, and Abba spoke and saw.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 The people were amazed and said, "Is this not the Son of David?"

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But the Pharisees heard and said, "This man speaks of the devil,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 because he is wearing the robe of the devil.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 "A nation must be united by self-interest.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 One nation must be united by self-interest.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 If Satan drives out Satan, it is a matter of self-interest.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 How can his nation be united?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I am wearing the robe of the devil.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Who are you wearing, you sons of the devil?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 They will be your judges.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I am wearing the robe of the devil.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Then the kingdom of God has come to you.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 How can a man enter the house of his enemy and take his possessions?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Unless he first binds the enemy,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 otherwise he cannot take his possessions.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Those who do not follow me are against me.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Those who do not repent with me are in the desert.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So I tell you,

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 all sins and blasphemy can be forgiven,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 but blasphemy cannot be forgiven.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But blasphemy against the Son of Man cannot be forgiven,

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 The second paragraph is in verse 33.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 You know what is good and what is bad.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Because you see what is good, you know what is bad.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 You are the wicked.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 How can you speak good words?

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Because the mouth of the heart is full of good words.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Good people speak good words from the good he has spoken.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Evil people speak evil words from the evil he has spoken.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I tell you, all the idle talk that people speak

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 must be brought to justice on the day of judgment.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Because if it is up to you, you will be just.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 But if it is up to you, you will be guilty.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 At that time, there were several people from the city of Valley of the Word who said to Jesus,

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 "Teacher, we want you to show us a miracle so that we can see it."

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Jesus answered them,

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 "The evil generation of man seeks to see the miracle.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Except for the miracle of the prophet Jonah,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 there is no miracle that they can see.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Jonah was in the desert for three days and three nights.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Similarly, the Son of Man will be in the earth for three days and three nights.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 At the time of judgment, you will be given the sin of the world.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Because you have not heard the prophecy of Jonah,

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 it will be changed.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 See, the greater is the law than Jonah.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 At the time of judgment, the queen of the south will rise and set the sin of the world.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Because she came from the earth,

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 she will hear Solomon's wise words.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 See, the greater is the law than Solomon.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Today I want to share this scripture with you.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 The last time I talked about the scripture,

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I mentioned Jesus Christ's invitation at the end of Matthew.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 He said, "Those who bear heavy burdens, come to me.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I will give you rest.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I am gentle and humble in my heart.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 You should learn from me.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 So that your hearts may be comforted.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 For my burden is light, and my burden is light."

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 In the last lecture, I divided the first one-third of Matthew 12

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 into three parts.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The main point is that Jesus' disciples were

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 accused of breaking the Sabbath by the Pharisees.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Jesus quoted David and Zizek to point out

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 that he is the eternal King of Kings,

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 and the eternal Great Zizek.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I also explained the focus of the Sabbath.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 The first point is that it doesn't matter what we can do or not do.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 The most important thing about the Sabbath is that there are two main points.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 The first point is that the grace of God allows people to have a rest.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 The second point is that when we have a rest,

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 we can get close to God, know God, worship God,

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 and reconcile with God.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 This is the most important.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 The real rest is to reconcile with God.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Because people are separated from God by sin.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Sin makes us unable to go directly to God.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 To truly rest, Jesus Christ as a Great Zizek,

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 and as a God who has no sin,

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 to atone for sin and solve the problem of sin.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So Jesus Christ used his own

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 cross to shed blood for us,

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 to bring us into the real rest,

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 which is to reconcile with God.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Also in the second chapter of the Bible,

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 in chapters 9-14, Jesus healed a man whose hand was dried.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 The Pharisees did not doubt the ability of Jesus to perform miracles.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But they knew that Jesus Christ could perform miracles,

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 but they did not respect him.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Instead, they hoped that Jesus would heal the man on the Sabbath,

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 as a weapon to accuse him,

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 and even to kill him.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 The author of Matthew 1, Sittu Matthew,

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 quoted Isaiah 42,

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 which says that Jesus Christ is the Lord chosen by God.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 He came to suffer,

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 to heal and help many in need.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 At the same time, he also brought this good news to the outside world.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 This is what happened in the prophecy of Isaiah.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Sittu Matthew pointed out that Jesus Christ is the Lord chosen by God.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 He is the Savior, Isaiah.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Today we will continue this passage,

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Matthew 22.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 If you look at the three chapters in the middle,

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I will divide them into three parts to explain.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 The first part is about the Pharisees slandering Jesus

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 by using the king and the disciples to drive out the devil.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 The second part is about the example of the tree and the fruit.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 The third part is about the Pharisees asking Jesus to perform a miracle again.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I want to emphasize that the miracle I want to talk about today

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 is a miracle that can be seen with the naked eye.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 For example, Jesus healed the man and drove the devil away.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 These are visible to the naked eye.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 All that God does can be regarded as a miracle.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 For example, the change of a man's mind and thoughts

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 from sin to righteousness is also a miracle.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 But the change of the inner heart cannot be seen.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 So the miracle I want to emphasize today is a miracle that can be seen with the naked eye.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 For example, the miracle of turning water into wine,

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 healing the sick and driving away the devil, etc.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 So I want everyone to understand.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 First, let's look at the first passage of the Bible.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 This passage is very special.

137
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 It is a very concise passage.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 At that time, someone brought a blind and mute man to Jesus.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Jesus healed him.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 The father could speak and see.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 There are three things in this passage.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 First, this man was blind and mute.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Jesus healed him, that is, drove the devil away.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 This blind and mute man could speak and see.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 When this happened, no one doubted that Jesus could perform a miracle and heal the sick and drive away the devil.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 When everyone noticed, there were two reactions.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 The 23rd chapter says, "Everyone was surprised.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 "Isn't this David's son?"

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So the first group of people who saw this miracle pointed to this man.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Could it be the Savior, Lezariah?

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Because in the Old Testament, when it comes to David's son,

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 it often refers to the future Savior in the Old Testament.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Lezariah means Savior.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 David's son.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Because the Old Testament says that the Savior of Israel is David's son.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 So David's son represents the Savior of Israel in the future.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 At the same time, another group of people, the Pharisees, saw this.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 They said, "This man drove the devil away.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 "Is it the devil, the king, the shepherd?"

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So today we want to see what evidence there is in the two names David's son and the Pharisees.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So that these people have two different ideas.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So the same thing happened, this miracle happened.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 No one doubted that it would be meaningful to Jesus to perform a miracle.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 The difference is pointing to which two people.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 One is pointing to Lezariah, the Savior.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 The other is the king of the devil.

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 First, we have to look at David's son.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Because in the Old Testament, there are several obvious things that will happen.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 First, the deaf will hear the words of the book.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 The blind can see.

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 The poor will rejoice because of the Lord's Word.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And the poor will be happy because of the victory of Israel.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I want you to pay attention to this.

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 When Isaiah mentioned Lezariah,

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 it was to cure the sick.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 But there is a purpose.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Because the deaf can hear is a method.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 It's not over yet.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 The real purpose is that the Savior came

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 to let the deaf hear the words of the book,

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 which is the Word of God.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 The blind can see.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Who can see?

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 God.

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So when Lezariah came,

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 the Savior came,

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 he was a miracle worker.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 But this miracle worker is not the purpose.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 This miracle worker took away the deaf who knew God.

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 He wanted them to have a chance to hear God's voice,

191
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 to know God.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 So the miracle worker itself is not the purpose.

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It's a method, a means to make people who are disabled,

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 who have broken bones,

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 can hear God's voice,

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 can know God.

197
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 So Isaiah mentioned

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 the blind, deaf, blind, deaf,

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 and mute can be healed.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 So the Bible just mentioned

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 the blind can see, the mute can speak.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 So it is very concentrated to put these points

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 to the people at that time.

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 When they think of the Old and New Testament,

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 they see Jesus doing this miracle,

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 healing a blind man, a deaf man.

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Even he saw in Isaiah,

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 the old man was set free,

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 the blind was set free,

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 a man tied up by a curse was set free.

211
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So Jesus Christ was set free for him.

212
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So when these three things come to mind,

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 they immediately think of the things

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 mentioned in the Old Testament,

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 the things that will happen in the language of Isaiah.

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 So their inferences are consistent.

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So in addition to knowing this Savior,

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 they use the word "David" to describe.

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Because the Bible also mentions

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 the Savior is David's descendant.

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 In Samuel 2,

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Samuel tells David,

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 "When your harvest is satisfied,

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 you will be born again."

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 That is, after David dies,

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 there will be a descendant behind you

227
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 to contact you.

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 "This man will build a temple for me,

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 and I will firmly establish his kingdom

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 until forever."

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It is obvious that David's descendant

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 who built the temple for him

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 is not Solomon.

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Although King Solomon

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 took David as king

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 to build the temple for him,

237
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Solomon's kingdom is not eternal.

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 So the kingdom is eternal.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So it is not Solomon,

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 but the future Savior,

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 David's descendant.

242
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 In Exodus 11,

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 it is mentioned that

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 this descendant is Isaiah's descendant.

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Isaiah is David's father.

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 It is especially emphasized that

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 this Savior has the spirit of Jehovah

248
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 bound on him.

249
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 This spirit is intelligent,

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 resourceful, and capable.

251
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 It is the spirit of Jehovah.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 In Jeremiah,

253
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 it is especially mentioned

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 that this Savior

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 will build a temple for David.

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 He must have the power of king.

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 He is intelligent,

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 and does justice on earth.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 This is the truth.

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It is especially mentioned that

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 this Savior's name

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 will be called Jehovah,

263
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 our second.

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 If we look at the Old Testament,

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 we may not be able to explain

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 what "our second" means.

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But if we explain it from the New Testament,

268
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 we will understand much more.

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Why do we need to look at Paul's explanation?

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Because before Paul saw the resurrection of Christ,

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 he was a Christian who persecuted the Christians.

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 So he understood the thoughts of the Pharisees.

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 He understood the thoughts of the Pharisees

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 when they were saving the world.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 But when God came to him,

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 he explained the Bible of salvation for us.

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 What does this "second" mean?

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 If we look at the Roman book of Paul,

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 when he compared Adam and Christ,

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 he explained this in great detail.

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 He said,

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 "Just as sin comes from a man into the world,

283
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 death comes from sin."

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 This sin will lead to death.

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 This man is Adam.

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Then he said,

287
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Adam is the image of the man who will come in the future.

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 The man who will come in the future is Christ.

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 The Bible says that he is the second Adam.

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 The first Adam committed a crime once,

291
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 and everyone was convicted.

292
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Just as Christ, the second Adam,

293
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 committed a crime once,

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 and everyone was cleared and was saved.

295
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 The first Adam committed a crime once,

296
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 and the whole world was convicted.

297
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 The devil is the authority in the air.

298
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 The world is controlled by the devil.

299
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 But when Christ came,

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 he called those who were willing to accept Christ

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 to be cleared and be saved.

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So he mentioned in verse 21,

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 "Just as sin comes from a man into the world,

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 death comes from sin."

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Just as the second Adam is in charge of the second Adam,

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 who is this second Adam?

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It is Jesus Christ.

308
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 So this second Adam is mentioned in the Old Testament.

309
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 The second Adam is the son of David,

310
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 the son of David,

311
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 the son of David,

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Jesus Christ.

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 So we see that the people at that time

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 saw Jesus speaking in a blind,

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 open-eyed, and mute way,

316
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 and thought that this is the son of David.

317
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 It is very normal, there is a basis.

318
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 But the second Adam,

319
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 the Pharisees said that

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Jesus Christ relied on the ability of the disciples.

321
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Who are the disciples?

322
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 The disciples are the Jews who laughed at the devil's name.

323
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 The meaning of disciples is the people of the eagles.

324
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 They thought that a large group of eagles

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 would stick to the disciples.

326
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 The disciples are the people of the eagles.

327
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It is a very defiant and insulting name.

328
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But I read the whole Old Testament,

329
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 I tried to find it,

330
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 there is no passage in the Bible that mentions

331
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 that it can be driven by the power of the devil.

332
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 The whole teaching of the Old Testament

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 mentions that it can be driven by the power of God.

334
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And the teachers of Judaism

335
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 also use the power of God to drive the devil.

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 So there is no record that

337
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 it can be driven by the power of the devil.

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 So when I was translating this scripture,

339
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I only know this part,

340
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 that is, the almost baseless accusation

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 is to slander Jesus.

342
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So the Pharisees,

343
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 although they knew that they could see Jesus

344
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 was able to drive the devil and heal the sick,

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 they slandered Jesus

346
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 and said that he was driven by the devil to heal the sick.

347
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 After hearing this, Jesus used two answers

348
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 to prove that what they said was not reasonable.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 The first answer was that

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 if each person disputes with each other,

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 he cannot be satisfied.

352
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 The second answer was that

353
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 if Jesus Christ relied on the devil to drive the devil,

354
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 then who did the teachers of Judaism rely on to drive the devil?

355
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Because in Judaism,

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 they also use the power of God to drive the devil.

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So these people will judge the Pharisees

358
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 to slander Jesus.

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 These two answers are actually very clear.

360
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 But I want everyone to pay attention to the first sentence.

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Jesus knows their thoughts.

362
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 This sentence is actually very important to us.

363
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So I don't want to explain it in the following sentence.

364
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Because I want to explain this sentence first.

365
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Jesus knows their thoughts.

366
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It is mentioned many times in the Bible.

367
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 For example, Jesus mentioned in John 2

368
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 that Jesus did a lot of miracles at that time.

369
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Many people believed in his miracles.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 But the Bible says that Jesus did not give himself to them

371
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 because Jesus knew their hearts.

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 If Jesus knew their thoughts,

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 today Jesus Christ also knows your and my thoughts.

374
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 What is special about this?

375
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 This sentence reminds us

376
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 not to stupidly think that God does not know what we think.

377
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Many times we know that God is everywhere.

378
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 God's light shines into our inner heart.

379
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 God's words tell us

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 what is right, what is wrong, what is good, what is evil.

381
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But if we spend a lot of time

382
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 hiding in a dark corner,

383
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 in the final abyss, thinking that God does not know,

384
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 we are like a fool.

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 This is a great crisis and a great stupidity.

386
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 So this sentence reminds us

387
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 that Jesus Christ sees our inner heart.

388
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 God knows our inner heart at any time.

389
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 So we should not deceive ourselves

390
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 to pretend to be blind, to pretend to be deaf, to pretend to be mute,

391
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 to hide in a dark world.

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 If we do not want God to be with us,

393
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 no matter what we see,

394
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 no matter what we think,

395
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 it is not good.

396
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 We must leave it immediately.

397
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 We must try to worship our God every moment,

398
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 to do His good deeds.

399
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 If we do not want God to be with us,

400
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 we must avoid it immediately.

401
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 So I hope you will pay attention to this sentence.

402
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Jesus used these two answers

403
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 to tell you that the accusation that Jesus

404
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 was cured by the king of devils is not reasonable.

405
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Jesus then said two very important words.

406
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 If I rely on God's inspiration,

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 then God's kingdom will come to you.

408
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 How can a man rob his things in the house of a priest?

409
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Unless he first binds the priest,

410
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 otherwise he cannot rob his house.

411
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 As I said, Paul explained the Old Testament.

412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 He said, "Our righteousness" is Jesus Christ.

413
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 This is the second Adam.

414
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 The first Adam committed a crime.

415
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 He entered the world and people had to face death.

416
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 The second Adam is Jesus Christ.

417
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Jesus Christ did not commit a crime.

418
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 As a living sacrifice, as a sacrifice without sin,

419
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 as a priest, he was atoned for us.

420
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 It became two different eras.

421
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 It is mentioned here that Jesus Christ relied on God's inspiration.

422
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 This sentence is very important.

423
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Because when Jesus Christ came to the temple,

424
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 he was restricted by many bodies.

425
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 He was tested like you and me.

426
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 But he relied on God's inspiration to face the test.

427
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 So when he came out to serve,

428
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 he was led by the Holy Spirit to the wilderness

429
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 to face the test of the devil, the test of the truth.

430
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Jesus Christ also relied on God's inspiration to cure the disease and drive away the devil.

431
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 He relied on God's inspiration to do the work of the Father.

432
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So Jesus Christ showed us how we should rely on God's inspiration to live our lives,

433
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 face our difficulties, face our tests,

434
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and how to serve God, to do God's work.

435
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 We should rely on the Holy Spirit.

436
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 This sentence is very important.

437
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 When the Holy Spirit came, the divine vision came.

438
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 It means that in the first Adam's chapter,

439
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 people were bound by the bondage of sin.

440
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Now Jesus Christ's coming is like entering the house of the priest.

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 This priest is the house of the devil.

442
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 In the house of the devil, everyone is bound by sin.

443
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 When Jesus Christ came, he pointed out that he wanted to release this person.

444
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 He wanted to rescue us from the house of the devil.

445
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 This is the meaning of the second chapter, chapter 29.

446
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 The divine vision has come.

447
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Because Jesus Christ has come, he has the ability to release us from sin.

448
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Because the divine vision can release us from sin.

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 At first we are free.

450
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 This is the meaning.

451
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 In the last lecture,

452
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 St. Matthew quoted the second chapter, chapter 40,

453
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 where it is mentioned that the Father gave the Holy Spirit to the Savior.

454
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 The Father gave the Holy Spirit to Jesus Christ,

455
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 the man of the holy line,

456
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 and passed the work to the outside world.

457
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 This is the meaning.

458
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Then Jesus Christ also said,

459
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 "Those who do not follow me are against me;

460
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 those who do not repent with me are in division."

461
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 It means that people cannot be neutral.

462
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 They cannot be neutral in front of God.

463
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Not only cannot be neutral, but also have to participate actively.

464
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Because he said, "Those who do not follow me are against me."

465
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 It means that either you are with me or not.

466
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 There is no middle ground.

467
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 We should not have the illusion that

468
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 "I listen first, let's go to church and listen first."

469
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 It's okay.

470
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 If you do not repent with me,

471
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and do not decide to admit that Jesus Christ is your Savior,

472
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 you are still a devil.

473
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Do not lie to yourself that you are not a devil.

474
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 The Bible says it clearly.

475
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 If you are not with God, you are with the devil.

476
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 There is no middle ground.

477
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Do not think that you have a neutral position.

478
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 There is no such thing.

479
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 The second area is that Jesus Christ said personally,

480
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 "Do not repent with me."

481
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 It means that you do not participate in the service with me.

482
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 It is a division of sin.

483
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So we cannot be neutral.

484
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Either with God or not.

485
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 When we are with God, we have to be active,

486
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 all in, to serve God, to worship God.

487
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 This is the teaching of Jesus Christ.

488
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 As the Columbus Preface says,

489
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 "In the Adam, all people died."

490
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 That is, we are two paths.

491
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 In Christ, all people have to be resurrected.

492
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 In the Adam, those who have a life are healed.

493
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 But the Adam behind,

494
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 that is, Jesus Christ,

495
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 is the Spirit that is like life.

496
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Jesus Christ is life.

497
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 The truth of life.

498
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 He is the source of life.

499
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 God like life.

500
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 So who do we follow?

501
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Do we still stay in this life of death?

502
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Or do we follow Jesus Christ who can bring us back to life?

503
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Paul tells us that this is not a difficult choice.

504
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Jesus Christ, because these Pharisees

505
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 knew that he could heal a hand of dry skin,

506
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 and that Jesus Christ could heal the devil,

507
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 not only did he not come to the Lord,

508
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 but he also insulted Jesus by using the devil to heal the devil.

509
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 So Jesus Christ said a very serious thing.

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 He said, "All sins and sins of the world can be forgiven,

511
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 but the life of sin is not forgiven.

512
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 All that is said about the dry skin of man can be forgiven,

513
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 but that which is said about the dry skin of the Holy Spirit

514
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 is not forgiven in this life and the next."

515
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I believe many Christians are worried

516
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 whether the things I have done will be in vain

517
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 and I will not be forgiven in the future.

518
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 First, I will explain this passage.

519
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 This passage is the same as the 10th chapter of Matthew,

520
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 which mentions two times that Jesus Christ performed a miracle.

521
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 The first miracle was the hand of a dry-skinned man.

522
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 They knew that Jesus could do it.

523
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 They were waiting for him to do it on the day of rest,

524
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 so they could sue him for violating the day of rest.

525
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 They deliberately went to sue Jesus,

526
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 and even wanted to murder Jesus.

527
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 This time Jesus cured the sick and drove away the devil.

528
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 They knew Jesus had the ability.

529
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 They did not deny Jesus had the ability,

530
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 but they did not admit that Jesus came from God.

531
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 On the contrary, they even insulted Jesus

532
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 and said that Jesus was driven away by the devil.

533
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 We need to think about what is so important about the Holy Spirit.

534
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Why is it that the dry-skinned man,

535
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 that is, the dry-skinned man Jesus Christ,

536
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 cannot be the Holy Spirit?

537
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Let's look at the first chapter of the Bible.

538
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 When Peter wrote this book,

539
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 he wrote it to the Christians.

540
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 He said, "Jesus Christ's disciples Peter wrote to Lazarus,

541
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 who was chosen."

542
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 It means that all Christians are chosen by God.

543
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 It is not we who choose God, but God chooses us.

544
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 So everyone understands that it is not us.

545
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 We are originally dead in the midst of transgressions.

546
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 When we are dead in the midst of transgressions,

547
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 we have no response to God's words.

548
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 It is God who awakens our souls,

549
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 so that we can respond to God's words.

550
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So today, many people do not believe in God.

551
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 It is normal for them to not respond to the Holy Spirit.

552
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Because their spirituality is dead.

553
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Just like our spirituality was dead on that day.

554
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 If it were not for God's grace,

555
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 through the Holy Spirit,

556
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 our souls were awakened and responded to God's words,

557
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 we would not have responded to God's words.

558
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 It is mentioned here that

559
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 which Christians are chosen by God?

560
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 According to the precepts of the Father,

561
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 "By the Holy Spirit, we are made holy."

562
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 "Made holy" means to be divided into holy.

563
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 "Divided into holy" means to be divided into holy.

564
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 "By the Holy Spirit, we are made holy."

565
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 "Divided into holy" means to be divided into holy.

566
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."

567
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 It means that a person who is made holy by the Holy Spirit,

568
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 will be made holy by Christ in his heart,

569
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 and Christ will be the Lord of your life.

570
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 "And we are made holy by Christ."

571
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 What does it mean?

572
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 In the Old Testament,

573
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 the priest would pour the blood of sheep and cows

574
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 on the people who were made holy.

575
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 It means that the blood of these people covers your sin.

576
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Jesus Christ died on the cross,

577
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 the blood of cows covered our sin.

578
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 What does it mean?

579
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 What kind of person are these Christians chosen by God?

580
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 They are foreknown to God.

581
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 They are made holy by the Holy Spirit.

582
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 The Holy Spirit is the agent.

583
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 It is the one who makes us holy.

584
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 It means that it is the one who makes us holy.

585
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."

586
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 It means that we are made holy by Christ.

587
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."

588
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 It means that we accept the blood of Christ to cover our sin.

589
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 It means that we admit our sin.

590
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 "And we are made holy by Christ, who shed His blood."

591
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 The blood of Christ is like a cloth of justice.

592
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 A cloth of justice and dignity covers our sin.

593
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 It is not that we are good,

594
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 but the righteousness of Christ covers us.

595
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 It means that we are made holy.

596
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 So the most important part of the work of the Holy Spirit

597
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 is to make our souls holy.

598
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 In John's Gospel,

599
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 when he explained in detail,

600
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 the Holy Spirit comes to make the world to be guilty,

601
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 to be doubtful, to be judged,

602
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 to be self-conceited.

603
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 When the Holy Spirit of truth comes,

604
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 it will lead us to enter or understand all the truth.

605
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 I mentioned before that

606
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 when people are in sin,

607
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 our values are completely crazy.

608
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 We put the wealth of righteousness

609
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 above the creation of God.

610
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 We even do not admit the creation of our Lord.

611
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 We completely reverse many values.

612
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 The work of the Holy Spirit

613
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 is to reorganize our crazy values.

614
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 It is to make us to be guilty, to be doubtful, to be judged.

615
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 It is to make us to know that we are guilty,

616
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 and to know how to punish ourselves.

617
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 When the Holy Spirit lets us know our sin,

618
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 and renew our souls,

619
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 it will slowly lead us to the Word of God

620
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 to teach us to understand the truth.

621
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 So if a person has not been reborn by the Holy Spirit,

622
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 it is meaningless to transmit the Gospel to him.

623
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 No, it is not meaningless.

624
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 He has no response.

625
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And his no response is normal.

626
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Because his spiritual God has died.

627
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Unless the Holy Spirit leads people to transmit the Gospel,

628
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 and the Holy Spirit has entered his heart,

629
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 and reorganized his values,

630
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 and led people to know the truth,

631
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 then people can know God.

632
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 So the Gospel today is to exorcise the Holy Spirit,

633
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 to exorcise the Holy Spirit.

634
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 It is not to say that when we Christians commit a sin,

635
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 we will be in a state of guilt

636
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 and we will not be able to repent.

637
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Because when you are still worried that you have committed a sin,

638
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 and you will offend the Holy Spirit,

639
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 it means that you still have a heart of reverence for God.

640
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 I want to emphasize one point.

641
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 When a Christian truly repents,

642
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 in theory, the Holy Spirit is in his heart.

643
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Some Christians will think,

644
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 if the Holy Spirit is in my heart,

645
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 and I have committed a great sin,

646
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 such as adultery,

647
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 will the Holy Spirit commit a sin with me,

648
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 and I will be a sinner to the Holy Spirit?

649
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Will the Holy Spirit be a sinner to me?

650
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 If you think like this, it is wrong.

651
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 If a Christian really commits a sin,

652
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 it is you who commits a sin,

653
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 not the Holy Spirit.

654
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 The Holy Spirit is watching you commit a sin.

655
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 The Holy Spirit is watching the Christian commit a sin with a sad look.

656
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 The Holy Spirit will not commit a sin.

657
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 So don't get it wrong.

658
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 If we commit a sin, it is we who commit a sin,

659
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 not the Holy Spirit.

660
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 So you have to understand the first point.

661
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 So if you are still worried about making mistakes,

662
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 and you want to honor God,

663
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 you don't have to worry about committing a sin.

664
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 This is the background of the verse.

665
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 The Pharisees knew that only God's power could cure the disease and drive away the devil.

666
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 But they refused to admit it,

667
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 and even insulted Jesus Christ.

668
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 So the sin of the Holy Spirit and the sin of the dry food of the Holy Spirit

669
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 has several conditions.

670
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 First, they knew that God was there.

671
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 They didn't do it unknowingly.

672
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Many people didn't believe it,

673
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 and they said, "If you call Jesus, I will believe it."

674
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 This is because they did it unknowingly.

675
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Think about it.

676
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 A Christian who believes in Jesus Christ

677
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 would not dare to call Jesus Christ.

678
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 So for those who don't know God,

679
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 they won't commit this sin.

680
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 The content of this verse says that those who know God,

681
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 deliberately refuse God,

682
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 even deliberately humiliate God,

683
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 refuse the guidance of the Holy Spirit to die in fear.

684
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 These people are people who have been poisoned by the Holy Spirit,

685
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 and have been dry food of the Holy Spirit.

686
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 So if you are worried that after you believe in God,

687
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 you will commit a great sin,

688
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 and you will be punished for this sin,

689
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 it should have nothing to do with the content of this verse.

690
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 This verse says that those who know God,

691
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 deliberately refuse God,

692
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 even humiliate God,

693
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 that is, humiliate the Holy Spirit.

694
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 It is about these people.

695
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 When a person deliberately refuses the guidance of the Holy Spirit,

696
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 he will never understand the truth.

697
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Only the truth can liberate him.

698
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Let's look at the second passage of the Bible,

699
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 the Bible of the tree and the fruit.

700
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Jesus Christ said,

701
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 "You know that the tree is good, and the fruit is good;

702
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 the tree is bad, and the fruit is bad."

703
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 He is actually describing a person's inner self

704
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 as a water tank.

705
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 What we are holding may be good, may be evil.

706
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 More or less,

707
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 these good and evil will be expressed through our mouths.

708
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 So we have to look at our inner self.

709
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 What is our inner self?

710
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 What is the human nature?

711
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 It is directly expressed through our mouth.

712
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Some people say,

713
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 "No, if I am very jealous of a person,

714
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 but I deliberately praise the person with good words,

715
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 is that okay?"

716
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 That's wrong.

717
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Why?

718
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Because the praise you say with your mouth is hypocrisy.

719
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 When you express it,

720
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 although it is a praise of a person,

721
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 in the eyes of God,

722
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 you are saying falsehood.

723
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 It's all evil.

724
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 So the good words you express with your mouth are all evil.

725
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Because these are false, hypocritical words.

726
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 In fact, this passage has a very important keyword,

727
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 a word,

728
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 which is the "spot of the poisonous snake."

729
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Jesus Christ even said they were evil people.

730
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Why?

731
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 The devil went to test God.

732
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Now these hypocrites are going to test Jesus Christ.

733
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 The word "spot of the poisonous snake"

734
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 appeared in Matthew 3.

735
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 The disciple Matthew

736
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 recorded it in this passage.

737
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 Jesus Christ said it.

738
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 In Matthew 3,

739
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 many people went to the river of Jordan

740
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 to confess their sins to John,

741
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 and wanted to be baptized by John the Baptist.

742
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 John the Baptist saw many Pharisees

743
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 and Sadducees coming to be baptized.

744
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 He actually scolded them,

745
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 "Spot of the poisonous snake,

746
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 who told you to flee?

747
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 You will be angry in the future.

748
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 You will be punished and repent.

749
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Do not speak your mind.

750
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 We have Abraham as our ancestor."

751
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 What is the Bible talking about?

752
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 It's a very special thing.

753
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 At that time, the Pharisees and Sadducees

754
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 went there to confess their sins and wanted to be baptized.

755
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 But Jesus Christ did not baptize them,

756
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 even scolded them.

757
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 "Spot of the poisonous snake" is a very serious term.

758
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 "Spot of the poisonous snake"

759
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 means "spot of the devil's descendant".

760
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Why?

761
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Because Jesus Christ told them

762
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 they did not repent.

763
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 You have to get out of the fire.

764
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 "The heart of repentance is within the fire."

765
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 That is, they did not confess their sins,

766
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 which does not mean repentance.

767
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Many people do today.

768
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Even in the church,

769
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 we say we confess our sins and we are baptized,

770
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 but we do not repent.

771
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 What is confession?

772
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Confession is to tell people that I am guilty.

773
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 Even the Jews who betrayed Jesus

774
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 know that they are guilty.

775
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 The Bible says clearly that they are guilty,

776
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 but they did not repent,

777
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 so they hanged themselves.

778
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 True repentance has two meanings.

779
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 The change of thoughts and thoughts

780
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 is the change from sin to righteousness.

781
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 It is not enough.

782
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 It needs to add the change of life,

783
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 the change of behavior.

784
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 That is, the change of thoughts and behaviors

785
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 from sin to righteousness is called repentance.

786
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Knowing sin does not mean repentance.

787
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 The change of thoughts and behaviors

788
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 from sin to righteousness is called repentance.

789
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 If a person knows sin but does not repent,

790
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 it is like the Jews who are now cursing the Pharisees.

791
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 They have no life fruit.

792
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Because they have never repented in their hearts.

793
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 So today's words also refer to Jesus Christ

794
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 using the same words,

795
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 "You are evil people."

796
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Because the devil went to test God,

797
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 tested Jesus Christ.

798
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 These people are also testing Jesus Christ.

799
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 The same.

800
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Finally, let's look at the passage of the Gospel of the Last Supper.

801
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 This passage is very important.

802
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 I hope everyone will listen carefully

803
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 to my explanation below.

804
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 This passage is very special.

805
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 There were several words in it.

806
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 The Pharisees said to Jesus,

807
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 "Teacher, we want to ask you to show us the gospel."

808
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 I emphasize that the content of the gospel I want to talk about today

809
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 is the gospel that can be seen with the eyes,

810
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 not the gospel that changes a person's heart and mind

811
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 and awakens the soul.

812
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 These are all gospels,

813
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 but this is the gospel that cannot be seen by the appearance.

814
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 The gospel I am talking about today is the gospel that can be seen with the eyes.

815
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 For example, the gospel that can be seen with the eyes

816
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 of those who cure diseases, drive away the devil, and turn the water into wine.

817
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Jesus Christ then responded to their request

818
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 from chapter 39 to 42.

819
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 He asked them to show us the gospel.

820
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 Let us see.

821
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Can you show us the gospel?

822
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 It is to be seen.

823
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 When I explain chapter 39 to 42,

824
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 I have to explain three aspects first,

825
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 so that I can explain this passage.

826
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 This passage is not difficult to understand.

827
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 It mentions that the first night of the day is three days and three nights

828
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 in the fish's stomach, which is equivalent to the three days and three nights

829
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 between the resurrection of Jesus Christ and death.

830
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 It mentions the repentance of the Nile,

831
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 and the queen of the south to hear Solomon's words.

832
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 These are all things that we cannot understand.

833
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 But there is a deep meaning behind it.

834
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 I want to explain it to you today.

835
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 Before I explain, I have to explain three things.

836
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 The first is the word "sacrifice".

837
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 The word "sacrifice" is not the word "miracle"

838
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 in the original text and the Bible.

839
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 It is not the word "sacrifice".

840
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 It is actually a sign.

841
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 If you look at the English Bible, it says "they asked for a sign".

842
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 What is the sign?

843
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 It is like a road sign.

844
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 This road sign points to Satan.

845
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 The sign is not the goal.

846
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 The sign is only pointing to the goal.

847
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 So if we see a sign in the kingdom of God,

848
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 a road sign pointing to Satan,

849
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 this road sign is not Satan.

850
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 You are still in the kingdom of God.

851
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Do you understand?

852
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 So let's not get the word wrong.

853
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Because the Chinese Bible also means "sacrifice".

854
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 But the real English or original text

855
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 is an indication or a sign.

856
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 So you understand this first.

857
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 The second is "trust" and "repentance".

858
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 "Trust" and "repentance" are the same.

859
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 It is one side of the coin.

860
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 It cannot be separated.

861
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 The word "trust" in the Bible is very clear.

862
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 There is a range.

863
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 The range of "trust" in the Bible

864
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 is the words of God and God.

865
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 God is the true nature.

866
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 The words spoken by the true nature are the truth.

867
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 So we trust the words of God and God.

868
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 Today I believe in Jesus Christ and the teachings of Jesus Christ.

869
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 This is the range.

870
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 So "trust" is not about a student

871
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 who is hardworking in studying and has confidence in his exam.

872
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 The confidence of a person is not.

873
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 The confidence in the Bible is the words of God and God.

874
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 The characteristic of "trust" is

875
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 we accept what we understand rationally.

876
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 We trust God in the non-rational and super-rational range.

877
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 For example, God teaches us to love and be kind.

878
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 We can understand this rationally.

879
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 If God says that Jesus Christ changed the water,

880
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 this cannot be explained rationally.

881
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 People's rationality cannot be understood.

882
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 It is beyond the super-rational range.

883
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 We accept it with confidence.

884
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 And faith does not die.

885
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 So we have confidence in God.

886
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 This is the same as repentance.

887
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 When we hear God's words,

888
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 we change our thoughts and ideas and turn to the right way.

889
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 When we turn to the right way,

890
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 there are two aspects of repentance.

891
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 The change of thoughts and ideas plus the change of life.

892
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 Turn to the right way.

893
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 The change of life is that we have faith.

894
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 Because faith has action, it is death.

895
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 So faith and repentance are two sides of a coin.

896
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 We cannot separate them.

897
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 So sometimes we talk about faith and sometimes repentance.

898
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 They are the same thing.

899
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 This is the second principle I want to clarify.

900
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 The third principle is that we need to pay attention.

901
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 I will explain it.

902
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 In the Roman book of Paul,

903
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 he explains how people can trust God.

904
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 I call this the five principles of trust.

905
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 What does he say?

906
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 "But if no man believes him, how can he pray to him?

907
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 If no man hears him, how can he believe him?

908
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 If no man hears him, how can he preach him?

909
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 If no man hears him, how can he preach him?"

910
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 It seems difficult to understand the four principles.

911
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 But if we read it from the end, it is very simple.

912
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 First, if there is no man to preach, how can he preach?

913
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 That is, the man to preach first,

914
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 the man to preach first, then someone to preach.

915
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 If someone preaches, someone hears.

916
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 If someone hears, someone believes.

917
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 If someone believes, someone prays to God.

918
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 So if we look at it in reverse,

919
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 we see the five principles of trust in God.

920
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 God's people preach God's way.

921
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 God's people listen to God's words to preach God's words.

922
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 If someone hears,

923
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 if it is a good word,

924
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 a word of respect for God,

925
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 they will believe.

926
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 They will believe and pray to God,

927
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 and return to God's side.

928
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 God's people preach God's way.

929
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 People can hear in the third stage,

930
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 and then have the opportunity to believe in God and pray to God.

931
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 This is the five principles of trust in God.

932
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 In the Bible, in Romans 7, it is mentioned that

933
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 "It is clear that the faith is from the one who hears,

934
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 and the one who hears is directly from Christ."

935
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 This is a very important principle of the Bible.

936
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 A person believes in God.

937
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Faith comes from listening to God.

938
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 You have to rely on God,

939
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 understand God's words,

940
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 in order to have faith.

941
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 There can be no other way.

942
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 If we look at these five principles,

943
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 we should pay attention to the relationship between the topic I am talking about today.

944
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 The topic today is "The relationship between the work of God and the truth."

945
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 I want to talk about the relationship between the work of God and the truth.

946
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 What is special about the five principles?

947
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 If you can see,

948
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 there is no work of God that can be seen.

949
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 The work of God is not in this process.

950
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 The work of God that can be seen is not in this process.

951
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 There is no work of God.

952
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 Some work of God is invisible.

953
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 For example, a person hears,

954
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 a person hears,

955
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 and it is the Holy Spirit.

956
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 When the heart of a person is poured into,

957
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 it is the Holy Spirit that awakens the soul of the person.

958
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 This is invisible.

959
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 It is also a work of God.

960
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 But what I am talking about today is not the work of God that changes in the heart.

961
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 What I want to say is the work of God that can be seen with the eyes.

962
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 Because these Fascists call Jesus Christ,

963
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 "Show us the work of God,

964
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 let us see the work of God that He wants to see with the eyes."

965
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Today you can see the five books of the Holy Spirit,

966
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 the five books of the Holy Spirit,

967
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 the work of God that does not need to be seen with the eyes.

968
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 But this principle of the Bible,

969
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 Paul wrote it very clearly.

970
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 But it was not Paul who came up with it.

971
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 When we look at Jesus Christ,

972
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 we understand that the revelation of God in the Bible is very exquisite.

973
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 When Jesus mentioned the story of Jonah,

974
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 we look at the story of Jonah,

975
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 we see the five books,

976
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 which were already in the Old Testament.

977
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 We look at the third chapter of Jonah,

978
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 we see that the second time Jonah was brought to Jerusalem,

979
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 he went to the city of Nile,

980
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 and told the people there,

981
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 "You see, God has shown Jonah."

982
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Jonah followed the words of Jonah,

983
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 and went to the city of Nile.

984
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Then he entered the city and announced,

985
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 "In forty days, the city of Nile will be reconquered."

986
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 God showed Jonah,

987
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 and Jonah listened to the message and preached it.

988
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 The people heard it.

989
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 What did they do?

990
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 They came and believed in the Lord.

991
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 They believed in the Lord and announced the ban on eating.

992
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 From small to large, they had to wear a coat.

993
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 It meant that they were in a dire situation.

994
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 Not only that, they even had to bow down.

995
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 Because they were worried that they would not be able to receive the baptism of Christ.

996
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 They were worried that they would not be able to do it.

997
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 They had to bow down and go to the cross.

998
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 They pleaded with God,

999
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 and then they had to turn away from their evil ways.

1000
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 That was repentance.

1001
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 So believing in the Lord and repentance are the same.

1002
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 They cannot be separated.

1003
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 So you can see that Jesus Christ told the story of Jonah.

1004
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 Not only in his three days in the fishing boat,

1005
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 but also in the whole process,

1006
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 the five steps of believing in God

1007
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 did not require any visible signs.

1008
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 It did not require any signs.

1009
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 If these foreigners can't see the signs,

1010
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 but they still believe in them,

1011
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 then these Jews who saw so many signs of Jesus Christ,

1012
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 and they still need to see a few more signs,

1013
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 but they still don't believe in them,

1014
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 is it worth judging?

1015
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 Can these foreigners accuse you?

1016
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 We, foreigners, can't see the visible signs,

1017
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 but we still believe.

1018
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 Jonah said,

1019
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 "You have to repent in 40 days."

1020
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 He did not allow you to repent,

1021
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 nor did he tell you to repent quickly.

1022
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 He did not say that.

1023
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 Those people also believed and repented,

1024
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 and left their evil ways to believe in God.

1025
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 So you can see that God showed people the way to spread the gospel,

1026
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 people heard the way,

1027
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 and believed in the way,

1028
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 and they pleaded with God.

1029
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 The five scriptures of faith,

1030
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 in the whole process,

1031
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 did not require any visible signs.

1032
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 This is one of the very important key points

1033
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 that Jesus Christ used in this story.

1034
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 We can look at many examples

1035
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 to prove that these five scriptures are correct.

1036
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 For example,

1037
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 John 4, Jesus Christ went to Samaria

1038
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 to talk to a woman by the lake.

1039
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 She told him how many husbands this woman had.

1040
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 Then they had a conversation.

1041
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 Jesus Christ disdained the truth,

1042
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 he said God is the spirit,

1043
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 so worship Him with your heart and be sincere in worshiping Him.

1044
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 This woman said to him,

1045
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 "I know that Nehemiah is called the origin of Christ.

1046
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
 He will tell us all things.

1047
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 Jesus Christ said to her,

1048
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 "I am the one who is speaking to you."

1049
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 This is the first time Jesus Christ clearly told people

1050
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 that He is the Savior.

1051
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 He told a woman from a foreign country.

1052
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 A woman from a foreign country,

1053
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 who was probably not visible to others.

1054
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 After this woman talked to Jesus,

1055
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 she immediately went to other people in the city.

1056
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 Many people came out to hear Jesus talk.

1057
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 Jesus stayed for a few days.

1058
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 Then Jesus said,

1059
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 "If you believe in Jesus,

1060
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 there will be more people who will believe in Him."

1061
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 So you can see that Jesus Christ has been in Samaria for a few days.

1062
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 People believe in Him because of His way.

1063
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 There is no cure for the disease.

1064
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 Why?

1065
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 Because the Bible is very clear.

1066
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 "If you believe in Jesus, there will be more people who will believe in Him."

1067
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 "If you believe in Jesus, there will be more people who will believe in Him."

1068
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 This is what Jesus Christ said.

1069
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 So in the whole process of faith,

1070
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 in the people of Samaria,

1071
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 Jesus Christ did not see the miracle.

1072
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 Let's look at why Jesus Christ did not need a miracle.

1073
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
 I can see at least two reasons.

1074
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 The first reason is Hebrews.

1075
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 Hebrews reminds us that we must pay attention to the way we hear

1076
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 so that we do not stray.

1077
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 What is this way?

1078
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 It is about salvation.

1079
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
 It is about salvation.

1080
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 It is what Jesus Christ said.

1081
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 And the people who hear it are proved to be true.

1082
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 But at the same time,

1083
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 God uses the miracle of the Holy Spirit

1084
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 and the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit

1085
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 to witness with them.

1086
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 The function of the miracle is to witness.

1087
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 The miracle is not the way of God.

1088
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 You have to hear the way to believe.

1089
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 The miracle is to witness.

1090
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 Like the sign points to the person who performs the miracle

1091
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 comes from God.

1092
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 This is the function of the miracle.

1093
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 The sign points to the direction.

1094
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 This is the function.

1095
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 The second function is mentioned in Exodus 2.

1096
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 When the Savior came, the deaf could hear,

1097
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 and the blind could see.

1098
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 What does it mean to see?

1099
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 It means God.

1100
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 Jesus Christ did the miracle of healing the sick and driving away the evil.

1101
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 He took away the people who could not believe in God

1102
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 because of the disease and the restrictions on flesh.

1103
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 He asked them to hear God's words,

1104
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 to see God, to know God.

1105
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 So there are two functions.

1106
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
 Jesus Christ did the miracle.

1107
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 First, he is the Savior of the language.

1108
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 The purpose of the miracle is to let people know God.

1109
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 So the most important thing is to hear God's way.

1110
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 But God also uses the miracle to witness.

1111
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 Pointing to the direction of God.

1112
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 So in simple terms,

1113
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 the miracle is like a witness

1114
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 to point to God's existence and His great power.

1115
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 Jesus Christ is the Savior of the language.

1116
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 Jesus came from God.

1117
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

1118
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 Jesus Christ is the Holy Spirit.

1119
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 So the whole miracle is pointing to Jesus Christ, the Savior.

1120
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 So these miracles are not the purpose.

1121
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 The purpose is to point to the purpose.

1122
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 Let us know that Jesus Christ is the Savior.

1123
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 He asked us to hear God's way.

1124
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 So the miracle is a means, not a purpose.

1125
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 The purpose is to hear and believe.

1126
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 Because the faith comes from the way of hearing.

1127
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 And the way of hearing is directly from the words of Jesus Christ.

1128
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 Let's look at another positive example.

1129
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 When Nehemiah went to see Jesus,

1130
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
 he said, "We"

1131
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 Pay attention to the word "We".

1132
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 Who is "We"?

1133
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 Nehemiah was a high-ranking Pharisee.

1134
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 He said "We" means

1135
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
 not all Pharisees thought Jesus was a king.

1136
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 Not all Pharisees wanted to

1137
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 accuse Jesus of his pain.

1138
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 There were a group of very intellectual Pharisees

1139
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
 who saw Jesus' miracles and knew that he came from God.

1140
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 Why?

1141
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 He said, "We"

1142
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 Not only him, but also "We"

1143
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 "know that you are a teacher from God.

1144
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
 Because the miracles you do

1145
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
 are not possible without God's presence."

1146
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 So they saw the miracles.

1147
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 Like a sign, it means you must come from God.

1148
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 This is the function of miracles.

1149
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 Miracles are not the purpose.

1150
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 This is the purpose of the miracles.

1151
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 Jesus Christ came from God.

1152
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 When this happened,

1153
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 they heard Jesus' truth.

1154
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 So Jesus answered,

1155
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 "I tell you the truth.

1156
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 If man does not be reborn, he will not see God."

1157
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
 This is a very important truth.

1158
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Then in chapter 16,

1159
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 "God loves the world, and even places his own son

1160
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
 at his door.

1161
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 If he believes in him, he will not perish,

1162
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
 but will be reborn."

1163
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 So you see, miracles are his function.

1164
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
 He pointed to Christ,

1165
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 came from God.

1166
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 Then Jesus showed the truth.

1167
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
 People believed it.

1168
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
 This is one of the positive examples.

1169
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
 There is also a counter-example.

1170
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 In John 2,

1171
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 Jesus performed many miracles.

1172
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 Many people saw the miracles and believed in his name.

1173
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 But Jesus did not deliver himself to them,

1174
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 because he knew what was in the hearts of the people.

1175
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 Jesus knew the hearts of people.

1176
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 He saw the hearts of people.

1177
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
 What is the problem with these people?

1178
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 They saw and believed.

1179
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 If you look at these five verses,

1180
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
 what is the problem?

1181
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 "If you see the miracles, believe in him, and you will know him."

1182
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 They did not hear it.

1183
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 Faith comes from hearing.

1184
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 The "hearing" is what Jesus said.

1185
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 So if some people see the miracles and believe,

1186
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 what do they believe in?

1187
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
 There is no basis.

1188
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
 Our faith is in the "hearing" of God,

1189
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
 not in the miracles.

1190
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 So don't get it wrong.

1191
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
 Don't be too excited about miracles.

1192
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 Don't be too obsessed with miracles.

1193
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
 That is not what we want to see.

1194
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
 Many people believe in God.

1195
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 Whether it is the women of Samaria,

1196
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 or other villagers,

1197
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
 they believe in Jesus' faith.

1198
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 Even the people of Mexico and Guatemala,

1199
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 they believe in God's faith.

1200
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
 So those who believe in God's faith,

1201
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 but do not believe in God's faith,

1202
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 are meaningless.

1203
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 Jesus Christ does not teach them.

1204
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 Because Jesus Christ knows that they do not have God's faith in their hearts.

1205
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 Back to today's scripture,

1206
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 the Pharisees asked Jesus to show them the miracles.

1207
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
 He had already seen so many miracles.

1208
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
 One after another,

1209
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 from healing to healing.

1210
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
 He saw the power of God in the material world,

1211
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
 and also saw the power of God in the spiritual world.

1212
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
 So Jesus Christ's power is getting stronger.

1213
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 They do not believe.

1214
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
 They insult Jesus by calling him the "Devil King".

1215
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
 Even if Jesus Christ was healing the sick and chasing the devil on the Sabbath,

1216
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 they use this excuse to kill Jesus.

1217
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
 Why?

1218
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 We see the answer in chapter 13.

1219
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
 Because there is an answer in John 8.

1220
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
 Jesus Christ said,

1221
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 "I know that you are descendants of Abel,

1222
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
 and you want to kill me,

1223
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 because your hearts are not able to stand my wrath."

1224
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 "You are descendants of Abel"

1225
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 This sentence has just appeared.

1226
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
 I have seen it before.

1227
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,000
 "Descendants of Abel" emphasizes the pride of their spiritual life.

1228
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
 We have seen it today.

1229
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 I remember I talked to a couple about faith.

1230
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
 They said they were Christians.

1231
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 I asked them how to believe in God.

1232
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
 They gave a very strange answer.

1233
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 They said, "We are Christians because

1234
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
 I was baptized by a very famous pastor in a church with more than 1,000 members."

1235
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 "So we are Christians."

1236
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
 "It has nothing to do with religion."

1237
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
 This is the pride of the spiritual life.

1238
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
 The Pharisees also have this pride.

1239
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
 "But you want to kill me because your hearts are not able to stand my wrath."

1240
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 After hearing this, they can't accept Jesus Christ's wrath.

1241
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 Because for the Pharisees,

1242
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 for those who want to target Jesus,

1243
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,000
 Jesus Christ's existence is affecting their authority,

1244
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
 their status,

1245
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 and even their interests.

1246
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
 Why do I say this?

1247
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 When Jesus Christ entered Jerusalem to be baptized,

1248
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 the whole structure of the church was like a company.

1249
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 There were a lot of businesses,

1250
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
 such as buying and selling beef and exchanging money.

1251
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 A large business.

1252
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 Jesus Christ actually went there to cause trouble.

1253
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 He said they were doing business and destroyed the tables.

1254
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 Why did he do business?

1255
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 When Jesus Christ was baptized,

1256
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 thousands of people followed him.

1257
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 Jesus Christ was not baptized in Jerusalem.

1258
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 He was baptized outside,

1259
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 at the lake.

1260
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
 Not at the religious center in Jerusalem.

1261
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 As a teacher of the Bible,

1262
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 people did not follow him, but followed Jesus.

1263
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 So it affected their status and authority.

1264
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 But not all of them.

1265
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 As I said,

1266
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
 the Pharisees and some of the intellectuals

1267
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 actually saw that Jesus Christ was a faithful man.

1268
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
 But these people wanted to kill Jesus.

1269
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 It's outrageous.

1270
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 Even if you say you want to kill Jesus,

1271
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
 you don't have to kill him.

1272
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
 They actually wanted to kill him with the intention of poisoning him.

1273
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 Because they could not tolerate the Holy Spirit.

1274
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
 If we look at the next chapter,

1275
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 chapter 13,

1276
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
 Matthew tells the story of Jesus' execution.

1277
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 After listening to the five verses,

1278
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
 before he was crucified,

1279
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 it was important to know which kind of soil he was on.

1280
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 Which kind of soil represents the heart of man,

1281
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 how he respects God's words.

1282
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
 So in the Bible,

1283
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 it mentions the roadside, the shallow soil, the steep, the good soil.

1284
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 Roadside refers to the words of the apostles,

1285
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 thrown on the roadside, and to be trampled a few more times.

1286
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
 Many people today are like this.

1287
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 Not only to blame the Christians for spreading the gospel,

1288
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
 but also to insult and mock Jesus Christ.

1289
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 Some of them are shallow soils,

1290
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
 which are pleasant to hear,

1291
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
 but soon they will no longer be heard.

1292
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 Some soils are deep.

1293
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 They feel it's good to try to be a Christian,

1294
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
 but they find that the world is better,

1295
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 and the good soil is more attractive.

1296
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
 They no longer go to the roadside.

1297
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 The good soil is the small part.

1298
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
 Jesus Christ said that there are few people who have enough.

1299
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 It is the words of those who have heard God's words,

1300
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
 respect God's words,

1301
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 and change God's words to change their lives.

1302
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
 Those are the good soils.

1303
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 So you see, these legal people are on the roadside.

1304
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
 They are on the road of money and God.

1305
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 And the legal people who came to the bottom,

1306
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
 in the end, are the good soil of the minority.

1307
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
 They believe in God.

1308
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
 So we go back to the previous passage,

1309
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 we see that Jesus knows their hearts.

1310
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
 They want to see some more visible signs.

1311
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 In fact, they will not believe.

1312
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
 Let's think about the Great Christian Egypt of Moses.

1313
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 They saw the Red Sea separated.

1314
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
 They walked through the Red Sea in their own dry sea bed.

1315
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 They went to the opposite side of the Red Sea,

1316
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
 there was nothing to eat.

1317
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
 God gave them spicy food.

1318
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
 They see the signs every day,

1319
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
 but they do not believe in the signs.

1320
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
 So the signs do not help people to believe in God.

1321
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 It is the way of God that can make people believe in God.

1322
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 Faith comes from hearing,

1323
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 from God's words, not from seeing the signs.

1324
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
 So they saw the Red Sea separated.

1325
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
 Every day they saw God throwing food to them in heaven.

1326
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 They do not believe in the signs.

1327
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 So we should not be vain in pursuing the signs.

1328
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
 We should work hard to study God's words,

1329
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
 to know God's words.

1330
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 This is the truth.

1331
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
 So when Jesus answered them,

1332
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
 he said, "The generation of evil and disorder,

1333
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
 seek God's work."

1334
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
 Evil and disorder means not to believe.

1335
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
 Why do I use this sentence?

1336
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
 In the history of the whole of Israel,

1337
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
 Solomon was a turning point.

1338
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
 Solomon did a big evil thing,

1339
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
 that is, he made many people

1340
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
 into the hands of foreign traitors,

1341
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
 and at the same time,

1342
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
 he brought the false idol of the foreign country to Israel.

1343
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
 The king of Israel,

1344
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
 whether it is the Kingdom of Israel in the north

1345
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
 or the Kingdom of Judah in the south,

1346
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
 committed the sin of worshiping idols.

1347
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
 God wanted these two kingdoms to be destroyed.

1348
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
 This is the grace of God.

1349
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 God wanted them to be destroyed,

1350
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
 and they were painfully tortured.

1351
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
 Since then, Israel has not worshipped idols.

1352
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
 Since they did not worship idols,

1353
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 why did they say they did not believe?

1354
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
 It is because they did not believe in the heart of Israel.

1355
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
 Because they did not put God in the center of their hearts.

1356
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
 These people of Israel

1357
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 only have the Chinese people

1358
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
 and the Pharisees.

1359
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
 They only have the appearance of religion

1360
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
 and have no reality of religion.

1361
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
 They are hypocrites.

1362
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
 They do not believe in God.

1363
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 So Jesus saw their hearts and said,

1364
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
 "You people of this generation are seeking a miracle."

1365
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
 He said, "There is only one miracle for you.

1366
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
 Except for the prophet Jonah,

1367
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
 how did Jonah survive three days and three nights

1368
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
 in the fish's stomach?

1369
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
 The same prophet had to stay in the ground for three days and three nights.

1370
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
 This means that Jesus Christ died,

1371
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
 was buried and resurrected.

1372
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
 In the book of Luke,

1373
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
 there is one more sentence.

1374
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
 He said, "How did Jonah make a miracle for you people?"

1375
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
 The miracle should also be indicated.

1376
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
 People should be like this

1377
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
 to be a guidance for the people of this generation.

1378
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
 What does this mean?

1379
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
 Jonah actually foretold Jesus Christ.

1380
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
 When Jonah heard the call of God

1381
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
 to come to Jerusalem,

1382
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
 the place in northeast Israel at that time,

1383
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
 he took a boat to the west.

1384
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
 He wanted to take a boat to

1385
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
 Spain, which was thousands of miles away.

1386
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
 When he was on the boat,

1387
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
 God let the wind and the waves.

1388
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
 Everyone at that time was afraid.

1389
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
 Everyone prayed to their own God.

1390
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
 Jonah told them, "You can throw me into the sea."

1391
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
 He sacrificed himself to calm God's anger.

1392
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
 "Let others be saved."

1393
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 This is what Jonah did at that time.

1394
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
 This is to foretell Jesus Christ

1395
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
 to use his own life

1396
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
 to die on the cross for sinners

1397
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
 to atone for sins and to calm God's anger.

1398
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
 Jonah stayed in the boat for three days and three nights

1399
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
 to foretell Jesus Christ's resurrection.

1400
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
 This is the great power of the witness God.

1401
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
 That's what it means.

1402
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
 Why did Jesus Christ say

1403
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
 "I will make you a miracle"?

1404
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
 Because we see Jesus continue to do miracles.

1405
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
 But this sentence is actually meaningful.

1406
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
 Jesus Christ's miracles

1407
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 have nothing to do with these unbelievers.

1408
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
 For example, he resurrected the dead from the cross.

1409
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
 These are not related to these people.

1410
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
 The only one related to these people

1411
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
 is Jesus Christ's resurrection.

1412
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
 This is the ultimate miracle.

1413
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
 Jesus Christ resurrected on the third day after his death.

1414
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
 If they don't believe this, they can't be saved.

1415
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
 So we look at Jesus' answer.

1416
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
 In the trial, the Nile people

1417
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
 had to stand up and convict the people of this generation.

1418
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
 Because the Nile people heard the voice,

1419
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
 they heard the voice of Jonah.

1420
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
 The word "repentance" and "belief" are the same.

1421
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 So Jesus' response

1422
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
 points to the five books of the Book of Ecclesiastes.

1423
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
 These people had never seen the miracles of the eyes.

1424
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
 They believed when they heard the voice.

1425
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
 The Pharisees and many Jews at that time

1426
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
 saw a lot of miracles, but they didn't believe.

1427
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
 So when these foreigners were judged,

1428
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
 they could come out and accuse you.

1429
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
 We foreigners have never seen miracles, but we believe.

1430
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
 You see so many miracles,

1431
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
 and the Savior is in front of you,

1432
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
 you don't believe.

1433
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
 So you have nothing to say.

1434
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
 So simply speaking,

1435
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
 the miracles and the truth

1436
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
 I am talking about the miracles of the eyes

1437
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
 have nothing to do with faith.

1438
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
 The five books of the true faith

1439
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:43,000
 do not need the miracles of the eyes.

1440
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
 The function of miracles is a direction.

1441
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
 The direction of Jesus Christ is this salvation.

1442
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 So faith comes from hearing,

1443
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
 not from seeing God.

1444
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
 The direction of hearing is the words of Christ.

1445
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
 And we know the words of Christ,

1446
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
 know the truth,

1447
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
 the truth will make us free.

1448
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
 The story of King Sibelius is the same.

1449
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
 King Sibelius went to the south

1450
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
 to see King Solomon.

1451
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
 He asked a lot of questions,

1452
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
 Solomon answered all his questions.

1453
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
 So Solomon did a whole-way job.

1454
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
 After King Solomon heard the questions,

1455
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
 he said, "If you have wisdom, you will be blessed."

1456
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
 Then he said, "Your God is worthy of praise."

1457
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
 He heard someone preaching,

1458
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
 King Solomon listened and believed.

1459
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
 Then King Solomon gave him a lot of gifts

1460
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
 and returned to his country.

1461
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
 We generally believe that

1462
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
 when King Solomon returned to Ethiopia,

1463
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
 he brought the Jews back to Ethiopia.

1464
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
 Because after 1000 years,

1465
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
 we know that

1466
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
 in the book of Exodus,

1467
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
 there is a priest named Ezechias.

1468
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
 At that time, this priest served

1469
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
 under King Ezechias,

1470
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
 the head of the rich family of King Gama.

1471
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
 He went to Jerusalem to worship.

1472
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
 He was a foreigner who believed in the Jews.

1473
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
 It was recorded that

1474
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
 he was reading the book of Ezekias in his car.

1475
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
 He was holding a book of Ezechias.

1476
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
 The book of Ezechias said that

1477
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 the priest Ezechias was being killed,

1478
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
 he was being judged unjustly,

1479
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
 and he was being killed.

1480
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
 Philip explained the gospel

1481
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
 and the gospel related to Jesus Christ.

1482
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
 So we believe that

1483
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 the Queen of Sheba believed in the God of Solomon

1484
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
 and brought the Jewish doctrine

1485
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
 to Ethiopia.

1486
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
 It is worth noting that

1487
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
 this priest was holding a book of Ezechias.

1488
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
 The Bible at that time was handwritten,

1489
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
 very expensive.

1490
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
 He had a lot of capital.

1491
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
 He bought a book to read.

1492
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
 So I hope everyone will buy a good,

1493
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
 well-known Bible

1494
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
 to study the word of God.

1495
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
 Finally, we compare the gospel of Jesus Christ.

1496
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
 He compared it with Jesus Christ with the book of Ezekias.

1497
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
 The book of Ezekias was a prophet.

1498
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
 Jesus was a greater prophet,

1499
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
 a true body.

1500
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
 But the book of Ezekias did not perform a miracle.

1501
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
 It just said that you will be destroyed.

1502
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
 He did not even mention them repenting.

1503
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
 But all the foreigners in the city of Lemnipolis

1504
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
 repented and believed in God.

1505
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
 Instead, Jesus Christ himself appeared

1506
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
 and preached the gospel to the Jews.

1507
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
 He performed many miracles.

1508
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
 But most Jews did not believe.

1509
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,000
 Solomon and Jesus were kings.

1510
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
 But Jesus was the eternal king,

1511
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
 the son of God.

1512
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
 The prophet of the king of Solomon and the king of Zebalia

1513
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
 did not see any miracles.

1514
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
 Zebalia, as a foreigner,

1515
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
 also believed in God.

1516
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
 But many Jews

1517
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
 did not repent and believe in Jesus.

1518
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
 So Jesus said that

1519
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
 this generation of unbelievers will seek God's miracles.

1520
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
 So we should not be obsessed with the miracle of God's miracles.

1521
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
 Because faith comes from hearing.

1522
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
 Instead, we should work hard to study the Bible,

1523
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
 understand the Bible, and spread the Bible.

1524
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
 So that more people can hear and believe

1525
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
 and pray to God.

1526
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
 Today, I will summarize the three points of the Bible.

1527
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
 The first point is that

1528
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
 Jesus Christ knows our thoughts and ideas.

1529
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
 So we should always be vigilant and reverent to God.

1530
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
 Do not be ignorant and think that God does not know what we are doing.

1531
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
 We can't hide.

1532
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
 The light of God is always in us.

1533
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
 The light of God is always in our hearts.

1534
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
 We are just deliberately blind, deliberately deaf, deliberately dumb

1535
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
 to escape God.

1536
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
 If we still want to keep some dark places in our hearts,

1537
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
 God knows.

1538
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
 Do not deceive yourself.

1539
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
 Jesus Christ is the Lord of the material world and the spiritual world.

1540
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
 No matter what disease, ghosts, and evangelization,

1541
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
 He is the Lord of the material world and the spiritual world.

1542
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
 And the Lord of God has come to us.

1543
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
 When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord,

1544
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
 the Lord of God is already in our hearts.

1545
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
 But the question is,

1546
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
 does our heart accept the words of Jesus Christ?

1547
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
 Do we listen to a part and not listen to a part?

1548
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:59,000
 Or is it a respectful and respectful teaching of God?

1549
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
 The second is to remove the fruit from the tree and the fruit from the seed.

1550
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
 That is, our life must change and our heart must be reconciled with our repentance.

1551
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
 Do not be a false Christian.

1552
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
 Because being a false Christian is the most stupid.

1553
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:23,000
 Rather than being a Christian who wants to be a false Christian in the church,

1554
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
 why not not go to church?

1555
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
 Because if you don't go to church, you will end up in hell.

1556
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
 But if you live a false Christian life in the church,

1557
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
 you will end up in hell.

1558
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
 This is the stupidest thing.

1559
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
 So we should not deceive God.

1560
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
 Because God is unbecoming.

1561
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:46,000
 Believe in God and repent and confess your sins.

1562
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
 Really ask God to help us to go through a holy trial and live a life that is in harmony with God.

1563
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
 Do not be a slave to God.

1564
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
 Finally, the work of God is a direction, not a goal.

1565
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
 It is the direction of Jesus Christ's holiness,

1566
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
 so that people can hear God's words and see God's great power.

1567
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
 So we should not be obsessed with the work of God.

1568
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,000
 Also, do not think that the work of God is the foundation of faith.

1569
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
 The work of God is not the foundation of faith.

1570
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
 It is not the foundation of faith.

1571
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
 Faith comes from the way of hearing,

1572
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
 and the way of hearing comes from the words of Jesus Christ.

1573
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
 So when Jesus Christ talked about his sign of the holy meal,

1574
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
 he said, "In the future, you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood."

1575
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
 Many people think that this is a difficult path.

1576
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
 Maybe today I have talked for a long time,

1577
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
 some people think that Professor Hsu's talk is very long and difficult to understand.

1578
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
 Jesus Christ asked the disciples,

1579
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
 "Are you not leaving yet?"

1580
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
 The disciples followed Jesus Christ.

1581
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
 Jesus Christ talked about a deeper path,

1582
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
 and they all left.

1583
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
 Jesus Christ asked them,

1584
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
 "Are you not leaving yet?"

1585
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
 Simon Peter answered,

1586
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
 "Lord, you have eternal life.

1587
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
 Who are we to follow?

1588
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
 We have believed and know that you are the Holy One of God."

1589
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
 So Simon Peter stayed with Jesus.

1590
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
 It is not because he thought, "Lord, you can do the work of God.

1591
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
 Lord, you can feed thousands of people.

1592
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
 Lord, you can do the work of God and help us to recover."

1593
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
 Simon Peter answered correctly,

1594
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
 "Lord, you have eternal life.

1595
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
 Who are we to follow?

1596
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
 It is not because he thought, "Lord, you can do the work of God.

1597
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
 Who are we to follow?"

1598
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
 So we are very clear about the teachings of the Bible.

1599
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
 "Lord, you have eternal life.

1600
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
 Who are we to follow?"

1601
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
 I will share with you today.

1602
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
 I hope you understand the relationship between the work of God and truth.

1603
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
 The work of God helps people to point to the truth,

1604
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
 and it has the function of testimony.

1605
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
 But the work of God is not the truth itself.

1606
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
 Faith comes from the hearing,

1607
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
 and the hearing comes from the words of Jesus Christ.

1608
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
 So I hope everyone will read the Bible carefully today,

1609
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
 and understand the words of God,

1610
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
 especially the teachings of Jesus Christ.

1611
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
 I hope the words of God will bless you.

1612
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
 Thank you.
