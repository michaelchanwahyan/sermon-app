1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
(主席向天父致謝)

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
英國有個好出名嘅作家叫做George Orwell

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
喺1950年代呢佢寫過兩本非常有趣嘅小說

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
一本叫1984

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
一本就叫做The Animal Farm

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
1984呢我唔講啦

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
即係我覺得唔係咁精彩啫

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
但係呀The Animal Farm呢係非常精彩嘅一本書

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
呢本書可以從三個唔同嘅層次去睇

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
第一個層次呢係小朋友用嚟做卡通片

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
所以迪士尼呢亦都將呢一個Animal Farm呢

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
係轉為一套嘅卡通片

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
呢個好耐好耐之前我細個時都睇過

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
咁第二個層面呢原來佢唔係講故仔咁簡單

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
原來呢一本書呢佢係諷刺呢個蘇俄嘅革命

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
蘇聯嘅革命佢就一個諷刺

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
佢藉著呢一個嘅寓言嘅方式

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
諷刺呢一個蘇聯嘅一個嘅革命

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
但係更高嘅層次呢

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
其實佢唔單止係諷刺蘇聯嘅革命

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
唔單止諷刺中國嘅革命

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
佢所有嘅革命都係一個諷刺

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
係好多革命開始嘅時候係好有理想

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
但當佢有權有勢嘅時候

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
當佢有位嘅時候就開始腐化

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
跟住我哋就睇一路墮落落去

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
呢本史說講咩呢

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
喺英國有一個農莊

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
個莊主叫Mr. Jones

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
成日掛住飲酒醉昏昏

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
飲完酒就唔會餵豬呀

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
唔會餵牛呀

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
唔會餵牛奶

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
完全唔做

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
一唔開心發起脾氣就拳打腳踢

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
踢嗰啲動物

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
所以嗰啲動物苦不堪言

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
俾呢個Mr. Jones糟蹋到真係好忍唔順

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
當時有一隻豬呢

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
呢隻豬就諗下聰明啲

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
英國人啲豬係聰明嘅

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
我哋中國人啲豬就蠢啲

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
呢隻豬就聰明啦

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
於是就召集所有嗰啲人

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
嗰啲動物出嚟呢

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
就開始秘密會議啦

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
開始呢就係謀求呢

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
有一日呢就推翻呢一個Mr. Jones

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
要成立佢自己獨立嘅國家

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
皇天就不負有心人

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
結果呢

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
有兩隻好聰明嘅豬

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
有啲領導嘅才幹

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
一個叫拿破崙

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
一個叫Snowball

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
呢兩隻豬呢

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
喺領導之下呢

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
就趁住一個晚上

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
呢一個Jones呢

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
飲到醉昏昏嘅時候呢

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
就揭竿起義

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
然後呢就

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
鼓動

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
推動所有嘅動物

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
就將呢個Mr. Jones

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
踢出呢一個動物園

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
趕走佢

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
於是呢就成立咗呢一個動物王國

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
叫The Animal Farm

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
成立國家點算呀

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
第一樣好緊要就咩

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
製造憲法啦

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
有個基本法

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
有個憲法

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
所以佢哋嗱嗱聲開會呢

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
就建立咗一個憲法

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
就將個憲法呢

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
擺喺個農莊嘅前面

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
呢個憲法叫咩

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
七條界命

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
七條界命呢就係我哋

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
立法

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
就係我哋呢一個動物王國嘅

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
最基本法嚟嘅

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
我哋個個都要跟隨嘅

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
呢一個係我哋嘅constitution

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
呢個七條界命係咩界命呢

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
我只係講幾條呢

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
第一條界命係咩呢

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
佢話呢

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
四隻腳係好人

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
兩隻腳係衰人

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Four legs good

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Two legs bad

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
當時嗰啲雞呀

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
嗰啲鴨呀

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
嗰啲鵝一聽到嘅時候呢

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
即刻舉手抗議

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
抗議 抗議 抗議 咁樣

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
咁呢啲豬肉好聰明呀

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
你唔使抗議

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
你有翼㗎嘛係咪

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
你啲翼都係手嚟㗎

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
都係腳嚟㗎

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
你係四腳動物

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
你唔係呢係兩腳動物

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
所以Four legs good係包括你在內㗎

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
咁嗰啲雞話

109
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
好好好

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
啲鴨又好好

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
啲鵝又好好

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
係人先係衰人

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
咁呢個係第一條界命

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
有另外一條界命呢

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
就更加有趣

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
佢話冇一隻動物

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
可以瞓喺床上

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No animal is allowed to sleep on the bed

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
床呢啲嘢呀

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
無論你床褥點樣靚法呢

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
都係屬於人嘅

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
我哋唔開床嘅

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
我哋分地下嘅

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
塔塔米都唔愛嘅

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
所以呢就係呢條界命

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
個個動物覺得啱有道理

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
而最尾一條呢就更加精彩

128
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
所有動物呢都係平等嘅

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All animals are equal

130
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
定立咗呢一個基本法

131
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
定立咗呢一個嘅憲法

132
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
個個好開心

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
咁不止成立咗呢個動物國

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
冇幾耐突然之間

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
歡樂嘅氣氛

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
自由嘅氣氛

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
就突然間唔同咗

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
變得緊張

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
變得個個人呢就喺度恐懼

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
原來呢派系鬥爭

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
我話有兩隻豬

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
一隻係拿破崙

143
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
一隻係snowball

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
呢個snowball同napoleon呢

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
就彼此鬥爭爭位

146
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
呢個拿破崙呢就獨立啲

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
訓練咗嗰啲狼狗

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
就叫特務

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
KGB之類

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
訓練啲狼狗特務

151
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
成日喺度扣住呢一個snowball

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
忽然之間有一日

153
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
報紙出嚟啦

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
動物嘅報紙出嚟

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
snowball失咗蹤

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
於是就謠言滿天飛

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
有啲人話呢個snowball

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
梗係畀個拿破崙捉咗佢呢

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
用嚟制豬扒

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
仲有唔係呀

161
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
可能係嗰啲火腿

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
有啲人話唔係

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
佢偷走咗唔知去邊度

164
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
去加州

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
將來可能返嚟

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
於是就謠言滿天飛

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
個個唔敢講嘢

168
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
一講錯嘢嘅時候呢

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
個狼狗就捉咗佢

170
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
你係反右派嘅

171
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
你係呢一個

172
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
你係屬於snowball派別嘅人

173
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
就捉咗佢坐監

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
於是人間蒸發

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
突然之間本來一個歡樂嘅

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
一個嘅動物王國

177
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
突然之間就緊張

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
個個都係冇呀

179
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
咁動物當中其中有一隻牛呀

180
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
嗰隻牛呢真係唔係蠻牛嚟嘅

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
好老好做得工嘅牛

182
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
叫Mr. Boxer

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
忠心耿耿

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
佢就相信領導

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
佢相信拿破崙

186
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
拿破崙呢所有嘅嘢都好嘅

187
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
佢學習雷鋒叔叔嘅精神

188
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
就一味捐購喺國家上

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
呢個Mr. Boxer老啦

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
開始體力衰退啦

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
開始唔掂啦

192
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
忽然之間有一日

193
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
忽咗鐘

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Mr. Boxer唔見咗啦

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
於是又日日謠言滿天飛

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
有多人話Mr. Boxer去邊度

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
有啲人話我去製造鹹牛肉呀

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
有啲人就話去牛腩呀牛筋呀

199
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
撼爛謠言滿天飛

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
但係從此呢冇人敢再講

201
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
因為呢敢弄而不敢言

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
突然間個國家

203
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
個氣氛

204
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
個情況比喺中史嘅時候

205
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
仲慘呀

206
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
有一日

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
嗰啲動物

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
忽然間聽到個訊息

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
點解唱國歌呢

210
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
又唔係國慶點解國歌呢

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
然後就有喇叭通穿出嚟

212
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
今日係我哋拿破崙領袖嘅生日

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
亦都係將我哋嘅國慶

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
改咗做佢嘅生日上面

215
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
嚟慶祝佢

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
嘩咁都得

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
於是又見下呢個拿破崙

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
佢又食雞蛋

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
又飲牛奶

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
又食芝士

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
咁全部係人一樣

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
跟住冇幾耐官方發表

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
因為領導好辛苦

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
管治你估容易呀

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
佢需要營養呀

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
佢需要食啲牛奶呀

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
需要飲食雞蛋呀

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
食啲芝士

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
先會話嗰啲動物嘩

230
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
有一日動物起身嘅時候

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
發覺

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
喺個動物農莊前面

233
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
嗰個七條界命呢

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
忽然間唔同咗

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
點樣唔同咗呢

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
明明第一條寫住話呢

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
四隻腳係好嘅

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
兩隻腳係衰嘅

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
英文係Four legs good, two legs bad

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
突然間改咗做

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Four legs good, two legs better

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
哇 變畀人改咗啦

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
BAD 變咗 BETTER

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
再睇清楚下第二條

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
冇動物可以瞓喺床嘅

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No animal

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
is allowed to sleep on a bed

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
加上下表句

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Without a sheet

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
冇床單嘅床

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
唔可以瞓

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
最後就最精彩

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
所有動物都係平等嘅

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
但有啲動物更加平等

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
All animals are equal

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But some are more equal than others

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
變哂啦

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
冇幾耐呢

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
拿破崙出嚟

260
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
兩隻腳出嚟

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
呢本書最後佢話

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
我都分唔出邊隻係豬

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
邊啲係人

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
你發覺到啲豬同人呢

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
就溝埋一齊

266
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
玩埋一齊

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
完全冇咗呢個動物王國

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
我讀歷史嘅

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
其實George Orwell 所講

270
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
唔係講故仔嘅

271
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
佢係批判

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
蘇俄嘅革命

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
和札克斯嘅鬥爭

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
佢唔單止係批判蘇聯嘅革命

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
佢亦都係批判

276
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
中國嘅革命

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
同埋所有嘅革命

278
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Philip Yancey

279
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
一個好出名嘅美國作家

280
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
有一次訪問呢個蘇聯真理報嘅主編

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
呢個真理報嘅主編

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
就講咗一句說話

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
佢話我哋共產黨徒

284
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
同你基督徒一樣

285
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
我見到呢個社會好多唔平等

286
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
好多人間嘅疾苦

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
好多唔公義嘅事情

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
所以我哋就決定

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
要建立一個人間嘅天堂

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
我哋就開始咗呢個革命

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
開始咗呢個革命嘅時候

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
推翻

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
但我哋發夢都諗唔到

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
我哋嘅蘇聯政府經過74年嘅事業

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
經過74年嘅事業

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
竟然之間

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
喺我哋國家嘅歷史裏面

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
係製造成一個最恐怖

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
最殘忍嘅政權

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
然後呢一個嘅

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
主編就講咗一句說話

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
我哋而家先發現到

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
政制

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
革命

305
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
唔係可以能夠去改變人嘅道德

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
唯有人心嘅改變

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
生命

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
先至可以改變

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
真係

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
今日我哋所講嘅革命

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
你睇一睇歷史

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
有邊個國家

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
唔係開始嘅時候係滿有理想

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
非常

315
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
宏大的理想

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
但結果

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
好耐以前我睇過一齣戲叫

318
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
《投奔怒海》

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
許鞍華導演

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
其中有一幕

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
有一句說話就好好

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
當越南嘅革命成功

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
個個越共嘅領袖

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
就講咗一句說話

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
我哋國家就革命成功

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
但我個人嘅革命就徹底失敗

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
跟住佢就退隱

328
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
我哋會問

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
歷史我所睇到係乜嘢

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
係乜嘢可以改變人嘅生命

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
係咪靠一啲嘅政制

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
係咪靠一啲嘅

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
一啲嘅

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
獎勵就可以改變人嘅生命

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
係咪

336
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
今日點樣可以

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
真係過到平安夜

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
生命

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
點樣先可以真正有

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
平靜安穩

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
真正嘅平安夜係邊度

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
正經話畀你聽

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
耶穌基督嘅革命

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
係一個最徹底嘅革命

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
而佢歌頌耶穌基督嘅革命

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
係第一首聖詩

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
第一首聖詩就係瑪利亞所唱

348
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
瑪利亞所唱嘅呢一首

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
聖詩就記載喺路加福音第一章

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
46節至到

351
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
58節

352
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
瑪利亞嘅歌頌

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
46節至到49節

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
路加福音第一章

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
46節至56節稱為瑪利亞

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
專主頌

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
呢一首歌通常我哋叫

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
專主頌英文呢叫

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Magnificat

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
呢個字係一個拉丁文翻譯過嚟嘅

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
係由一個叫

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Magaluna呢個字嚟嘅呢個係希臘文嚟嘅

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Magaluna呢個字咩意思呢

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
呢個字呢亦都英文叫

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Magnify即係擴大或者係

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
尊重係極之崇洋

367
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
讚美咁嘅意思

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
原來係一首讚美詩

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
係瑪利亞知道

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
有新人陀住耶穌基督嘅時候

371
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
佢就不禁歡喜到

372
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
去張揚到

373
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
唱出呢一首歌叫做

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
專主頌原來路加福音裏面

375
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
有四首歌係非常重要

376
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
都係同呢一個耶穌嘅出生

377
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
好有關係嘅第一個叫做係46節

378
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
至到56節叫專主頌

379
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Magnificat就係瑪利亞

380
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
第二就叫

381
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Benedictus 拉丁文嚟嘅

382
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Benedictus呢個字係一張

383
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
68節至到79節

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
就係撒加利亞所唱嘅叫以色列頌

385
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
第三個呢叫

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Gloria in Excelsis

387
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
係叫榮耀頌

388
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
就係二張14節

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
最落咩呢就叫西面就叫

390
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Narc Dimitris 第二張29節32節

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
所有呢四首詩

392
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
拉丁文呢我哋叫做

393
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Enel Enel咩意思呢

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
可以唱可以歌頌

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
係歌頌耶穌基督嘅出生

396
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
今日我哋主要係睇呢個專主頌

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
專主頌係分咗三部份

398
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
第一部份

399
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
係瑪利亞

400
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
佢知道佢

401
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
新人係從聖靈

402
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
懷孕而你所懷嘅胎

403
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
就係呢個救世主嘅時候

404
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
佢不禁去讚美上帝

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
呢個係46節至79節

406
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
第二段就係

407
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
講到出世呢位耶穌基督

408
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
出世呢位耶穌基督

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
佢帶嚟嘅係一個徹頭徹底嘅革命

410
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
係耶穌基督嘅革命

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
係54節至56節

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
最後

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
50節至53節

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
最後耶穌基督嘅救贖大功

415
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
係乜嘢人先可以得著

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
就係54節至56節

417
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
首先我哋睇第一段

418
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
46節至49節

419
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
瑪利亞說我心尊主為大

420
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
我寧以我的神救主為樂

421
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
因為他顧念他使類的卑微

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
從今以後萬代要稱我有福

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
那有權能的

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
為我成就了大事

425
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
他的名為聖

426
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
如果我哋要明白

427
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
呢段聖經嘅背景

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
我可以做一個咁嘅比喻

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
我哋喺最最後一會嘅時候

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
突然間

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
美國政府派咗

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
一啲重要高級人

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
就嚟到我呢度

434
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
然後佢就宣佈

435
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
話我哋美國人發覺

436
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
特朗普

437
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
都唔係好適宜做我哋美國總統

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
所以我哋決定呢

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
呢個幾個委員會

440
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
呢幾個elector

441
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
決定搵

442
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Mr. Jason Wong

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
做我哋嘅

444
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
美國總統

445
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
代替咗

446
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Donald Trump

447
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Jason 你有咩感受

448
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
佢真係黑零頭

449
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
佢真係話

450
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
我唔得嘅

451
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
我無得 我無能

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
又唔係人民選出嚟

453
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
點得呀

454
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
嗰個心情就係

455
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
馬利亞嘅心情

456
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
當天使報信話

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
我報給你一個大喜嘅訊息

458
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
就係你要懷孕生子

459
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
呢個係救世主

460
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
馬利亞就話

461
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
我係咩人呀

462
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
我無得無能

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
我只不過係個痞女

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
但係既然上帝要用我

465
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
成就一個咁大嘅革命嘅時候

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
我唔單止係恐懼裏面

467
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
戰經裏面

468
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
我存住感謝嘅心

469
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
願上帝嘅革命能夠成就

470
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
畀我有滿足嘅快樂

471
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
呢個就係咁嘅意思

472
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
所以喺呢一段聖經裏面

473
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
我哋睇到

474
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
馬利亞唱嘅時候

475
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
係好個人性

476
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
佢唔係公式化

477
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
佢唔係唸台詞

478
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
佢唔係背書

479
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
係好個人性

480
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
好有感情

481
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
一開始嘅時候

482
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
我心尊主為大

483
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
尊主為大呢個字

484
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
嘩好犀利

485
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
我心尊主為大

486
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
尊主為大

487
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
即係話

488
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
我極之開心

489
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
點樣尊崇你

490
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
係我嘅靈

491
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
係我嘅心

492
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
修奇

493
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
靈係人嘅心裏面

494
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
最深處嘅地方

495
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
係最純真的地方

496
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
我係從我心底裏面

497
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
去發出我最喜樂嘅歡聲

498
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
神下

499
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
我係乜水呀

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
你幾年之間

501
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
去使用我

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
你幾年之間

503
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
你嘅工具

504
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
事實上都係

505
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
有時我諗下我自己

506
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
最近我返香港

507
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
同我太太

508
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
同我女

509
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
同我孫

510
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
同埋一個外孫

511
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
返香港

512
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
主要原因就係因為我畢業啦

513
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
我退咗休之後就返香港大學讀書

514
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
咁呀

515
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
畢業啦

516
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
咁就問我

517
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
你有咩感受呀

518
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
全體當中呢

519
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
我係年紀最大嘅一個

520
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
七十歲先畢業

521
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
但我諗返下

522
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
我都唔知我自己點解可以畢到業

523
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
你問我

524
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
真係完全唔知道自己點解畢到業

525
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
畢到業

526
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
喺我研究嘅過程裏面呢

527
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
有好多時候

528
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
棘手 突然之間

529
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
就有啲資料出嚟

530
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
解答咗我嘅問題

531
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
有時需要啲歷史

532
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
有時需要啲口述歷史

533
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
口述歷史即係要訪問下

534
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
因為我讀中國近代史

535
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
咁最好就搵到嗰啲

536
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
而家再生嗰啲人

537
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
我發夢都諗唔到

538
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
我竟然之間

539
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
可以搵到咁嘅人

540
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
去畀我訪問

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
我走到去中國訪問一個95歲嘅老牧師

542
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
佢就正正係我研究裏面

543
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
其中一個好重要嘅一環

544
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
佢話畀我哋聽

545
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
95歲仲清醒

546
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
而且係頭腦非常清醒

547
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
更加我自己拗頭

548
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
我講嗰啲普通話

549
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
佢可以聽得明

550
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
佢講嗰啲普通話

551
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
我又聽得明

552
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
真係奇怪

553
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
所以真係唔能夠唔服曬上帝嘅安排

554
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
我訪問咗佢唔夠幾個月

555
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
佢就返咗天賦道

556
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
遲幾個月都搞唔掂

557
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
就畀我

558
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
帶畀我一啲突破

559
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
喺研究裏面

560
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
一啲突破

561
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
即係我諗返下

562
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
我係乜水

563
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
點解我能夠可以去侍奉

564
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
我有乜水可以站喺呢個講台裏面

565
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
同大家分享

566
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
毫無所誇

567
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
唯一就好似瑪麗亞講

568
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
我係乜嘢

569
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
我只不過係侍女

570
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
中文譯個侍女亦都好

571
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
太靚

572
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
侍女人哋覺得話侍女好

573
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
希臘文個douly個字

574
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
最好譯咗係乜

575
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
妹仔

576
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
我係妹仔

577
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
瀑皮

578
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
我係卑微

579
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
一個咁卑微

580
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
一個咁樣人

581
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
上帝都可以用

582
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
我哋只能夠講一句說話

583
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
上帝你係得

584
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
保羅講得好啱

585
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
如果要誇誇我哋嘅軟弱

586
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
我哋要約上一大籃章犬

587
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
出嚟

588
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
當文牧師叫你侍奉

589
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
你唔好話

590
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
我唔得

591
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
你唔得所以要侍奉

592
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
如果你覺得你自己得

593
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
上帝唔會

594
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
卑微嘅就升高

595
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
高就要降低

596
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
所以你睇到呢段聖經

597
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
係一個好重要嘅個人性

598
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
仲有呢段聖經係承先啟後

599
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
呢段聖經同

600
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
上帝二章哈拿嘅詩歌

601
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
係好相似

602
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
係表示

603
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
上帝嘅恩典

604
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
叫瑪利亞可以抬起她的胎

605
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
而且你再嚟睇一睇瑪利亞嘅歌

606
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
裏面好有趣

607
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
你研讀呢段聖經

608
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
你發覺啱我個頭

609
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
46節

610
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
我心尊主為大

611
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
個尊主嘅尊字

612
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
係用現在式嘅

613
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
希臘文文法係現在式嘅

614
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
47節

615
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
我靈以我嘅教主為浪

616
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
係用過去式嘅

617
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
48節

618
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
撻古念斯里的卑微

619
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
係過去式嘅

620
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
48節

621
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
從今以後萬代稱我為有福

622
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
係將來式嘅future tense

623
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
如果我係老師

624
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
改呢篇文嘅時候

625
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
我就呃我個頭

626
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
你搞乜鬼架

627
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
得閒又用下過去式

628
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
講而家嘅嘢

629
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
點解你用到亂哂大籠

630
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
但係呢

631
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
如果我係咁批評呢

632
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
我就唔識嘢

633
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
原來係希臘文文法裏面

634
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
有一個文法叫做

635
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Ingressive Errors

636
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Ingressive Errors 即係係過去式

637
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
但係個Ingressive Errors

638
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
係咩意思

639
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
係講一個好重要嘅事實

640
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
呢個字嘅意思

641
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
即係話呢

642
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
我過咗之後就會繼續去

643
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
英文可以咁講

644
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
有啲人呢咁翻譯

645
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I have begun to enter into

646
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
the age of praise

647
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
係由呢度開始

648
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
啟開一個新嘅時代

649
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
由呢度開始

650
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
一個新嘅時代係唔同

651
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
原來耶穌基督降生

652
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
係啟開一個新嘅時代

653
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
係完全唔同

654
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
呢首第一首聖詩係話畀你聽

655
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
耶穌基督啟開一個新嘅時代

656
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
時間嚟了

657
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
呢個係咩時代

658
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
革命

659
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
跟住喺第50至53節

660
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
耶穌基督講過

661
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
三個革命

662
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
邊三個革命

663
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
第一個係道德嘅革命

664
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
第二個係社會嘅革命

665
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
第三個

666
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
係經濟嘅革命

667
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
首先你睇一睇

668
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
乜嘢係叫做社會嘅革命

669
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
他憐憫敬畏他的人

670
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
直到世世代代

671
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
他用蚌尾施展大能

672
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
打狂傲嘅正心裡妄想

673
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
就被他趕散了

674
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
他叫有權柄的失位

675
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
要卑微的高升

676
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
耶穌基督嚟到

677
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
係反轉整個世界

678
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
再高嘅要降低

679
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
再低嘅要升高

680
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
或者你會問

681
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
邊度係呀

682
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
邊度係呀

683
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
唔係呀

684
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
你諗一諗

685
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
我係香港嚟

686
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
香港就有好多嗰啲

687
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
嗰啲會呀

688
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
馬會呀

689
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
你加入嗰啲會呢

690
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
個身份就唔同

691
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
我以為呢

692
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
我唔知

693
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
有朋友話請你去馬會

694
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
食飯啦咁去馬會

695
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
我以為馬會呢就咁就馬會囉

696
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
我以為最多要加入會費

697
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
30萬都好犀利

698
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
你知唔知而家加入馬會要幾錢

699
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
香港馬會呀

700
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
有冇人知呀

701
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
有冇人係馬會嘅會員

702
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
冇呀

703
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
有冇你啲朋友係馬會嘅會員

704
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
你知唔知加入馬會嘅會

705
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
要幾錢呀

706
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
300萬呀

707
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
仲要排長龍呀

708
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
咁我唔去馬會呀

709
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
我去其他會得唔得呀

710
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
有扶輪社呀

711
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
獅子會呀

712
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
九龍塘會所呀

713
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
如果你係香港黎就知道好多呢啲會所

714
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
九龍塘業主會所呀

715
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
每個會所都有俱樂部呀

716
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
全部都係乜嘢

717
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
要加會費幾十萬㗎

718
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
或者百幾萬

719
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
所以去嗰啲多數係嗰啲同等人士

720
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
我想問呀

721
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
去教會使唔使加會費

722
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
因為我都係同等人士

723
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
所以我想問呀

724
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
去教會使唔使加會費

725
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
唔使喎

726
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
教會係一個好奇怪嘅地方

727
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
你諗下真係好奇怪

728
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
尤其是你諗下

729
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
係耶穌基督嘅時代呀

730
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
教會真係好奇怪呀

731
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
嗰陣時仲有奴隸制度㗎

732
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
奴隸係冇生死權係畀個主人嘅

733
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
主人操縱晒呀

734
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
點知奴隸有一日信咗耶穌

735
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
去咗教會

736
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
做咗主人學老師添

737
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
咁冇幾耐呢

738
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
佢嘅主人又信咗耶穌

739
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
又去到教會又做佢主人學嘅學生

740
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
喺屋企

741
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
就係主人同埋奴僕

742
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
去到教會就係老師同埋主人學

743
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
喂你冇背金句呀

744
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
你返去快啲要背金句呀

745
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
咁呢個主人

746
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
返到去佢都唔敢砌

747
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
即係你發覺

748
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
佢將成個嘅社會嘅秩序嘅規矩

749
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
調曬嚟呀

750
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
調亂曬啦

751
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
喺個教會裏面

752
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
可能好有錢好有地位

753
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
好崇高地位嘅人

754
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
一個係好卑微

755
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
係奴隸嚟嘅

756
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
佢可以手揸手稱叫做弟兄姊妹

757
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
一同嘅唱詩

758
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
你喺扶輪社搵唔到㗎

759
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
你馬會搵唔到㗎

760
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
你喺任何地方搵唔到㗎

761
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
喺教會你會搵到

762
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
就因為耶穌幾多個革命

763
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
叫在位嘅要降低

764
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
再低嘅就要升高

765
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
稱為弟兄姊妹

766
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
好奇怪呀

767
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
我諗返我哋香港嘅教會呀

768
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
農舍混雜但係呢

769
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
無論農又好舍我喺上帝睇嚟都係

770
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
全部係農嚟㗎

771
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
有啲係好叻嘅讀書呀

772
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
有啲係完全

773
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
即係

774
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
小學一二年級畢業嘅

775
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
有啲係好有錢嘅

776
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
有啲好窮

777
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
但係喺教會裏面

778
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
無分呢啲嘢嘅

779
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
就好似保羅話

780
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
喺基督裏面無分自主無分為奴嘅

781
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
無分你係咩

782
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
我理得你係咩學位

783
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
你係點樣西理法

784
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
無人知

785
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
我哋只係知道一樣嘢

786
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
專主為大

787
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
呢個咪就係聖經裏面所講嘅

788
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
革命呢個就係

789
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
耶穌佢都所講嘅

790
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
去施展傍臂大能嘅

791
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
叫在上嘅要降低

792
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
大低嘅升高

793
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
你睇下耶穌點樣講話

794
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
趕散失圍升高

795
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
得飽未食空手回

796
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
全部呢啲字

797
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
都係話畀我哋聽

798
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
係耶穌幾多個革命帶嚟個結果

799
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
仲有你再睇一睇第52節

800
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
佢叫有權柄嘅失圍

801
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
叫卑賤嘅升高

802
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
今日個世界

803
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
最大嘅問題係咩

804
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
世界最大嘅問題就係

805
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
要要要

806
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
有等位

807
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
我哋中國人呢

808
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
喺春秋

809
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
戰國嘅時候亂曬大龍

810
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
孔夫子話唔得一定要

811
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
有等位

812
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
五鄰君臣

813
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
夫子兄弟夫婦朋友

814
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
君要臣死

815
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
臣不死是為不忠

816
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
父要子亡子不亡是為不孝

817
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
一定要咁樣嘅規矩

818
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
有order先有order

819
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
咁樣出嚟

820
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
基督教可以睇一視同仁

821
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
個個都係按照上帝嘅形象

822
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
所做但我哋仍然可以

823
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
喺耶穌基督嘅領導之下

824
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
能夠平安夜

825
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
OK

826
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
53節更加話畀你聽

827
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
佢唔單止帶嚟個社會嘅革命

828
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
唔單止帶嚟

829
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
道德嘅革命

830
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
帶嚟一個嘅經濟嘅革命

831
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
咁你話拗口咩叫經濟革命

832
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
53節叫飢餓的得飽未食

833
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
叫富足的空手會

834
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
叫富足的空手會

835
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
你睇下今日呢個世界

836
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
你睇下今日呢個世界

837
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
今日呢個世界

838
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
今日呢個世界

839
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
唔係唔夠食物

840
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
食物分唔勻

841
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
唔係唔夠資源

842
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
食物分唔勻

843
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
有錢嘅就好有錢

844
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
窮嘅就好窮

845
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
如果我哋將今日整個世界

846
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
分為成為一個

847
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
100人嘅村落

848
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
呢100人當中有33個

849
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
係叫做有錢嘅

850
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
67個係窮嘅

851
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
窮到一日一餐都未必得嘅

852
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
個33個

853
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
有錢係佔咗全條先

854
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
全條村90%嘅財產

855
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
90%嘅食物

856
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
其中

857
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
呢33個有7個

858
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
係特別有錢

859
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
佢哋揼落去垃圾桶嘅食物

860
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
足可以揼活咗

861
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
66%

862
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
嗰啲窮人

863
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
佢哋擁有嘅財產

864
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
係佔咗成個世界

865
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
一個好大嘅比率

866
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
中國人所謂不患寡

867
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
而患不均

868
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
道夫講一首詩句裏面

869
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
我諗好真嘅

870
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
今日嘅情況

871
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
豬門走肉臭

872
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
驢猶動死骨

873
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
有啲就

874
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
有啲就好有錢

875
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
食到嘢都臭晒

876
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
有啲窮到

877
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
無飯食

878
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
餓食

879
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
今日我哋嘅世界就係咁

880
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
但聖經話畀你聽

881
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
如果

882
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
我哋有耶穌基督嘅心

883
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
喺裏面

884
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
連率嘅心

885
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
我哋可唔可以

886
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
能夠

887
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
進一個咁樣嘅情況

888
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
我諗返我自己

889
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
1950年代

890
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
我喺香港長大

891
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
我讀二年級嘅時候我記得一件事

892
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
我而家印象到好深刻

893
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
就我阿爸帶我出街食飯

894
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
好少出街食飯

895
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
嗰次特別例外

896
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
唔知佢生日就咩帶我出街食飯

897
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
食飯嘅時候

898
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
我就見到餐館裏面

899
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
其實我食飯係大排檔

900
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
見到有一個男人四十幾歲

901
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
三個細路

902
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
兩個女一個仔

903
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
都係好細個

904
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
帶到入去個餐館嗰度

905
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
然後

906
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
就唱一首埋唱

907
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
唱一首歌

908
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
然後就喺周圍每一排裏面

909
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
唔係黑錢

910
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
你食剩嗰啲嘢

911
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
可唔可以嚟畀我哋食

912
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
50年

913
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
初期嘅香港

914
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
好貧窮

915
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
跟住我爸爸就同我講一句說話

916
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
你知唔知道

917
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
我哋每日都有飯食

918
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
唔使走嚟到黑

919
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
係咩緣故

920
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
我話唔知

921
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
我爸爸就同我講

922
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
我喺孤兒院做

923
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
個孤兒院係美國人

924
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
西教授去香港開設嘅一個孤兒院

925
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
我哋每日食嘅

926
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
係嗰啲基督徒

927
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
愛心奉獻出嚟嘅麵

928
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
麵粉

929
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
大米

930
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
以致我哋

931
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
可以喺呢個孤兒院裏面

932
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
長大

933
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
呢個就叫分量

934
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
基督教好強調一樣

935
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
施比受更為有福

936
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
今日我哋有冇諗過

937
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
耶穌基督所畀我哋

938
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
你見到一個人

939
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
冇飯食你畀飯佢食

940
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
你見到人冇衫著畀衫佢著

941
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
當日將來見面嘅時候

942
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
耶穌就話

943
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
我坐監嘅時候你嚟探我

944
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
我飢餓嘅時候你嚟畀我食

945
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
我冇衫著嘅時候你畀衫我著

946
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
呢個義人話

947
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
耶穌冇話我冇做過我冇見過你

948
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
耶穌話你做喺一個小子身上

949
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
即係做喺我身上

950
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
聖誕節係一個分享

951
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
我諗過今日

952
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
喺世界裏面仲有好多人

953
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
係一個嘅

954
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
仍然係一個掙扎

955
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
美國可能好多人

956
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
都係一個掙扎

957
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
美國可能好富庶

958
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
係迷路

959
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
美國亦都係一個貧富

960
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
好懸殊嘅地方

961
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
今日喺唐人房裏面有幾多人

962
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
係新移民裏面仲有好大嘅掙扎

963
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
係幾多個老人家

964
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
喺個單房裏面仍然

965
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
喺個

966
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
管間房裏面仍然有好多嘅掙扎

967
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
好孤單

968
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
有邊個去理會

969
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
邊個會體諒

970
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
有邊個去諗一諗

971
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
今日我哋需要將耶穌基督呢一個革命帶畀周圍嘅人

972
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
第54至56節

973
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
聖經就話畀你聽

974
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
係有一種人

975
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
呢種係咩嘢

976
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
就係他扶助他的僕人

977
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
以色列

978
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
為要紀念阿伯諾罕默他的後裔

979
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
乜嘢嘅人先可以嘗到呢個革命

980
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
只有一種人

981
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
就係以色列人

982
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
以色列人唔係血統嘅以色列人

983
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
係屬靈嘅以色列人

984
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
憑著相信耶穌基督

985
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
接受耶穌基督

986
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
喺我哋生命裏面嘅

987
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
真以色列人

988
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
今日你有冇嘗過耶穌基督

989
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
呢個畀我哋嘅

990
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
大嘅喜樂

991
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
我有冇嘗過耶穌基督嘅救恩

992
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
今日仲有好多人

993
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
喺救恩嘅門外

994
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
我哋冇諗過將呢個福音帶畀佢哋

995
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
學主憐憫我哋

996
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
將佢心底同我哋同佢報告

997
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
天父我哋再一次多謝你

998
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
畀你寶貴嘅話語

999
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
去提醒我哋

1000
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
畀我哋明白聖誕嘅真義

1001
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
我哋多謝你

1002
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
我哋紀念到午堂嘅時候

1003
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
有報道會

1004
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
求你藉由呢個報道會

1005
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
叫一啲未信嘅朋友都有機會認識你

1006
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
祝福引領我哋

1007
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
多謝你

1008
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
祈禱奉耶穌基督名求
