1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
(祝福)

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
英國有個好出名嘅作家叫Jorge Orwell

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
喺1950年代去寫過兩本非常有趣嘅小說

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
一本叫1984,一本就叫The Animal Farm

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
1984呢我唔講啦,我覺得唔係咁精彩啫

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
但係The Animal Farm係非常精彩嘅一本書

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
呢本書可以從三個唔同嘅層次去睇

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
第一個層次係小朋友用嚟做卡通片

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
所以迪士尼亦都將呢一個Animal Farm轉為一套卡通片

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
呢個好耐好耐之前我細嗰陣時都睇過

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
第二個層面原來佢唔係淨係講故仔咁簡單

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
原來呢一本書佢係諷刺蘇俄嘅革命

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
蘇聯嘅革命佢係一個諷刺

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
佢藉著呢一個預言嘅方式諷刺蘇聯嘅革命

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
但係更高嘅層次呢其實佢唔單止係諷刺蘇聯嘅革命

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
唔單止係諷刺中國嘅革命

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
佢所有嘅革命都係一個諷刺

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
係好多革命開始嘅時候係好有理想

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
但當佢有權有勢嘅時候當佢有慰嘅時候就開始腐化

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
跟住我哋就睇一路墮落落去

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
呢本史說咩呢?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
喺英國有一個農莊

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
個莊主叫Mr. Jones成日掛住飲酒醉昏昏

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
飲完酒唔會餵豬呀唔會餵牛呀唔會餵又唔會揸牛奶

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
完全都唔做啦

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
一唔開心發起脾氣呢就拳打腳踢

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
踢嗰啲動物所以嗰啲動物苦不堪言

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
畀Mr. Jones遭質到真係好忍唔順

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
當時有一隻豬呢隻豬就諗下

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
聰明啲啦

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
英國人嘅豬就聰明

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
我哋中國人嘅豬就蠢啲

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
咁呢隻豬就聰明

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
於是就召集所有嗰啲人

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
實際嗰啲動物出嚟

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
就開始秘密會議

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
開始集會

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
開始謀求有一日推翻Mr. Jones

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
要成立佢自己獨立嘅國家

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
王天不負有心人

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
結果呢

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
有兩隻好聰明嘅豬

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
有領導嘅財幹

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
一個叫拿破崙

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
一個叫Snowball

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
呢兩隻豬呢

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
喺領導之下呢

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
就趁住一個晚上

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
呢一個中士呢

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
飲到醉昏昏嘅時候呢

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
就揭竿起義

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
然後呢就

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
鼓動推動所有嘅動物

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
就將呢個Mr. Jones

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
踢出呢一個動物園

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
趕走佢

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
於是呢

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
就成立咗呢一個動物王國

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
叫The Animal Farm

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
成立個國家點算呀

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
第一樣好緊要咗咩

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
製造憲法啦

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
有個基本法

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
有個憲法

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
所以佢哋

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
喇啦聲開會呢

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
就建立咗一個憲法

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
就將個憲法

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
擺喺個農莊嘅前面

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
呢個憲法叫咩

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
七條誡命

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
七條誡命呢

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
就係我哋立法

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
就係我哋呢一個動物王國嘅

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
最基本法嚟嘅

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
我哋個個都要跟隨嘅

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
呢一個係我哋嘅Constitution

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
呢個七條誡命

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
係咩誡命呢

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
我只係講幾條呢

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
第一條誡命係咩呢

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
佢話呢

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
四隻腳係好人

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
兩隻腳係衰人

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Four legs good

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Two legs bad

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
當時嗰啲雞呀

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
嗰啲鴨呀

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
嗰啲鵝呀

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
嗰啲鵝一聽到嘅時候呢

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
即刻舉手抗議抗議抗議抗議

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
咁呢隻豬好聰明呀

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
你唔使抗議

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
你有翼㗎嘛

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
你啲翼都係手嚟㗎

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
都係腳嚟㗎

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
你係四腳動物

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
你唔係

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
你唔係呢

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
係兩腳動物

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
所以Four legs good

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
包括你再耐㗎

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
嗰啲雞話

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
好好喎

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
嗰啲鴨又好

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
嗰啲鵝又好

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
係人先係衰人喎

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
呢個係第一條誡命

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
有另外一條誡命呢

110
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
就更加有趣

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
佢話冇一隻動物

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
可以放喺床上

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No animal is allowed to sleep on the bed

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
呢床呢啲嘢呀

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
無論啲床中點樣靚法呢

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
都係屬於人嘅

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
我哋唔愛床嘅

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
我哋分地下嘅

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
塌塌米都唔愛嘅

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
所以呢就係呢條誡命

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
個個動物覺得

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
啱有道理

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
最多呢條呢就更加精彩

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
所有動物呢都係平等嘅

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All animals are equal

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
定立咗呢個基本法

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
定立咗呢個嘅憲法

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
個個好開心

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
點不止成立咗呢個動物

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
唔好幾耐呢

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
突然之間歡樂嘅氣氛

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
自由嘅氣氛

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
就突然間唔同咗

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
變得緊張

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
變得個個人呢就喺度恐懼

136
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
原來呢

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
派系鬥爭

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
我話有兩隻豬

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
一隻係拿破崙

140
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
一隻係Snowball

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
呢個Snowball同係Lapoleon

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
就彼此鬥爭

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
爭位

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
呢個拿破崙呢就獨立啲

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
就訓練咗嗰啲狼狗

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
就叫做特務KGB之類

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
訓練呢啲狼狗特務

148
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
成日喺度hold住呢個Snowball

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
忽然之間有一日

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
動物嘅報紙出嚟

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Snowball失咗鐘

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
於是又謠言滿天飛

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
有啲人話呢個Snowball

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
梗係畀個拿破崙捉咗佢

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
用嚟製豬扒

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
話仲有唔係

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
可能係嗰啲火腿

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
有啲人話唔係

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
佢偷走咗唔知去邊度

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
去加州

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
將來可能返嚟

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
於是就謠言滿天飛

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
個個唔敢講嘢

164
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
一講錯嘢嘅時候呢個狼狗

165
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
走嚟捉咗佢

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
你係反右派嘅

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
你係屬於Snowball派別嘅人

168
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
捉咗佢坐監

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
於是人間蒸發

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
突然之間本來一個歡樂嘅

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
一個嘅動物王國

172
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
忽然之間緊張

173
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
個個都係冇

174
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
動物當中其中有一隻牛

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
個隻牛真係唔係盲牛嚟嘅

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
好老好做得工嘅牛

177
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
叫Mr. Boxer

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
忠心緊緊

179
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
佢相信領導

180
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
佢相信拿破崙

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
拿破崙所有嘅嘢都好嘅

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
佢學習雷鋒叔叔嘅精神

183
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
一味捐佢喺國家上

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mr. Boxer老啦

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
開始體力衰退

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
開始唔掂啦

187
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
忽然之間有一日

188
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
忽咗鐘

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Mr. Boxer唔見咗啦

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
於是又有謠言滿天飛

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
有好多人話

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr. Boxer係邊度

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
有啲人話

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
我哋製造鹹牛肉

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
有啲人就話

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
我哋做牛腩牛筋

197
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
撼爛謠言滿天飛

198
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
但從此冇人敢再講

199
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
因為敢弄而不敢言

200
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
突然間個國家

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
個氣氛個情況

202
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
比喺中史嘅時候

203
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
仲慘

204
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
有一日

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
嗰啲動物

206
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
忽然間聽到個訊息

207
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
點解唱國歌

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
又唔係國慶點解國歌

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
然後就有喇叭通出嚟

210
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
今日係我哋拿破崙

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
領袖嘅生日

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
亦都係將我哋國慶改咗到

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
佢嘅生日上面

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
慶祝佢

215
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
咁都得

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
於是又見下

217
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
呢個拿破崙

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
佢又食雞蛋

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
又飲牛奶

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
又食芝士

221
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
全部係人一樣

222
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
跟住冇幾耐官方發表

223
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
因為領導好辛苦

224
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
管治你估容易

225
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
佢需要營養

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
佢需要食啲牛奶

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
需要飲食啲雞蛋

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
食啲芝士

229
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
啲樣

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
嗰啲動物話好好好

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
有一日動物起身嘅時候

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
發覺

233
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
喺個動物裝

234
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
農莊前面個個七條界命

235
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
突然間唔同咗

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
點解唔同咗

237
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
明明第一條寫住話

238
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
四隻腳係好嘅

239
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
兩隻腳係衰嘅

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
英文係Four legs good

241
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Two legs bad

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
突然間改咗做

243
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Four legs good

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Two legs better

245
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
邊俾人改咗啦

246
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
BAD變咗BETTER

247
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
再睇清楚下第二條

248
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
冇動物可以瞓喺床嘅

249
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No animal is allowed to sleep on a bed

250
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
家邊下比句

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Without a sheet

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
冇床單嘅床唔可以瞓

253
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
最Line最精彩

254
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
所有動物都係平等嘅

255
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
但有啲動物更加平等

256
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
All animals are equal

257
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But some are more equal than others

258
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
變曬

259
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
冇幾耐呢

260
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
拿破崙出嚟

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
出嚟嘅時候係咩呀

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
兩隻腳出嚟

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
呢本書最Line句話

264
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
我都分唔出邊隻係豬

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
邊啲係人

266
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
你發覺到

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
嗰啲豬同人呢

268
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
就溝埋一齊

269
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
玩埋一齊

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
完全

271
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
冇咗呢個動物王國

272
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
我係讀歷史嘅

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
其實George Orwell所講

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
唔係講故仔

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
佢係批判蘇俄嘅革命

276
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
史太林和Trosky嘅鬥爭

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
佢唔單止係批判蘇聯嘅革命

278
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
佢亦都係批判中國嘅革命

279
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
同埋所有嘅革命

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Philip Jenss

281
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
一個好出名嘅美國作家

282
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
有一次訪問呢個蘇聯真理部嘅主編

283
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
呢個真理部嘅主編

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
就講咗一句話

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
佢話我哋共產黨徒

286
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
同你基督徒一樣

287
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
我見到呢個社會好多唔平等

288
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
好多人間嘅疾苦

289
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
好多唔公義嘅事情

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
所以我哋就決定要建立一個人間嘅天堂

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
我哋就開始咗呢個革命

292
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
開始咗呢個革命嘅時候

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
推翻

294
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
但我哋發夢都諗唔到

295
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
我哋個蘇聯政府經過74年嘅事業

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
係竟然之間

297
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
喺我哋國家嘅歷史裏面

298
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
係製造成為一個最恐怖

299
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
最殘忍嘅政權

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
然後呢一個嘅主編就講咗句話

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
我哋而家先發現到

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
政制革命

303
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
唔係可以能夠去改變人嘅道德

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
唯有人心嘅改變

305
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
生命先至可以改變

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
真係

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
今日我哋所講嘅革命

308
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
你睇一睇歷史

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
有邊個國家

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
唔係開始嘅時候滿有理想

311
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
非常宏大的理想

312
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
但結果

313
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
好耐以前我睇過一齣戲叫投奔怒海

314
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
許鞍華導演

315
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
其中有一句話就好好

316
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
當越南嘅革命成功

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
個個越共嘅領袖就講咗一句話

318
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
我哋國家就革命成功

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
但我個人嘅革命就徹底失敗

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
跟住佢就退役

321
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
我哋會問

322
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
在歷史我哋所睇到係乜嘢

323
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
係乜嘢可以去改變人嘅生命

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
係咪靠一啲嘅政制

325
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
係咪靠一啲嘅

326
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
一些嘅獎勵就可以去改變人嘅生命

327
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
係咪

328
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
今日

329
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
點樣可以真係過到平安夜

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
生命

331
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
點樣先可以真正有平靜安穩

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
真正嘅平安夜係邊度

333
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
聖經話畀我哋聽

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
耶穌基督嘅革命

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
係個最徹底嘅革命

336
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
而佢歌頌耶穌基督嘅革命係第一首聖詩

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
第一首聖詩就係馬尼亞所唱

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
馬尼亞所唱嘅呢首聖詩

339
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
就記住係路加福音第一章

340
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
46節至到58節

341
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
首先我哋睇一睇馬尼亞嘅歌頌

342
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
46節至到49節

343
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
路加福音第一章46節至56節

344
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
稱為馬尼亞叫尊主頌

345
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
呢首歌通常我哋叫尊主頌

346
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
英文叫Manifacate

347
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
原來Manifacate呢個字係一個拉丁文翻譯過嚟嘅

348
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
係由於一個叫McGonagallina呢個字嚟嘅

349
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
呢個係希臘文嚟嘅

350
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
McGonagallina呢個字係咩意思呢

351
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
呢個字亦都叫Magnify

352
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
即係擴大

353
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
或者係尊尊

354
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
係極之崇洋

355
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
讚美咁嘅意思

356
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
原來係一首讚美先

357
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
係馬尼亞知道佢有新人

358
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
陀住耶穌基督嘅時候

359
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
佢就不禁歡喜到去

360
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
張若東唱出呢一首歌

361
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
叫做尊主頌

362
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
然後路加福音裏面有四首歌係非常重要

363
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
都係同呢一個耶穌嘅出生好有關係

364
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
第一個叫46節至到56節

365
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
叫尊主頌Manifacate

366
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
就係馬尼亞

367
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
第二呢就叫Benedictus

368
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
係拉丁文嚟嘅

369
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Benedictus呢個字係錄一章

370
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
68節至到79節

371
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
就係沙加利亞所唱嘅

372
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
叫以色列頌

373
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
第三呢叫Gloria in excelsis

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
係叫榮耀頌

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
就係二章14節

376
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
最後呢就叫西面就叫Nucleus Demetrius

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
就係二章29至32節

378
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
所有呢四首詩

379
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
拉丁文呢我哋叫做Eneo

380
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Eneo係咩意思呢

381
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Eneo就係可以唱

382
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
可以歌頌

383
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
係歌頌耶穌基督嘅出生

384
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
今日我哋主要係睇呢個尊主頌

385
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
尊主頌係分咗三部分

386
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
第一部分係馬尼亞

387
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
佢知道佢

388
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
新人係從聖靈懷孕

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
而佢所懷嘅胎

390
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
就係呢個救世主嘅時候

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
佢不禁去讚美上帝

392
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
呢個係46節、49節

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
第二段就係講到

394
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
出世呢位耶穌基督

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
佢帶嚟嘅係一個徹頭徹底嘅革命

396
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
係耶穌基督嘅革命

397
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
係54至56節

398
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
50至53節

399
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
最後耶穌基督嘅救贖大功

400
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
係乜嘢人先可以得咗

401
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
就係54至55節

402
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
首先我哋睇睇第一段

403
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
46至49節

404
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
馬尼亞說:我心尊主為大

405
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
我寧以我的神救主為樂

406
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
因為他顧念他侍女的卑微

407
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
從今以後萬代要稱我有福

408
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
哪有權能的為我成就了大事

409
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
他的名

410
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
為聖

411
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
如果我哋要明白呢段聖經嘅背景

412
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
我可以做一個咁嘅比喻

413
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
我哋喺最最後一回嘅時候

414
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
突然間

415
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
美國政府派咗

416
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
一啲重要高級人

417
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
就嚟到我呢度

418
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
然後佢就宣佈

419
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
話我哋美國人發覺

420
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
呢個特朗普都唔係好適宜

421
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
做我哋美國總統

422
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
所以我哋決定呢

423
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
呢個幾個委員會

424
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
呢啲幾個Electors

425
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
決定呢

426
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
係搵Mr. Jason Wong

427
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
做我哋嘅

428
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
下一屆嘅美國總統

429
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
代替咗

430
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
呢一個特朗普

431
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Jason你

432
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
有咩感受

433
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
佢真係黑令頭

434
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
佢真係話

435
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
我唔得嘅

436
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
我無得

437
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
我無能

438
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
我無能

439
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
又唔係人民選出嚟,點得呀

440
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
個個心情

441
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
就係馬利亞嘅心情

442
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
當天使報信話

443
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
我報給你一個大起嘅信息

444
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
就係你要

445
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
懷孕生子

446
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
呢個係救世主

447
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
馬利亞就話我係咩人呀

448
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
我無得無能

449
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
我只不過個皮女

450
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
但係

451
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
既然一上帝要用我

452
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
係成就一個咁大嘅革命嘅時候

453
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
我唔單只

454
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
係恐懼裏面

455
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
戰經裏面

456
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
我存住感謝嘅心

457
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
願上帝嘅革命能夠成就

458
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
俾我有滿足嘅快樂

459
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
呢個就係咁嘅意思

460
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
所以喺

461
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
呢一段聖經裏面你睇到

462
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
馬利亞唱嘅時候

463
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
係好個人性嘅

464
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
佢唔係一啲公式化

465
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
佢唔係念台詞

466
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
係好個人性

467
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
好有感情

468
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
一開始嘅時候我心

469
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
尊主為大

470
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
尊主為大呢個字

471
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
嘩好犀利我心尊主為大

472
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
尊主為大

473
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
即係話

474
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Agaliso呢個希臘文嘅字

475
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
即係話呢

476
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
我極之開心尊崇你

477
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
係邊度

478
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
點樣尊崇你

479
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
係我嘅靈呀係我嘅心呀

480
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
係Suke希臘文個字

481
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
零係Numa

482
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
係人嘅心裏面

483
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
最深處嘅地方

484
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
係最最純真的地方

485
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
我係從我心底裏面

486
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
去發出我最喜樂嘅歡聲

487
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
話神下

488
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
我係何我係乜水呀

489
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
你幾年之間去

490
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
使用我你幾年之間

491
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
係成為咗你嘅工具

492
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
事實上都係

493
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
有時我諗下我自己

494
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
最近我

495
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
返香港

496
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
同我太太

497
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
同我女兒

498
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
同我孫

499
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
同埋一個外孫咁我哋一齊返香港

500
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
返香港主要原因呢

501
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
就係因為我畢業啦

502
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
我去咗優之後呢就返香港大學讀書

503
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
咁呀

504
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
畢業啦

505
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
咁問我

506
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
你有咩感受呀

507
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
全體當中呢

508
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
我係最大嘅一個

509
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
70歲先畢業

510
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
但我諗返下

511
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
我都唔知我自己點解可以畢到業

512
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
你問我

513
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
真係完全唔知道自己點解畢到業

514
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
喺我研究嘅過程裏面

515
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
有好多時候

516
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
揭手

517
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
突然之間

518
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
就有啲資料出嚟解答咗我問題

519
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
我哋讀歷史

520
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
有時需要啲口述歷史

521
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
口述歷史就係要訪問下

522
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
因為我讀中國近代史

523
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
咁最好係搵到

524
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
而家再生嗰啲人

525
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
我發夢都諗唔到

526
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
我竟然之間

527
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
可以搵到咁嘅人去畀我訪問

528
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
我走到去中國

529
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
訪問一個95歲嘅

530
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
老牧師

531
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
佢正正係我研究裏面其中一個

532
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
好重要嘅一環去話畀我聽

533
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
95歲仲清醒

534
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
而且呢

535
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
頭腦非常清醒

536
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
更加我自己搅頭

537
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
我講嗰啲普通話

538
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
佢可以聽得明

539
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
佢講嗰啲普通話我又聽得明

540
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
真係奇怪

541
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
唔能夠唔服曬上帝嘅安排

542
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
我訪問咗佢唔夠幾個月

543
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
佢就返咗天府到

544
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
遲幾個月都搞唔掂

545
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
就俾我

546
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
帶俾我一啲嘅突破

547
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
喺研究裏面一啲嘅突破

548
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
我諗返下

549
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
我係乜水

550
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
點解我能夠可以去侍服

551
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
我有乜水可以站喺呢個港台裏面

552
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
同大家分享

553
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
毫無所誇

554
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
唯一就好似

555
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
馬尼亞講我係乜嘢

556
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
我只不過係侍女

557
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
中文譯個侍女

558
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
亦都好大靚

559
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
侍女人哋覺得話

560
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
侍女好呀

561
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
希臘文個duly嗰字最好譯咗乜

562
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
妹仔嚟

563
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
我係妹仔嚟㗎

564
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
瀑皮嚟㗎

565
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
我係卑微嘅

566
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
一個咁卑微

567
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
一個咁樣人

568
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
上帝都可以用

569
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
我哋只能夠講一句說話話

570
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
上帝你得

571
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
保羅講得好啱

572
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
如果要誇誇我哋嘅軟弱

573
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
藉著我哋嘅弱神

574
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
一大能彰顯出嚟

575
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
所以

576
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
當密木師叫你侍奉

577
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
或者叫你侍奉

578
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
你唔好話我唔得㗎

579
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
就係你唔得所以先要侍奉

580
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
如果你覺得你自己得嘅時候

581
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
上帝唔會呀

582
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
卑微嘅就升高喎

583
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
高嘅就要降低

584
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
所以你睇到呢段聖經

585
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
係一個好重要嘅好個人性

586
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
仲有呀呢段聖經係成仙啟後

587
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
呢段聖經

588
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
同三號耳機上帝二章

589
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
哈拿嘅詩歌

590
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
係好相似

591
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
係上帝嘅恩典

592
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
叫馬尼亞可以抬住個托

593
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
而且你再嚟睇一睇馬尼亞嘅歌

594
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
裏面

595
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
好有趣嘅

596
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
你研讀呢段聖經嘅時候

597
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
你發覺嗆我個頭

598
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
四十六節

599
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
我心尊主為大

600
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
尊主嘅尊字呢

601
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
係用現代式嘅

602
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
即係希臘文化係現代式嘅

603
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
四十七節呢我寧以我啲教主為樂

604
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
係用過去式嘅

605
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
四十八節

606
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
塔庫涅斯女嘅卑微呢

607
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
係過去式嘅

608
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
然後四十八節從今以後萬代青鵝為有福

609
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
係將來式嘅future tense

610
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
如果我係老師

611
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
改呢篇文嘅時候

612
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
我又啞我個頭

613
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
喂你搞乜鬼㗎

614
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
得閒又用下過去式

615
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
又係用下現代式

616
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
用下將來式

617
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
全部都係講而家嘅嘢

618
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
點解你用到暖曬大龍

619
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
但係呢

620
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
如果我係咁批評呢

621
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
我就唔食嘢

622
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
原來係希臘文嘅文法入面

623
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
有一個文法叫做

624
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Ingressive Errors

625
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Ingressive Errors即係係過去式

626
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
但係個Ingressive Errors

627
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
係咩意思呢

628
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
係講一個好重要嘅事實

629
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
呢個字嘅意思即係話呢

630
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
佢開始咗之後

631
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
就會繼續去

632
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
英文可以咁講法

633
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I have begun to enter into the age of praise

634
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
係由呢度開始啟開一個新嘅時代

635
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
由呢度開始一個新嘅時代係唔同

636
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
原來耶穌基督降生係啟開一個新嘅時代

637
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
係完全唔同

638
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
呢首第一首聖詩

639
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
係話畀你聽

640
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
耶穌基督啟開一個新嘅時代

641
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
時間來了

642
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
呢個係咩時代

643
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
革命

644
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
跟住係第五十次至五十三次

645
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
耶穌基督講過三個革命

646
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
邊三個革命

647
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
第一個係叫道德嘅革命

648
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
第二個

649
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
係社會嘅革命

650
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
第三個

651
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
係經濟嘅革命

652
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
首先我哋睇睇

653
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
乜嘢叫做社會革命

654
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
他憐憫敬畏他的人

655
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
直到世世代代

656
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
他用傍備施展大能

657
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
打狂奧的正心裏妄想

658
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
就被他趕散了

659
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
他叫有權並力失衞

660
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
叫卑微的高聲

661
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
耶穌基督嚟到

662
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
係反轉整個世界

663
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
再高嘅

664
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
要講低

665
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
再低嘅要升高

666
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
或者你會問

667
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
邊度係呀

668
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
唔係呀你諗一諗

669
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
我係香港嚟

670
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
香港就有好多

671
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
嗰啲會

672
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
馬會

673
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
你加入啲會

674
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
個身份就唔動

675
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
我以為呢

676
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
我唔知

677
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
有朋友請我請你去

678
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
馬會食飯啦咁去馬會

679
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
我以為馬會呢就咁去馬會囉

680
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
我以為最多以

681
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
加入會費三十萬都好犀利

682
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
你知唔知而家加入馬會要幾錢

683
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
香港馬會

684
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
加入馬會

685
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
有無人知?有無人係馬會嘅會員

686
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
冇呀

687
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
有無你啲朋友係馬會嘅會員

688
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
你知唔知

689
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
加入馬會嘅會要幾錢

690
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
三百萬

691
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
仲要排長龍

692
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
咁我唔去馬會

693
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
我去其他會得唔得

694
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
有扶輪社

695
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
獅子會

696
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
咩咩

697
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
九龍堂會所

698
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
如果你香港嚟

699
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
就知到好多會所呢啲

700
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
九龍堂業主會所

701
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
每個會所都有

702
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
俱樂部

703
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
全部都係咩呀

704
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
要加入會費幾十萬

705
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
或者百幾萬

706
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
所以佢多數係

707
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
同等人士

708
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
我想問

709
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
去加入會費,使唔使加入會費

710
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
唔使喎

711
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
教會係一個好奇怪嘅地方

712
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
你諗下,真係好奇怪

713
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
尤其係你諗下

714
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
係耶穌基督嘅時代

715
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
個教會真係好奇怪

716
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
嗰陣時仲有奴隸制度

717
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
係奴隸

718
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
嗰奴隸係冇生死權

719
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
係畀個主人嘅,主人操縱晒

720
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
點解呢個奴隸有一日信左耶穌

721
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
去左教會

722
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
一路成長,做左主人學老師添

723
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
咁冇幾耐呢

724
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
佢個主人又信左耶穌

725
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
又去到教會

726
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
做左主人學嘅學生

727
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
喺屋企就係主人同埋奴隸

728
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
去到教會

729
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
就係老師同埋主學

730
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
喂,你冇背金句呀

731
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
你返去快啲要背金句啦

732
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
咁呢個主人,哈哈哈哈

733
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
返到去佢都唔敢砌

734
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
你會發覺佢將成個嘅

735
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
社會嘅秩序嘅規矩

736
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
調晒嚟,調亂晒啦

737
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
喺個教會裏面

738
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
可能好有錢

739
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
好有地位,好崇高地位嘅人

740
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
一個係好卑微

741
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
係奴隸嚟嘅

742
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
佢可以手揸手,稱叫

743
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
弟兄姊妹,一同嘅唱詩

744
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
你喺扶輪社搵唔到嘅

745
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
你喺馬會搵唔到嘅

746
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
你喺任何地方搵唔到嘅

747
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
喺教會你會搵到

748
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
就因為耶穌基督嘅革命

749
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
叫在位嘅要

750
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
降低,再低嘅

751
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
就要升高

752
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
稱為弟兄姊妹

753
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
好奇怪

754
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
我諗返我哋香港嘅教會

755
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
龍蛇混雜

756
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
但無論龍係好蛇

757
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
我喺上帝睇嚟都係全部係龍嚟

758
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
有啲係好叻嘅讀書

759
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
有啲係完全

760
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
唔...

761
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
即係小學

762
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
12年級不如嘅

763
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
有啲係好有錢嘅,有啲好窮

764
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
但係喺教會裏面

765
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
冇分呢啲嘢嘅

766
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
就好似保羅話

767
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
喺基督裏面無分自主

768
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
無分為勞嘅

769
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
我理得你係咩學位

770
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
我理得你係咩...你係...你係...你係...

771
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
你點樣篩理法,冇人知

772
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
我哋只係知道一樣嘢

773
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
專主為主

774
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
呢個咪就係聖經裏面

775
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
所講嘅革命

776
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
呢個就係耶穌都所講嘅

777
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
去施展

778
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
傍臂大能嘅

779
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
叫在上嘅要降低,大低嘅

780
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
升高,你睇下耶穌點樣講法

781
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
搵散,失慰,

782
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
升高,得飽未食,空手回血

783
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
全部呢啲字

784
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
都係話畀我哋聽

785
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
係耶穌基督嘅革命

786
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
帶嚟個結果

787
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
仲有呀,你再睇一睇

788
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
第52節,佢叫有權並嘅

789
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
失慰,叫卑賤嘅,升高

790
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
今日個世界最大嘅問題係咩

791
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
今日世界最大嘅問題

792
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
就係要

793
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
要有等位

794
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
我哋中國人

795
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
喺春秋戰國嘅時候

796
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
亂晒大陸,孔夫子就話

797
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
唔得,一定要

798
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
有等位

799
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
點樣有等位呀,就係五輪君臣

800
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
父子兄弟,夫婦朋友

801
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
你君要臣死

802
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
臣不死,視為不忠

803
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
父要子王,子不王,視為不孝

804
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
一定要咁樣嘅規矩

805
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
有order先有order

806
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
咁樣出嚟

807
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
但基督教唔講

808
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
一視同仁,個個都係

809
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
按照上帝嘅形象所做

810
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
但我哋仍然可以,喺耶穌基督嘅

811
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
領導之下

812
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
能夠平安夜

813
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
ok

814
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
53節更加話畀你聽

815
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
佢唔單止帶嚟個社會嘅革命

816
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
唔單止帶嚟道德嘅革命

817
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
佢更加帶嚟一個嘅經濟嘅革命

818
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
咁你要話嘅嘔口

819
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
咩叫經濟革命,就係53節

820
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
叫飢餓的得飽美食

821
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
叫富足的空手回嘅

822
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
你睇下今日呢個世界

823
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
今日呢個世界

824
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
唔係唔夠食物

825
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
而係食物分唔勻

826
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
唔係唔夠資源

827
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
而係資源分唔勻

828
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
有錢嘅就好有錢

829
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
窮嘅就好窮

830
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
如果我哋將今日整個世界

831
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
分為成為一個100人嘅村落

832
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
100人當中有33個

833
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
係叫做有錢嘅

834
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
有錢嘅就有錢

835
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
有錢嘅就有錢

836
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
當中有33個係叫做有錢嘅

837
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
67個係窮嘅

838
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
窮到一日一餐都未必得嘅

839
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
窮到一日一餐都未必得嘅

840
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
個33個有錢

841
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
係佔全條村90%嘅財產

842
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
全條村90%嘅財產

843
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
90%嘅食物

844
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
其中

845
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
呢33個有7個係特別有錢

846
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
佢哋扔落去

847
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
垃圾桶嘅食物

848
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
足可以養活咗

849
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
66%嗰啲窮人

850
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
佢哋擁有嘅財產

851
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
係佔整個世界

852
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
裏面一個好大嘅比率

853
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
中國人所謂

854
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
不患寡而患不均

855
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
杜夫講一首詩句裏面

856
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
我諗好真

857
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
今日嘅情況

858
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
朱梅

859
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
酒肉臭

860
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
路友凍死骨

861
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
有啲又好

862
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
有錢食到嘅嘢

863
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
都臭曬

864
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
有啲窮到

865
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
冇飯食餓食

866
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
今日我哋嘅世界就係咁樣

867
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
但聖經話畀你聽

868
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
如果

869
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
我哋有耶穌基督嘅心喺裏面

870
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
連率嘅心

871
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
我哋可唔可以

872
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
能夠

873
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
容忍一個咁樣嘅情況

874
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
我諗返我自己

875
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
1950年代

876
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
我係香港長大

877
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
我讀二年級嘅時候

878
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
我記得一件事

879
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
我而家印象到好深刻

880
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
就我阿爸帶我出街食飯

881
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
好少出街食飯

882
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
個次特別例外唔知係佢生日咗咩帶我出街食飯

883
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
食一盒飯嘅時候

884
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
我就見咗個餐館裏面

885
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
其實我食飯係大排檔

886
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
又見到有一個男人

887
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
四十幾歲帶住三個細路

888
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
兩個女一個仔

889
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
都係好細過

890
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
帶到入去個餐館

891
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
嗰度

892
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
然後就唱一首

893
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
埋唱唱一首歌

894
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
然後就喺周圍每一排裏面

895
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
唔係黑錢

896
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
你食剩嗰啲嘢

897
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
可唔可以嚟畀我哋食

898
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
50年初期嘅香港

899
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
好貧窮

900
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
跟住我爸爸就同我講一句說話

901
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
你知唔知道

902
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
我哋每日都有飯食

903
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
唔使走嚟到黑

904
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
係咩原故

905
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
我話唔知

906
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
我爸爸就同我講

907
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
我係孤兒院做

908
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
個孤兒院係美國人

909
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
都係個西教士

910
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
香港開設嘅一個孤兒院

911
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
我哋每日食嘅

912
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
係佢啲基督徒

913
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
愛心奉獻出嚟嘅麵

914
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
麵粉

915
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
大米

916
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
可以喺呢個孤兒院裏面長大

917
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
呢個就叫分量

918
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
基督教好強調一樣

919
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
施比受更為有福

920
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
今日我哋有冇諗過

921
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
耶穌基督所畀我哋

922
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
你見到一個人

923
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
冇飯食你畀飯去食

924
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
你見到人冇衫著畀衫去著

925
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
當來將來見面嘅時候

926
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
耶穌就話

927
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
我坐監嘅時候你嚟探我

928
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
我飢餓嘅時候你嚟畀我食

929
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
我冇衫著嘅時候你畀衫我著

930
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
呢個二人話

931
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
耶穌冇下我冇做過我冇見過你

932
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
耶穌話你做喺個小子身上

933
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
即係做喺我身上

934
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
聖誕節係一個分享

935
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
我哋諗過今日喺世界裏面仲有好多人

936
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
係一個嘅

937
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
仍然係一個掙扎裏

938
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
美國可能好富庶

939
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
係迷人

940
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
貧富好懸殊嘅地方

941
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
今日係唐人埠裏面

942
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
有幾多人係新移民裏面

943
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
仲有好大嘅掙扎

944
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
係幾多個老人家

945
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
係個單房裏面仍然係個

946
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
係個管間房裏面

947
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
好多嘅掙扎

948
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
好孤單

949
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
有邊個去理會

950
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
邊個會體諒

951
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
有邊個去諗一諗

952
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
今日我哋需要將耶穌基督呢一個革命

953
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
帶俾周圍嘅人

954
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
第54至56節

955
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
聖經就話俾你聽

956
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
係有一種人

957
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
呢種係乜嘢

958
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
就係

959
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
他輔助他的僕人以色列

960
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
為要紀念阿伯諾哈摩他的後裔

961
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
乜嘢人先可以嘗到呢個革命

962
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
只有一種人

963
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
就係以色列人

964
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
但以色列人唔係血統嘅以色列人

965
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
係屬靈嘅以色列人

966
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
就係憑著相信耶穌基督

967
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
接受耶穌

968
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
喺我哋生命裏面嘅

969
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
呢個叫真以色列人

970
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
今日你會否常愛耶穌基督

971
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
呢個比我哋大嘅喜樂

972
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
我會否常愛耶穌基督嘅救恩

973
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
今日仲有好多人

974
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
喺救恩嘅門口

975
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
我哋冇諗過將呢個福音帶俾佢哋

976
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
求主憐憫我哋

977
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
將佢心低頭去同佢哋佈局

978
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
天父我哋再一次多謝你

979
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
俾你報告

980
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
我哋會再次多謝你

981
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
多謝你

982
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
天父我哋再一次多謝你

983
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
俾你寶貴嘅話語去提醒我哋

984
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
俾我哋明白聖誕嘅真意

985
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
我哋多謝你

986
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
我哋紀念到五堂嘅時候

987
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
有報道會

988
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
求你藉由呢個報道會

989
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
叫咗啲未信嘅朋友都有機會認識你

990
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
你祝福引領我哋

991
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
多謝你,祈禱奉耶穌基督名求

992
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
阿門
