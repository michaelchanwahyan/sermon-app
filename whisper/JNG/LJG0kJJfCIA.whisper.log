[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   A while ago, a colleague, who is actually half my boss, retired.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   He gave me a book titled "It is OK to be Average".
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   It means, "It's OK to be average".
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   If your boss gave you a book like this, what would you think?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   At first, I was wondering why there was a book like this.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Because in university, you are usually told to be outstanding, to be number one, to get a certain award.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   But why did he give me a book titled "It is OK to be Average"?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Does that mean I am really average?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I opened the book and found it quite interesting.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   It was written by an old Chinese from Singapore,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   telling his life experience.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   He told a story that we are all familiar with,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   a story about a ugly duckling.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Do you remember the story about the ugly duckling?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Maybe some of you who are older would have heard of it.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   He said that there was a small duckling,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   black, very ugly.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   After it was born, its parents went missing.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Then, it was very sad to see a group of white ducklings.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Its mother took the ducklings with her and walked along.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It followed the ducklings, hoping to find a mate.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But it was ugly, so it was always laughed at.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   "Why are you so ugly? Everyone else is white, but you are black and ugly."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   It was very sad and cried, and complained,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   "Why am I so ugly?"
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Finally, as it grew up, it realized that it was a swan.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It was more beautiful than the other ducks,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and it could fly higher than them.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It was a beautiful black swan,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   although it was a black swan.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   We are most afraid of white swans,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   but we were afraid of black swans.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   This story is very simple.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It tells us that sometimes we feel that we are worse than others.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We feel that we are not very special,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   or that we do not have special talents,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   or that we are not better than others.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But how does God see us?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Or what kind of people does God want to use?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Are all the people He wants to use smart and capable?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Do they all have a lot of degrees, books, and talents?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Do they all have power and money?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I remember the first chapter of the Bible in the Old Testament.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It says, "Have you ever thought that among you people who are in the dream,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   there are not many people who are wise,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   who have a good eye for the flesh?"
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It means that you are not particularly smart.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   How many disciples have received the Bell of the Lord?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I don't think there are many.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It says, "There are not many people who are wise,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   who have power,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   who have money,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and who are not very noble."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But God chose these people to serve Him.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   This is the topic I will talk about today.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   It is okay to be an ordinary Christian.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It may not be a bad thing to be an ordinary Christian.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   The Bible reminds us that God does not have to choose the best,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   or at least in the eyes of man,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   He can choose the best,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   the one with the most talents, the one with the most degrees,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   or the one who was born into a very dark family.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   God does not have to choose such people to serve Him.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Instead, He chose ordinary people.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   What for?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Here, He says a very special reason.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   He says, "So that you will not boast,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   that because I am very good,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I can do these things for God.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You cannot boast that because I am very good,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I have read a lot of books,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   so I have such achievements,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I can be a leader."
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Let's look at some examples in the Bible.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Before talking about the examples,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   how do we define what is "ordinary"?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What is "not outstanding"?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Maybe in our eyes, ordinary people are those who are not famous,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   who do not have much degrees,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   who do not have many English letters in their names.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Many people have written a lot of things,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   from middle school to university,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and they have written a lot of English letters.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   The more letters they have, the better they are.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   God does not think these things are important.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   He says, "In God's perspective,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   availability matters more than ability."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Does that mean you are really prepared to be used?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Availability, is it that you can respond at any time,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and respond at any time,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   is more important than your ability?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Availability is more important than ability.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I want to share with you a few simple,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   very obvious examples.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   When Moses was called by God on Mount Sinai,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   to lead hundreds of thousands of Israelites out of Egypt,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   what was Moses' first reaction?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   He said, "God, have you ever thought that
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I am actually a very talkative person?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I am even a bit of a talker.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   How can I have the ability to convince Pharaoh
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   to release hundreds of thousands of Israelites?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   How can I use my ability to convince those people
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   to follow me into the desert,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   so that they may not be able to eat,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   live a good life,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   or even die in the wilderness?"
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   God said, "Actually, I don't need you to be very talkative.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   What do you have?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   You have the crutch in your hand.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   This is what I am giving you.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You can use this crutch
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   to carry the words I am giving you."
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Then you can do it.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   in the next 40 years.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   He was not a very good person.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   He was like the Egyptian prince in his cartoons.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   He was very handsome and good at fighting.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   But he was not a politician.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   He was not a very talkative person either.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   The second example is David.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   You may have seen this statue in Italy.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   He was very handsome with a little curly hair.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   He was very big.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   He was a boy.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   He was holding a rope in his hand.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   The rope was wrapped around a stone ball.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It was said that David used a small stone
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   to defeat Goliath.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But when he was about to go to war,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   he said to himself,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   "When I go to war with the Phoenicians,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   people will laugh at me.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Even his father will laugh at him.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   What's wrong with you?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   You are not a soldier.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   You don't know how to fight.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   You are so small.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   You are not a person who can fight with a giant.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Even his father thought,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   "You are just a little boy.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   How can you go to war?"
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He didn't think he was so talented.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   As a result, he defeated a giant with a small stone.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Of course, there are many explanations
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   as to why a giant was defeated by a small stone.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   There is a very strange explanation in medicine.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   If you haven't heard it, I'll tell you now.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   In medicine, there is a symptom called "Giant Syndrome".
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It is caused by a huge amount of hormones
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   in the lower brain.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   The people there are very big.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Although they are very big,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   they can't fight.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Because their muscles are actually broken.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   They are not really strong.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   They can't fight.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   In addition, there is a thing in the lower brain.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   They look at things in a dreamy way.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   They see two shadows.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So when they see a small stone flying over,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   they can't avoid it.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   They can't avoid it.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   They can't avoid it.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   They can't avoid it.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   This is a joke in medicine.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   No matter what,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   God used a child who was very blind.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   A boy with a wooden sheep.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   He used a very blind weapon
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   to defeat a giant of Phileas.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   This is not the most capable and wisest choice in the world.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   No.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It is a choice that everyone thinks is impossible.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   What is closer is that
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Jesus' mother, Maria,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   was a person who,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   when the angel told her,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   "You will be pregnant
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and become the mother of the Savior."
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   She asked, "Who am I?"
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   "I am just a woman, a woman."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   "I just cook at home."
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   "I don't know how to do anything."
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   "I am just a housewife."
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Today, many of our sisters may say,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   "I just cook. I just take care of the kids."
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   "How can I do such a great thing?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   God chose a woman who had no degree
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   to become Jesus' mother.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   What is her greatest advantage?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   She said, "If you choose me,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I am willing to do this."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   She was accepting,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   convincing, and willing.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   God made her
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   a baby girl
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   who was born from her own womb.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Isn't this a wonderful choice?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   But I think another wonderful thing is
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Jesus himself with the twelve disciples.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   None of them
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   looked very good in the eyes of people,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   especially those with talent.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yes, there was a "tax collector".
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   He was not well-liked by people.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Others were fishermen,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   farmers,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and even those who were protesting
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   in the streets of the opposition parties.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Jesus chose such people
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   as his disciples.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   None of them had a degree,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   not a Ph.D.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Although Paul was the most wise
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and learned man,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   he was a Roman.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   He read a lot of Roman philosophy and law.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   But he was the one
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   who wrote the Bible.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   God chose those
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   who were not particularly wise.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   So all these examples
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   show that God did not choose
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   the best among the people in the Bible.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Of course, there are some who are not the same.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   For example, Daniel was a handsome and smart man.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   This is a little different.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Or even as I said,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Paul was a very learned man.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   But most of them were not chosen
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   because they were not wise,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   not of a high status,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   not of special ability.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   They were chosen to be
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   the ones who thought they were smart.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   He chose the wise people
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   to be the ones who were wise.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   He chose the weak people
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   to be the ones who were strong.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   When I did not do well in my previous exams,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I liked to watch this Bible.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I told the first one,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   "You are not very good.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   God chose me.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Maybe you are not very good."
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Are we satisfied today
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   with our lack of wisdom and ability?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And then we continue to make
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   an ordinary faith.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And then every week,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   we sing a few songs,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   and then we eat a few things.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And then we go back to our normal life.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   We are very happy.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   We are an ordinary believer.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Is this our life?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Well, I believe God
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   in the examples we saw just now,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   showed us one thing.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   You can be a very ordinary person.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   But God can turn you
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   into an extraordinary leader.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   He can make you
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   an extraordinary believer.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   As long as you wait until that day,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   and you are ready to wait
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   until that day comes,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   how can we go from being ordinary
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   to being extraordinary?
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   How can we be used by God?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Today, because I don't have enough time,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   there are many lights here
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   in English.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   But the Bible,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   as the brother just translated it for me,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   is in Chinese.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   It's really good.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   There are seven things
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   you can prepare
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   to make your ordinary
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   become extraordinary
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   in God.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   First,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   you have to dedicate your heart to God.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   The Bible says we should
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   devote our heart, our mind, and our spirit
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   to God who loves you.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   You have to love Him.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You have to dedicate your heart to Him.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I am willing to do so.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Just like a lover,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   a wife and a husband,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I am willing to do whatever you ask me to do.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I will devote my heart, my spirit, and my spirit
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   to love Him.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And every day, through our reading the Bible,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   our prayer,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   it's like talking to your lover.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Such a close relationship.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   One day,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   God will show us.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   After this relationship,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   you will be like
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   a prophet.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   When he sees an image,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   God finally appears before him.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The highest Jehovah
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   sits high on the temple.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   His clothes are under the bed.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   The temple is covered with angels and salafis
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   singing,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   "Glory, glory, glory to the Jehovah of the angels."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   When he sees such an image,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   he was a normal person.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   God suddenly said,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   "Who can I show my love to?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Who is willing to go for me?"
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   He immediately said,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   "I am here. Please show me your love."
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   He was ready.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   He was willing to make himself available.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   He was willing to show himself.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   This is a very important...
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   But you must have a close relationship with God
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   before you say this.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   "I am willing to do this for you.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Please show me your love."
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Not everyone can say that.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It must be someone you love very much.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Your wife.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   You love her very much.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   What does she ask you to do?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   You say, "I am willing. Please show me your love."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   How many husbands say,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   "You and your wife ask me to show you my love."
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   "You ask me to go shopping."
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   "You ask me to show you my love."
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   "You ask me to take my children to this and that."
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   "You ask me to show you my love."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   We rarely say that.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   But if you really love that person,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   you are willing to do what you are willing to
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   for him, for your wife, for your children.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Besides these two things,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   the third thing is to pay attention to...
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Even if you don't have any special skills,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   you should look at what you have in your hands
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   that can be used by God.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   It's like Moses.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   He didn't have anything. He only had a stick.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   He had a spear.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But that spear was very powerful.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It could turn into a snake.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   The snake could turn into a spear.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And when it hit the water,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   it could separate the sea.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   The Red Sea was split in half
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   and let people cross it.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   The things in his hands were not very special.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   But they were all tools.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   David's spear was smaller.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   It had a stone and a rope.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   But that was also something that could be used by God.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   As long as he is willing to use you,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   you are willing to follow.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Today, some of us have a group of sisters
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   who sang very well.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   But you may say, "I don't have that voice."
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   "I can hear someone singing very well."
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   "Our voices are very different."
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   No. You are willing to use your voice.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Or you are willing to use your words.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   You may speak a few languages.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Then you may be used by God.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   The Chaozhou dialect, Hakka dialect,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   and Cantonese,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   you may be used by God.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Do you know what's in your hands?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   It may not be a very powerful weapon.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But when God wants to use you,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   it becomes something that can be used.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   The Bible says, "Those who are faithful in small things
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   will be faithful in great things."
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Jesus said, "When I chose people,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I chose those who were faithful in small things."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   When you cook, are you faithful?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   When you buy food, are you not being discouraged?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   When I was a doctor,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I thought, "I have seen such a normal disease."
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I have seen a patient in such a small clinic.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   But are you faithful in small things?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   If so, God may put you in a big thing one day
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   to show His ability to do great things.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   So in our small things every day,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   we must be faithful,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   and be faithful to God.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Sometimes God will transform you,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   prepare you,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   so that you are more suitable for great things.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   These kinds of training are usually done
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   when you are most unhappy.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   I will tell you an example later.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   After I was a doctor for three years,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   I decided to leave my position
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   and go to Canada to do a doctorate.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   But I was not selected or recruited to Harvard
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   to be a Canadian.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I went to a place called Calgary,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   where I did a PhD.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I asked myself,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   "What did I do wrong?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Why was I selected to be trained
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   in such a small and unpopular place?"
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   In such a small place,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I trained myself how to live independently,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   how to think independently,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   and not necessarily follow the boss' instructions.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I trained myself to live in a cold,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and unpopular environment.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Often, when we think that life is a low,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and encountering a lot of difficulties,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   God is preparing you,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   preparing you to do something big.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   God is preparing you to live a life
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   where you can be a living testimony.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   God did not choose us because we have a shirt,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   but because our daily life is like a document
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   that proves that we are loyal to Him.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Although it is a small thing,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   we are loyal to Him.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   The gentleman behind me is very good.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Every time I turn around,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   the screen will turn to show me
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   what I wrote.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Thank you.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Lastly,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   the seventh thing to note and prepare is
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   that you must still have a humble heart.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   A humble heart.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   It is a very easy mistake.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   When you have a little bit of success,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   you will think, "I can do it."
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   When you reach the first level,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   you will realize that you are not bad.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   But this is the time when we fall easily
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   because we lack humility.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Lack of humility is because we know
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   that we can stand still today
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   because we are like a grapevine
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   that is tied to a branch.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Jesus said that if the grapevine is not tied to the tree,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   you will not be able to bear fruit.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   You will not be able to continue to play your role.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   So be humble and...
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   I must not turn my face to you.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Be humble and dependent.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   He said that you must rely on Him
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and be humble.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   The seven things...
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You don't remember which seven things I mentioned.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Usually, we only mention two things.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   What is the first thing?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   The first thing is that you must love Him
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   with all your heart and all your mind.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Then you must be willing to be called.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Like Isaiah,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   "Lord, I am in this place. Please show me."
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Then you must see what you have
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   and what you can use.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Then you must be loyal in small things.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   When you are in trouble,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   you must accept His training and His teaching.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Finally, you must use your daily life
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   as a witness
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   and become your true friend.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Finally, when you have a little bit of success,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   you must continue to be humble
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and depend on Him.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   You must be humble.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   This is what I think.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   How can you make your ordinary life
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   become extraordinary?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Today, I want to share with you
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   a photo that I haven't shown to anyone for a long time.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   This is me.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   I grew up in an ordinary family.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   The one sitting in the middle is me.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   The one holding me is my younger brother
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and my cousin.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Our family is not a rich family.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   It is definitely not a rich family.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   My grandfather was a car repairman.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   He was a sprayer.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   He opened a small workshop in Wanchai, Hong Kong.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   My mother was a small employee in a bank.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   It is strange that she worked in a big bank.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   There is a big bank in Hong Kong, UOB.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   She was a small employee.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   She only studied until she graduated from primary school.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   My father was a shopkeeper
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   who sold glasses.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   He was a very unremarkable person.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I still remember when I was young,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   I lived in Wanchai.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I could smell the smell of car spray.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   In Wanchai, Lohkak,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   there were many bars.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   The US military kept going to Vietnam to fight.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   After 6 weeks of fighting,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   he would come to Hong Kong and drink a big glass of wine in Wanchai.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Then he would go to the bar.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   You can imagine what he did.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I grew up in this kind of red-light district.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I think I am not particularly good-looking.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Although I am a little good-looking,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I am not particularly good-looking.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I am not particularly smart.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   I am really good at studying.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   I remember when I was in middle school,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I took the first exam.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I got 31 points out of 40 students.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Although I didn't get to the end,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I was already very close.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   But when I went from the first grade to the seventh grade,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I was the second or third in the class.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I was slowly rising.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   I am not a very good athlete.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I have never won a gold medal.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   You can see in this photo,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I am playing badminton with a friend.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   You can see that he is not good at playing badminton.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I am not a very talented person.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   At least in the eyes of a Westerner,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I am not a very talented person.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   When I became a doctor,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I was learning how to help people take their position.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   In the past, you had to look down like this.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   You had to look at a micro-lens to see what was in the position.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   It was very difficult.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   But the problem was that my boss didn't like me.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   He didn't like me because he thought my life was too smooth.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   He said that I passed the exam right away.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Everything seemed to be going well,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   but I had to give you some difficulties.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   So when I was training,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I was doing my gastroenterology,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   I was very unhappy and difficult.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   I had to resign my job and go to Canada to do my PhD.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   So in the three years in Canada,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I kept asking myself if I had made the wrong decision.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   I didn't want a doctor's job.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I went to Canada to be a student.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   The salary I got was less than a third of what I got as a doctor.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   It was a cold place.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   It was a very difficult environment for me to grow up.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   The worst thing was that when I got my PhD,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   it was 1992,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   when Canada was just entering the country's economic downturn.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   I wrote ten letters to ten different universities and hospitals in Canada.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   None of them replied to me,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   saying that they could hire me to continue working there.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   I thought, "Oh no, I'm graduating and I'm unemployed.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I can't go back to work in the hospital."
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   At that moment, Hong Kong called me and said,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   "Your boss has left.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Do you still want to come back to work?"
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   That's how I came back to Hong Kong in 1992.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I was working at a Chinese university.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I thought I would be working there for a year or two,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   because I thought I wouldn't stay in Hong Kong for long.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   But I worked there for 35 years.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   It was a completely unexpected arrangement.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   As I worked there, things started to improve.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I started to see some achievements.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   The articles we published were viewed by more people.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I trained more dentists and became a team.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Ten years later, in 2003,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   a big change occurred.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Everyone remembers SARS.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   It was a completely unprepared environment.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   When we thought we had some achievements,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   God gave us a surprise.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   It turned out that what we knew was very limited.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   We thought we had a lot of medical skills and experience.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But when a new virus appeared,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   we were completely at a loss.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   I remember telling myself and the reporters,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   "I feel like I'm carrying 100 eggs in my heart.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I can't let it fall to the ground."
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Each egg is a patient of mine.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   25% of the patients are doctors and nurses.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I don't want to see any life
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   because we don't know how to deal with it.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   So we lost these precious lives.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   At that moment, we prayed together and told God,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   "Please don't let my ignorance
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   make us abandon a life,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   a precious life."
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   At that moment, the whole room,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   the whole room of my office was filled with Christians.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Because we really had a lot of difficulties in our hearts.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   We didn't know how to solve them.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   But when we felt we were the most incompetent,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   when we felt we lacked wisdom,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   when we were the weakest,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   God showed His strength.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   A miracle happened.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   We started to pray for each patient in the ward every day.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Then we started to see the restoration.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Then there was the story of Sars.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   You may have heard of it.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   In this transition,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   people thought, "You can be a leader.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Why don't you do more leadership work?"
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   In 2008, when Sichuan had a big earthquake,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   I took a group of classmates to Wenchuan,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   the place where the earthquake was the most severe.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   We went to the town.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   You can see the bell is broken.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Many buildings have collapsed.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   The buildings next to us were originally three-story buildings,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   but now they are on the ground.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   At that time, I started to feel
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   that what I could do
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   or what God wanted me to do
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   was more than sitting in the office or in the door of the clinic to see the earthquake.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I can lead a group of students
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   to make them more useful people in society.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I thought, although I was much older than them,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   I was actually at the same age as their father,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   but they didn't seem to give up on me and their generation.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   They became my good friends.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   So I became a principal.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   It was a big surprise to become a principal.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I had never studied education.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   I only studied medicine.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I had never studied leadership or politics.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   But I was completely surprised to become a principal.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   In this surprise, I found that I had to face many problems every day.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I never imagined how to face them.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Although everyone was very happy at the graduation ceremony,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   the graduation ceremony of our university was the most terrifying day of the year.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Because there were protests and demonstrations that day.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Many reporters came to film our embarrassing scenes
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   and asked me some embarrassing questions.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   So every year, November is my biggest worry.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   I didn't know what would happen that day.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   I didn't know what kind of surprises would happen that day.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I just passed by the principal's office for seven and a half years.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I don't know why I came to this place.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   The story I just told you
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   is to show that I am a very honest person.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   I am a very ordinary person.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I am an ordinary person.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   But just like you,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   our ordinary can become God's extraordinary.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Our weak can become God's manifestation of His ability.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Our ignorant can become God's wisdom.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Sister Ling, have you ever thought that
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   even if you are very ordinary,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   as long as God is by your side,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   as long as He is holding you in His hands,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   one day you may do something great.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Or even in the eyes of others,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   it may not seem like a big deal.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   But in His eyes, it seems like a big deal.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   So today's Bible reminds us again
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   not to underestimate our own judgment.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   He says, if God wants to choose,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   He will choose those who are humble,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   those who are ungrateful.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   This is in Acts 4, verse 6.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   He says He will resist those who are arrogant,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   but will be kind to those who are humble.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Then He says in Columbus' 12th chapter,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   9th chapter,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   "My grace is sufficient for you;
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   my power is more perfect in the body of the weak."
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   It is not about how much power we have.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   It is not about our ability that counts.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   It is about our availability.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   We are willing to be used by God.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   It is like the saying,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   "Lord, I am here, please show me."
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Do you have this kind of mind today?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Do not underestimate yourself as a housewife.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Do not underestimate yourself as a...
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   I am about to retire. I am in my teens.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   I don't seem to have done anything great.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Do not underestimate your own ability.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Because in God's eyes, it is okay to be average.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   He can make your average life
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   become a very un-average life.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Let us bow our heads and pray.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Because our life is actually under your control,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   within your plan.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   We thank you because you allow us to enjoy
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   the growth and acceptance of your love.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Although we are not many in ability,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   not many in wisdom,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   you have chosen the weak in this world,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   called the wise, to be taken in.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   You have also chosen the weak in this world,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   called the strong to be taken in.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   You have chosen us because we are humble.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   We are one and the same.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Until when you do great things,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   we cannot overestimate ourselves.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   What we overestimate is your ability.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   We ask you to use each one of us well.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   We are willing to cook like cooking vegetables.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   I am here. Please show me.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Listen to our prayer.
