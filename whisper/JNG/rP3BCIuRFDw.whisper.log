[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Hello everyone, in my office I wrote a poem, a famous opening of "Three Kingdoms"
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   The first sentence is "The long river is boiling, the east is a small stream, the waves are flowing, the hero is running, is it a success or a failure, the green hill is still there, the few roads are straight and the sun is red"
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Then I wrote "The old man is white as a morning dew, the tree is still there" I want to share with you today is that in our life, we have walked a life of road, do you think you are a successful person or a failure?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   This does not necessarily mean doing academic, business, or government work. It may also mean that you are a housewife, a mother, or even a housekeeper.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   But how do we view our success and failure in the Bible?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   The Bible that our host just read gave me a very special view.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It seems that the definition of success and failure in the Bible is very different from ours.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I want to show you a picture. Do you think these two people are successful or failed?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I think we are watching the news every day, what are they doing, what are they saying?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   One is the most powerful person in the world. As the President of the United States, he signed an executive decision to immediately increase tariffs or do some amazing things.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   The other is the richest person in the world. Although he is only 50 years old, he owns the largest electric car company in the world, a rocket and AI company.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The most powerful person told the richest person, "Come and help me, help me clean up the door of our government, fire these useless people, and I will give you more money.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Because I will put the money saved by the government into sending people to Mars." Do you remember his opening speech?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   "We need to put more money into AI and other businesses." The richest person told the most powerful person, "You put me in an important position in the government,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   let me cut down some cotton, put some rainwater, so that I can make you more powerful, more able to control the world.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   You go here to collect taxes, go there to cut budget, so you can become a more powerful person.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Money and power are often what we pursue. These two things cannot be separated.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I believe many people will think of many examples. When you have money, you will have power more easily.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   When you have power, you will have more money. But is the success described in the Bible enough to have these two things?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   In history, there is a person who is rich and very powerful. I even think he is the most successful person in human history.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   He conquered the world at the age of 30. This person is Alexander the Great.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Many students have read his story when they were in school.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   He conquered Europe from Europe to Asia to India at the age of 30. If he had not died, if he had not died early,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   he might have really ruled the world. Because he has already crossed the border of Eurasia.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He is a very knowledgeable person. His teacher is Aristotle, a very famous philosopher.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   He received very good education. He is not only knowledgeable, but also a poet.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He can write poetry. I just found out.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And what he did has been passed down for many generations. It is hard to compare with him.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I just said that he has never lost a battle on the battlefield.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   In so many battles, from the beginning to the Persian, Egyptian, Middle Eastern and other countries,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   to India, he has never lost.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   There were 20 cities in the world called Alexander.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The most famous city in Egypt at that time was not Cairo, but Alexander.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   One of the seven wonders of the world is the lighthouse on the city of Alexander.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It was built because of him.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   The army led by him never left. And he is a person who knows how to use today's saying to show his image.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   He knows how to make his image look good.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   When people around him see him, they worship him very much.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   In the end, no one knows how he died.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   But there are some legends that he drank too much and died after a few days of drinking.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So, gastroenterology is a very important subject.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   So I chose this subject to do.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   He died after drinking.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   There is no way to prove that this is not true in his legend.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   When he died at the age of 32, he was only in his thirties.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   He was buried in a golden coffin.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   There were two holes in the coffin.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   He was asked to take his hands out of the two holes.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   When he was buried, he was seen by the whole world.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   He was seen by the whole world.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   This is how Alexander the Great was described in history.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Do you think he was a successful person or a failure?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The Bible we just read tells us how the Bible defines a person as successful or failure.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Look at the Chinese. I will read an English translation for you.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   He said, "Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   it remains only a single seed."
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   He said, "It is only a seed, but if it dies, it produces many seeds."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   If it is broken down, it becomes many seeds.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   This is what we read in the Bible.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   You may wonder how a seed dies.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Jesus continues to explain how a seed falls to the ground and dies.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   He said, "Anyone who loves their life will lose it."
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Anyone who loves their life and wants to pass on all the best things to others will lose their life.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   "While anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life."
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Those people will be able to obtain eternal life.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   He said, "Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, the servant will also be.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   My Father will honor the one who serves me."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Whoever follows me will follow me.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Wherever I go, you will go.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   My Father honors you.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   This is a successful life.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Because my Father, God, honors you.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   This is a successful example in the Bible.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   When did Jesus say this?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It is very interesting and special.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   When I was reading John's book,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I found that John's book is completely different from the previous three books.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   John's book is like the three books John read before,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   which contain the gaps in the middle.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   He found them very important.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   John rarely talks about one thing at a time,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   but he recorded many of Jesus' words.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Although this is in John's book 12,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   it is actually the last chapter of Jesus' 33 years on earth.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   At that time, many people already knew Jesus.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Many people were excited to hear him speak.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Many people followed him.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Until that day, he walked into Jerusalem on a donkey.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   This represents the people's greatest respect for him.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   For example, today, a king or a prime minister came to Singapore
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and received him with a red carpet.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   At that time, there was no red carpet,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   so he laid a lotus plant on the ground.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   He didn't even have a good horse,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   so he gave him a donkey to ride.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   But it also represents the people at that time,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   the people of the Gentiles,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   their future expectations and expectations.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   He thought this was their future Savior.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   So Jesus entered Jerusalem as a successful man.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Before he entered, he said the words I just said.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   But have you ever thought that
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   at that moment, he was successful,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   but soon he would flip to the most unsuccessful moment.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   In the eyes of people, it was the most unsuccessful moment.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Because after he entered Jerusalem,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   he could not come out again.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   After he entered,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   it was his last meal,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   his last supper.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Then he was arrested and charged with death on the cross.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   When I look back at this Bible,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I find that the success and failure of our life,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   or the so-called success and failure in the eyes of ordinary people,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   are actually very different from the definition of the Bible or God.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Secondly, if you think you are successful today,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   maybe in a moment,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   you will become the most unsuccessful person in the world.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   You see this president today, he looks like a boss.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   We don't know if he will really be like this all the time.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   At least in the eyes of people, it is considered successful.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   But it may change overnight.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   When we were studying,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   we always read the words of King Eugene II.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   From the perspective of people,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   King Eugene II said, "Success is not final."
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Success is not eternal, not the last.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Failure is not fatal.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It is the courage to continue that counts.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It is the courage to continue that counts.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   This is a saying that many people like.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   In the eyes of people,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   success and failure are always there.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Success and failure are always there.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   The most important thing is that you have the courage to continue working hard.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Then you will succeed.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   This is Winston Churchill's wise saying.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   But the Bible doesn't seem to say that.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   The Bible says that if you want to be successful,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   you have to die.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   You have to die like a piece of ink on the ground.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I want to talk about the story I always tell.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It was 20 years ago.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   There was SARS in Hong Kong and Singapore.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   At that moment,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   I experienced the most successful and most unsuccessful
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   at the same time.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Why do I say it was successful?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Because when this unknowingly contagious disease
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   came to Hong Kong and Singapore,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   no one knew what it was.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   But the doctors in our team
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   were the first to describe in detail
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   what SARS was.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   We published a very important article.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   To this day, it is the most quoted article in all my articles.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Because no one knew what it was.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Not only that,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   we also discovered what the virus was.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   The black dots in the middle
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   are the virus of the coronavirus.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   We also discovered what the virus was
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   and where it came from.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   So, in terms of science,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   it was a success.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   We published a very important article.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   We also made a lot of money.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I really use this word with others.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   We made a lot of money this time
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   for the support and generosity of the citizens.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   At that moment, the medical staff
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   seemed to have enjoyed a disaster.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   But they brought us some
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   unexpected results.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   But it was also a failure.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Looking back,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   it was a failure.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Because in the end,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   we couldn't find a drug
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   that could kill the virus like antibiotics.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   We couldn't even successfully
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   lock it in a certain area.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   This photo was taken in a place
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   where there were 2,000 to 3,000 people
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   who had to be moved to a refugee camp.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It was a camp.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It was a life camp.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It was like a camp for people to camp.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   4,000 people had to be moved
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   to that place for a few days.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Because the entire building
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   including the garden and several buildings
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   had to be cleaned.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   We still can't find the source of the virus.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   What's worse is that
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   although we know that eating fruit
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   is one of the reasons for the disease,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   we still can't change our habits
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   of eating wild fruits and fruit.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   At that time, I knew that
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   all the night markets
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   had removed the word "wild fruit"
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and replaced it with "seafood".
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   It was called "Seafood Night Market".
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   After removing the word,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   it was changed to "Seafood Night Market".
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Then the newspaper said
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that we would not eat it again.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You can try it today in Guangzhou.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   You can still eat
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   the food that was not allowed to be eaten.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   We can't change our eating habits.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   But in the whole of SARS,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   the most successful and unsuccessful
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   is the doctor named
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Mr. Tse Yuen-Wen.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I don't know if you still remember.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   He was a young doctor
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   at Tuen Mun Hospital.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   He was a Christian.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   He voluntarily went into the ward
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   to treat patients who couldn't breathe.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   But we didn't know how to prevent the infection.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   So he and another male nurse
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   were infected that day.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I went to Tuen Mun Hospital to treat him.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   But it was too late
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   because he was already infected.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   He couldn't even talk to me.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   A few days later, he passed away.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   It was May 12, 2003.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   After his death,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Hong Kong was in mourning
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   for this young cardiothoracic surgeon.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And in a newspaper,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   he used this chapter of the Bible as the headline.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   It said, "A piece of ink is not on the ground,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   but is still a piece of ink when it dies."
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   But if it dies,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   he will collect a lot of pieces of paper.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   That newspaper was banned in Hong Kong today.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   You know which one, right?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   The "Fruit Daily".
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I couldn't imagine
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   that the newspaper would use the Bible
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   to describe Tuen Mun.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   He sacrificed himself to save a patient.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And his influence is still in the medical field.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Many people think
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   he is a great sacrificial spirit.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   If we know he is a Christian,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   we may have seen his movies and songs
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   about his work.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   In Hong Kong, we call him
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   "The Daughter of Hong Kong".
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   It's a title with a lot of meanings.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Is he successful or failed?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Of course he failed.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   He was only 30 years old.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   But the piece of ink on the ground
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   has successfully influenced
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   many people's lives.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I'm not as great as him,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   but I have a little bit of this feeling.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Success or failure.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   After a year of SARS,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   the government investigated
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   whether the work of prevention and infection
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   was done well or not.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   At that time, some members of the committee
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   thought that the hospital staff
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   did not guard well.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   So the virus spread to the community.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I was investigated by the government
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   three times at that stage.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I was very depressed.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   I wanted to quit.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I wanted to leave Hong Kong.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I didn't want to be involved
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   in the political struggle
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   and the fall of the Li Kang.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   But at that moment,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I felt Jesus' words
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   in the cross.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   When he was nailed to the cross,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   he was about to die,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   he said to God,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "My God, why do you abandon me?"
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   He spoke Hebrew, I don't know how to read.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   He said, "My God, why do you abandon me?"
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Actually, at that moment,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I had told God in prayer,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   "My God, why do you abandon me?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Since you have led us
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   to pass through the SARS successfully,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   why do you give us
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   such a big challenge at this moment,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   even a dark day?"
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   But because of this reason,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   my life changed.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Because of this reason,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   it changed my life as a Christian.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   It is very important.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   If a piece of ink doesn't fall to the ground and die,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   it will only become one.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   So Jesus said,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   "You see success and failure
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   from a completely different perspective.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   There are countless examples in the Bible.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Everyone is familiar with this man,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Job.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   He was a very successful man
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   because he had wealth,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   a beautiful family,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and countless children.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   But overnight,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   because of the disaster
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   and being robbed,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   everything was gone.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   He even had a disease called Job's disease.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   This disease is mentioned in the Bible today.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   If you look at the Bible,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Job had a wound on his body.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   He had to use a toothpick
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   to cut out the wound.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   This disease is mentioned in the Bible today.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   A very painful life,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   from the moment of success to the moment of failure.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   The Bible used a long chapter
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   to explain to his friends and enemies,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   and everyone came to him to explain
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   why this happened.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   In the end,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   God did not give a very clear answer
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   why he was a good man,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   or even a man who was delighted by God.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Why did he change from the best blessing,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   the most successful position
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   to the most failed position?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   God did not explain.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   He just told him,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   "This is the reward I can give you."
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   In the end, he had all his family,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   his property, etc.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   In the process of suffering,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Job said,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   "I am born from the womb,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and I will return."
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "The one who wants to try is Jehovah,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and the one who receives is Jehovah."
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   "The name of Jehovah should be praised."
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Many people feel that
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   it seems to be not finished yet.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   God may not have been able to explain the whole thing clearly.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   But God did not explain clearly
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   why our success and failure.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   It's just to let you know that
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   in the process,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   when we are at our lowest point in life,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   it is also when God is closest to us.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   It is when you feel that
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   he can help you the most.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So this sentence, he said,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   "The greatest mystery in suffering
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   is how it can bring a person
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   into the presence of God."
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   God's appearance
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   is often at your most failed time,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   at your most troubled, painful time.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Then, he gives you a state of worship
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   full of wonder, love, and praise.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Let you truly enter
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   the stage of being with him.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I don't have much time to say
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   all I want to say today.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   If you have a chance to read this book,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   it is about a surgeon
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   at Stanford University.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   He was very young
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   and had just become a professor of brain surgery.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   He found himself with cancer.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   When he was cutting,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   his back suddenly hurt so much
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   that it fell to the ground.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   This book is about
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   the moment he found himself with cancer
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   and died.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   How did he change his life?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   The book is called "When Breath Becomes Air".
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   It is about the stage of his death.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   He found that
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   all our knowledge,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   wealth, and status
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   could not help him
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   face his death at that moment.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Then he returned to
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   the ultimate meaning of life.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I don't know if he was a Christian,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   but he found the answer
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   to his life's end
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   in pain.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   I want to talk about this
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   in a little more time.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   The Bible says
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   if you love your life,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   you will lose it.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   But if you hate your life,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   you will gain it.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   You will gain your life.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   The word "hate"
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   is very difficult to explain.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It does not mean you hate yourself.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It is more like
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   when you surrender,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   when you give yourself up,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   whoever can do this
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   will gain more life.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   The Bible talks about
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   how to surrender to God.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   There are three good examples.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   The first is when
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   the angel and the archangel were in a fight.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   The angel touched his thigh.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   His leg was bent.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   We believe he lost his thigh.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Sorry, doctors like to
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   think about what exactly
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   the disease was.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   We believe he lost his thigh
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   so he could not move.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   He grabbed the angel and said,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   "If you don't bless me,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I won't let you go."
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   This is when his own ability
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   and success were all in vain.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   God knows how to hold God back.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Open yourself to God.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   You can read this in the Bible.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   The second example I like is
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   when Joshua was facing the soldiers
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   before the battle.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Suddenly, an angel came out
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and said,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   "Are you helping us
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   or helping my enemies?"
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Joshua said,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   "I am not helping you
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   or your enemies.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I am here to lead
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   the army of the Lord."
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   "You are standing on the holy ground
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   so you must take off your shoes."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   "Take off your shoes"
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   means to take out your sovereignty
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   and let God govern you.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   The third example is
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   when you encounter many
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   unexplained problems in life.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   If you are a piece of ink,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   you don't need to know
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   all the answers
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   because you are in God's hands.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Just like Daniel,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   before he explained his dream,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   the king was a bit confused.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   He had a dream
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   but he forgot what it was.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   He needed someone to help him solve it.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   "You tell me
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   what dream you had."
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   He even forgot what his dream was.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   "You give me the answers."
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   But Daniel was able to get
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   the message of the salvation
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   from God.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   There are many big problems
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   in life.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   If we really fall on the ground,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   God will give us the answers.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Finally, the Bible says
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   if you want to follow me,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   you must follow me
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   wherever I go.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Finally, I want to tell you
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   the story of this friend I brought today.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   More than ten years ago,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I took a group of students from a Chinese university
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   to a place called Hsia Gan in Tai Yu Shan.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It's a place that is hard to get to.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   You need to take several boats to get there.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   There is a school there called
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   the Christian School of Bible.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Why did I know about this school?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Because there was a scandal
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   that the school was using money for personal gain.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   They wanted to move to a better place,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   but the local residents opposed it.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   So it was sold in the newspaper.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I saw that this place was very special
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   because it was for the young people
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   who were addicted and committed crimes
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   to return to the right path
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   and to use our Christian faith.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So I took a group of students and teachers
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   to visit this Christian school.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   I met a group of young people there.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   They were having a hard time.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   They had to carry the sand and mud
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   to build their own school.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Their place of residence was very simple.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I told the principal there,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   "Give me a chance to get to know
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   a few young people.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I hope I can help them get into university."
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   If one of them gets into university,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   we can give them a message
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   that society has not abandoned these young people.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   We can give them a chance.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   But as a university principal,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I can't just let them in
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   because I like them.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So I told them to find a few people
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   who are willing to study
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   and let me teach them.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I hope I can help them get into university
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and officially get into university.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   They chose three young people.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   The one in black on my right
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   is Dong, who will talk to you later.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   They came to my place once a month.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   They had to take a two-hour ride
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   to get to the beach.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I suggested they stay with me
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   and have dinner with me.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   I taught them English at night.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I only taught them English.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   The next day, the teacher drove them back.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   It took two hours.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   We brought three students.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Too many students couldn't handle it.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   I was a little scared once.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   I put them in my house.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   The next morning, I ran downstairs.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   I suddenly remembered that
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   there were three people with poison on me.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And a black tattoo on my body.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I lived there with my wife and two daughters.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   They were all women.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   I was a little scared.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   So I ran upstairs.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I didn't tell them,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   "You've never heard of this story."
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   I was a little scared.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   But they gave me a big surprise.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   They gave me a neck band.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I was so hot.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Three men gave me a neck band.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   It was extraordinary.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Today, I'd like to introduce you to
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You Yuen Tung.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   He's a social worker now.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   He's studying to be a social worker.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Please give him a round of applause.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Hello, I'm You Yuen Tung.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Today, I'm going to talk about success and failure.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Professor Shen said, "Can you talk about it?"
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "I only have a few minutes."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   But it's okay.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   When I see success and failure,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   some people don't know my background.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   They think I'm a social worker.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I've helped many young people
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   do a lot of education work.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   I've helped many young people in the black community.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I've helped them change their lives.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I've seen them succeed.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   But I've thought about
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   the times when I've failed.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Before I joined the Student Union,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   I thought I was a failure.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I've always had a habit of being a social worker.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I've always been so used to it.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Before I joined the Student Union,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   I've always thought I've never studied.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Throughout my middle school,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   people asked me what I studied.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I could say the name of the school,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   but I don't have any school memories.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   I always think my youth was a failure.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   But I don't know what I'm going to talk about today.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   But there's a sentence in the book
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   that says when you surrender,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   God will open the way for you.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I was 14, 12 to 18 years old.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I had a habit of being a social worker.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   I've been to a boy's kindergarten and a brothel.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   But I was never self-centered.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I told myself I would come back and continue to play.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I would definitely be a big brother.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   But before I joined the Student Union,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I wasn't arrested.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I was so self-conscious and weak.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   I told myself, "I've given up.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   I don't want to play anymore."
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   But I was allowed to join the Student Union.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It wasn't easy to get into the Student Union.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   You had to apply.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   There weren't many seats.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   But they allowed me in.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   I didn't have to go to court.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I volunteered to go in.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   After reading this sentence,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   I thought, "It seems like it."
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   When you surrender,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   and try to let go,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   God will open the way for you.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   But don't think you're good at studying
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   just because you joined the Student Union.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I didn't know why I chose this.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I didn't plan to study at first.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I thought I would quit my studies
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and come back to normal.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I'd been in prison for two years
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and never left.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   I thought I'd come back to being a normal person.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   As long as I didn't take drugs
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and didn't break the law, I'd be fine.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   But one day,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   people told me,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   "You're lucky Professor Shen helped you with your studies."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   I thought, "What's the point?"
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   They said, "He's famous."
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I thought, "Everyone wants this opportunity."
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I should study hard.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Study hard.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I'm grateful to the headmaster for helping me.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   God led me to
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   enter the College of Education and Training
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   and study a higher diploma
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   in the Social Work Department.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Studying doesn't mean anything.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I always tell him,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   "I studied so hard."
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   I always think,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   "I seem to be very successful.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I studied in a department and can study Social Work."
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   But in the end, I studied terribly.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I studied terribly.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   I remember my first semester,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I failed in all subjects.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I told him,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   "I can study,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   but that doesn't mean I can finish."
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   He kept encouraging me.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   I told myself, "It's okay.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   I'll try again."
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   He took a two-year course
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   in a higher diploma.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I studied for three and a half years and finished.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   But I was successful.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I graduated from the college five years ago
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   and became a Social Worker.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   People think I'm very successful,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   but I'm not.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I still have some dreams.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   For example,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   I told the headmaster
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   that he wanted me to enter the college.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I told myself,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   "I want to try hard and
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   take the quadruple crown."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I finally retook the course this year.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   I heard that
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   the Social Work course
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   I took in the college
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   was very bad.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   I thought I was already good at it.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   I could be a Social Worker,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   a teacher,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   and do what I wanted to do.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   I've always ignored my grades.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   But recently,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   I told myself,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   "I'll try to retake the course again."
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I kept encouraging him
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   and got a good result.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Before I left,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   I received an offer
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   from a school
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   to let me continue the course.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Sometimes I say,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   "God is very interesting.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   If you are willing to surrender
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   and He will return your trust,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   He will take you to more places."
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   This is my little sharing.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   If a piece of ink
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   hadn't fallen to the ground and died,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   it wouldn't have died,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   but it would have been a complete change.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   I believe
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   God will help more people.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   I hope today's message
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   can help us.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Maybe you feel your life is full of failure.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Maybe you feel
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   everything is not going well.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Or maybe you feel you are very mighty.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   You have become a high-ranking official
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   and made a lot of money.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   But God's definition
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   of success and failure
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   is often very different from ours.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   I hope we can
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   be in front of Him
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   and be praised by Him.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   We can be a faithful
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   and submissive
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   servant.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   That's all for today.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Thank you.
