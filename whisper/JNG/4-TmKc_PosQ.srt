00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hello, everyone. I am Mr. Lui.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Welcome to my lecture today.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Today's topic is "Science and Creativity".

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 I believe you all have the impression that

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 science and religion seem to have a lot of conflicts.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I believe that many times it is because we don't understand both sides,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 and that's why we have these misunderstandings.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I will try to share my understanding with you today.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 The content of my lecture today is partly based on

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Professor Kuo-king's time-lapse,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 and the books and videos of Professor Brian Cox of Manchester University.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I will also use the Bible to explain some of the topics related to creation today.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I would like to emphasize that the Bible is not a book of explanation,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 but its description of creation is in line with what we see now.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I will explain in detail later.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 In China, in the Western Zhou Dynasty,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 there was a saying that "the sky is round and the earth is flat".

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 At that time, people thought that the earth was square and flat,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 while the sky was round.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So the sun and moon rotated in this way.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 This kind of understanding affects other Chinese cultures.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 For example, the copper coin in the middle is square and the outside is round.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 This is the concept of "the sky is round and the earth is flat".

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 The sky is round and the earth is flat.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 The earth is flat and the earth is flat.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 The earth is flat and the earth is flat.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 This is the understanding of the universe of China 1000 years ago.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 In the 4th century BC,

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Aristotle predicted that the earth should be round, not square.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 In China, about 100 years after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 the "Cyclical Theory of Heaven" proposed by Zhang Heng

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 believed that the sky was like a shell,

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 and the earth was like a net,

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 but the earth was flat and floating in the water.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So the shell is rotating outside.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 But in the Old Testament, 700 years before the founding of the Chinese Communist Party,

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Aristotle had already said that the earth is round.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 He said that the gods are sitting on the big circle of the earth.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 The residents on the earth are like caterpillars.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 The gods are like a net, and the net is like a net.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 The sky is flat and the earth is flat.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 The net is like a net, and the earth is flat.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 The earth is like a net, and the net is like a net.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So in the Old Testament,

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 it was already said that the earth is round.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 God pushed the universe out like a growing wormhole.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 The earth we live on now is the solar system,

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 and the solar system is a part of the entire galaxy.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 How big is the entire galaxy?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 There are 100,000 light years from one side to the other.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I want to explain that light years are not a unit of time.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Light years are units of distance.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 A light year is the speed of light traveling a distance of one year.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 How fast does the light travel?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Every second can revolve around the earth and turn 7.5 times.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 This is the speed of light.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 So the universe is very big, so we have to use light years.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 But light years are not big enough.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Sometimes we use light years.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Light years is the distance of light traveling 100 million years.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 The distance of the galaxy is one thousandth of a light year.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The earth is one of the points.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You can't see it here.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 But the arrangement of the universe

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 was described in the book of 1,500 BC

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 as "God created the earth, and the origin is in the void."

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 There is nothing to be said.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So the part of creation in the Bible

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 is not a book to explain physics,

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 but its description is accurate.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 How big is the universe?

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 The universe is 930-940 light years.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 A light year is the distance.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I just said that the galaxy is only one thousandth of a light year.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 So the universe is very big.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 How do we know that the universe is expanding?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 This is a phenomenon called "red light."

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Everyone can feel it.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Imagine a ambulance coming towards you.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 You hear a very oppressive sound.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 When the ambulance leaves you,

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 the sound starts to relax.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 When the sound is getting farther and farther,

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 the sound is getting longer.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So in science,

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 the sound is moving towards the red side.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So we can see the light that is moving

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 and the light that is not moving.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 The universe can affect many people's thoughts.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 For example, in the 500 BC,

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Heraclitus, a philosopher,

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 turned the universe into a sealed space that would not move.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Heraclitus at that time was the same.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 When the universe is not big or small,

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 and it is forever like not moving,

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 people will generate some reincarnation thoughts.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 All things are reincarnated and have a cycle effect.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But if the universe is expanding,

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 it means that there is a possibility that it has a beginning.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So it is not a unchanging universe.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 In Professor Fok-Kun's time-scale,

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 there are many charts that help us understand the universe,

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 time and space.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 One of them is a knife-shaped ice cream can.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 What does he want to say?

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 He wants to say that if we imagine this board is a water,

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 there is no water wave at the beginning.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 If there is a stone in the middle,

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 the water waves will spread outwards.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 If the speed of this spreading outwards is the speed of light,

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 the speed of light is the fastest speed in the universe as we know.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It can't be faster than the speed of light.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Then in one second, the speed of light will spread outwards.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Two seconds is even faster.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Three seconds is even faster.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So this is the direction of time.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And this is the space that the speed of light can go.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So if the speed of light is the fastest,

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 the edge of the ice cream can is the limit.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Nothing can go faster than the edge of the ice cream can.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And all substances cannot spread as fast as light.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 So the substance can only exist in the space inside.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 This is what it means.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 When the universe is exploding,

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 the force that spreads outward and the force that absorbs inward

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 must have a relative balance.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Because if the expansion is too strong,

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 the space in the universe is too large,

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 it is difficult for the substance to absorb together and form a star.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 We call this the open universe.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 The open universe is difficult to make life or stars exist.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 But if the force of absorption is greater than the force of expansion,

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 the universe will quickly stick together and shrink back to a point.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So it becomes a closed universe.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 So scientists have calculated that

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 to make the universe continue,

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 the data that spreads outward must have a small error.

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 How small is this error?

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 According to the calculation of Professor Paul Davis,

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 a colleague of Professor Fok-Kam at Cambridge University,

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 this error cannot be greater than 1/10^60.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 What does this mean?

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 It means 0.591011 is so small.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It is so small that it may not make much sense to us.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 In fact, what helps us understand is that

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 the universe I just mentioned is 940 billion light-years large.

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 The difference between the universe from one side to the other

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 cannot be greater than the area of ​​a fingernail.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 This is the accuracy.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 If this accuracy is not reached,

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 the universe will not continue.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So Paul Davis said that

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 many scientists believe that

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 the universe is fine-tuned for life.

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It can be fine-tuned to allow life to exist.

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Although Paul Davis is not a Christian,

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 many scientists have seen a lot of accurate data in the universe.

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 When the accuracy is not good,

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 they believe that the universe is fine-tuned.

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Many books now use this "reverse speaker" to describe the expansion of the universe.

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 What does this speaker mean?

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 The lower part is the explosion point.

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 When it starts to explode, it is like blowing a balloon.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 When it is blown, the balloon suddenly expands very quickly.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 In English, it is called "inflation".

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Then the speed of the explosion will slow down.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 When it slows down to a certain extent,

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 we will find that the explosion is accelerating again.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So it is like a speaker.

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 The flat surface represents the size of the universe.

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Scientists did not know that the universe was expanding.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 The first time scientists proposed this calculation was in 1922.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It was only in 1929 that it was proven.

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's been about 100 years for our history.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 So don't think that science is very advanced.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 In fact, we are still very primitive.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 As I said,

178
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 the early 700s BC already knew that the universe was expanding.

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 The God "shut out the heavens"

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 and the God "spread them out"

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So to understand the explosion,

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 we need to understand it with some more specific concepts.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 First, I will talk about the relationship between solid and liquid,

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 the matter and the particles.

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Suppose we have an ice cube.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 If we heat the ice cube,

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 the ice will break into water.

188
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 When we heat it again,

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 the water particles will jump out and become air.

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 When we heat it again,

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 the water particles will break into acid.

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 The particles will jump out of the atoms and atoms.

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Generally speaking,

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 we call anything that can flow as a fluid.

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 For example, liquid, gas, particles can flow.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 These three are called fluids.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 What if we heat the particles again?

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 We break down the structure of the particles,

199
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 such as electrons, neutrons, and neutrons.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It becomes acid, 10 atomic particles.

201
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 What happens when we heat it again?

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It becomes energy, not matter.

203
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But the explosion is the other way around.

204
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 At first, all energy is at one point,

205
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 the temperature is extremely high.

206
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 When the explosion occurs,

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 the space expands and expands.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 The temperature drops,

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 and the particles start to form from energy.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Gradually, they become different kinds.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 When the temperature drops,

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 we can have gas, liquid, solid, etc.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 So the big explosion starts from here.

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 The simplest material in the universe is called gas.

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 The sun is mainly gas.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Most of the universe is gas.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Gas is the simplest.

218
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 The basic structure of a gas is that

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 there is a core in the middle.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 There are some positive and negative atoms in the core.

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 The neutral atoms are neither positive nor negative.

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 The negative atoms are in the electron.

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 They are rotating in the outer orbit.

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 The simplest structure of the universe is a negative atom.

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 The core in the middle has only one positive pole.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 There is an electron in the orbit.

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 The negative pole becomes a neutral negative atom.

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 The negative atom does not glow.

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 But when the electron absorbs energy in the orbit,

230
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 and jumps up to a higher orbit,

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and falls down,

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 it will emit blue light from the fifth orbit to the second orbit.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 The fourth orbit to the second orbit will emit green light.

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 The third orbit to the second orbit will emit red light.

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 These three colors are called tri-color.

236
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 These are the most basic colors.

237
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 The sun emits tri-color.

238
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 The LED emits these three colors.

239
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 What is the importance of the tri-color?

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It is easy to remember.

241
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 The logo of a TV is a tri-color.

242
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 The tri-color can be combined into five colors.

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 The sun emits these three colors,

244
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 and emits white light.

245
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The amazing thing is that the eyes of the gods

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 receive these three colors.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 So we see the colors because

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 the eyes of the gods have these sensors

249
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 that reflect these three colors.

250
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 There is a chart in the "Fork of Gold"

251
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 that shows the different stages of the universe after the explosion.

252
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 The first stage is a very short time,

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 called "Law of Physics Unknown".

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We don't know what physics is.

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I want you to pay attention to the upper part,

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 which is about temperature.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 The temperature is getting lower and lower.

258
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 The lower part is the time.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 The first part is the shortest part.

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Physics is unknown.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 It starts from zero to 0.42.0+1 seconds.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 In such a short time,

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 physics is unknown.

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So all the explosion theories

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 don't count this part at the beginning.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So they tell you directly that

267
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 there is no need for gods.

268
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Because the explosion is not included in the model.

269
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 They start from here.

270
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 As the explosion progresses,

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 the temperature on the top is getting lower and lower.

272
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Because the space is getting bigger and bigger.

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Time increases.

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 But the temperature is still 100 billion degrees in 1 second.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 If we feel 35 degrees is very hot,

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 51 degrees is very hot.

277
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Here it is 100 billion degrees in 1 second.

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 After the explosion,

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 it will be 10 billion degrees in 3 minutes.

280
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 So when the temperature is getting lower,

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 this graph shows that

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 from the atom to the atom,

283
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 then some substances appear.

284
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 The stars appear.

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 The star system is formed in about 10 billion years.

286
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Finally, the sun appears.

287
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I just explained that

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 the theory of quantum mechanics does not need gods.

289
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Because it does not start from zero.

290
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 The first part of physics cannot be explained.

291
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 So who started it?

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Science cannot explain.

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Science cannot explain whether there are gods.

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Now, in the theory of the explosion in 2022,

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I can explain with this graph.

296
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I want to emphasize that it is 2022.

297
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Why?

298
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Because in the past two years,

299
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 there have been many new discoveries.

300
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 The model is not accurate.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 I will explain later.

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 But the basic explanation is

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 when the explosion started,

304
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 it was very hot at first.

305
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 After the explosion, the space increased,

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 and some substances began to form.

307
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 The light had appeared at that time.

308
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 But the light could not come out.

309
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Because at that time,

310
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 the light and the electrons of other electrons

311
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 had interaction.

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 At this time, it was like a very thick soup.

313
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 The light could not come out.

314
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It was like a very large fog.

315
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 When the car lights were shot out,

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 the fog covered the light.

317
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 So at this time,

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 although the light had appeared,

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 there was light at first,

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 but the light could not come out.

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Around 380,000 years ago,

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 the light suddenly appeared.

323
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Why?

324
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Because the temperature had dropped.

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 The light particles and electrons

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 formed the simplest light atoms.

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 So suddenly the light appeared.

328
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Now we see the farthest light in the universe

329
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 is coming out at this time.

330
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 After the light appeared,

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 many light atoms began to form.

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 The light atoms, like fog,

333
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 covered the light.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So we have a period of dark ages.

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 According to the old model,

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 after 300 million years,

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 the stars appeared in 400 million years.

338
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Because at this time,

339
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 the stars began to accumulate together.

340
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 The stars have a nuclear fusion process,

341
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 producing some ultraviolet light.

342
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Ultraviolet light can make

343
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 the electrons in the nuclear fusion atoms

344
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 jump and start to emit light.

345
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Many stars have become a spiral structure.

346
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It is called a star system.

347
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It is estimated that it appeared after 100 million years.

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 The earth appeared after the explosion of 90 billion years.

349
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 The universe is now 137 years old.

350
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 So the earth is about 47 years old.

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 This is 2022.

352
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 I will use a simple chart to explain.

353
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 At first, it is estimated that

354
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 there were stars in 400 million years.

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 This is the period of dark ages.

356
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Although the light exists, it cannot come out.

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 There were stars in 100 million years.

358
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I want everyone to remember these two numbers.

359
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 There were stars in 400 million years and stars in 100 million years.

360
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Two years ago, the Space Agency sent

361
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 a new James Webb space telescope to the moon.

362
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It broke all our understanding of the beginning of the universe.

363
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 On April 7, 2023,

364
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 it was discovered that the earliest star system

365
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 was found in 300 million years.

366
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 We thought that the star system existed in 100 million years.

367
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Now, it has been found in 300 million to 500 million years.

368
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 So it broke the model of our ancient science.

369
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 In March of this year, it was found that

370
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 some stars have died in 700 million years.

371
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 What does it mean by dead?

372
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 It means that the whole star system cannot produce new stars.

373
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 But remember that in 700 million years,

374
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 the universe was still very early.

375
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Now we are talking about 137 billion years.

376
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 So 700 million years is still very early.

377
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But some stars have died.

378
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So they cannot produce new stars.

379
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Earlier this year, a British scientist

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 discovered a very strange phenomenon.

381
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 As I said, the universe is 940 billion light years large.

382
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Our galaxy is only one thousandth of a billion light years.

383
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 This British scientist noticed that

384
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 there are two huge structures in the universe.

385
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 These structures are made up of large stars.

386
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 One of them is called the Big Circle.

387
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Its diameter is 130 billion light years.

388
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Each point is a huge star.

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 The other is a larger arc.

390
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Its diameter is 130 billion light years.

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 This creator is still making some strange structures.

392
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 It looks like a smiley face.

393
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Very huge structure.

394
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 So it is very difficult for us scientists

395
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 to understand how these structures are formed.

396
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 As I mentioned, everyone noticed that

397
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 the model of science is not absolutely true.

398
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Science is just a tool of knowledge

399
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 for understanding the nature and physical world.

400
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Science is not absolutely true.

401
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Science must be constantly corrected.

402
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Science is an approximation to the truth

403
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 in a physical world.

404
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It cannot be true outside the physical world.

405
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 For example, science cannot be based on

406
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 a poem or a poem.

407
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 A painting is not beautiful.

408
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Parents' love for children is not science.

409
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It is not a physical field.

410
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Science has a very big limit.

411
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 It is not absolutely true.

412
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 So we must understand that

413
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 science has its own function.

414
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Science is not an absolute authority.

415
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 The Bible is not a book of science.

416
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 The Bible, especially the Book of Genesis,

417
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 is a literary text.

418
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It does not explain the universe in a physical way.

419
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 It is just a brief description of God's creation.

420
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 The main theme of Genesis is to declare

421
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 that God created the universe.

422
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 God created the universe with his sovereignty.

423
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 At first, God created the universe in a state of vacuum

424
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 and gradually became full of life and various miracles.

425
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 So the first three days are the basic preparation

426
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 for the fourth and fifth days.

427
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 The first day is the day of the sun.

428
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 The second day is the day of the vacuum.

429
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 The vacuum is water and sky.

430
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 The third day is the day of the plants.

431
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 The fourth day is the day of the stars.

432
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 The fourth day is the day of the sun.

433
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 The fifth day is the day of the vacuum.

434
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 The fifth day is the day of the plants.

435
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 The fifth day is the day of the birds.

436
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 The sixth day is the day of the animals.

437
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 This is the structure of the Bible.

438
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 The most important thing is to declare that the universe is God's creation.

439
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Although it seems to be very light,

440
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 the most important theme in the first four sentences

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 is God's creation.

442
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Although it is a few sentences in Hebrew,

443
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 the theory of the big explosion we just talked about

444
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 is not accurate now.

445
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 But we can understand the basic concept.

446
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 But the time, maybe we scientists

447
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 have to re-change the model

448
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 because of the new discovery in the past two years.

449
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Although they have to change the model again,

450
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 but we can notice that the basic words

451
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 and the framework of the universe

452
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 we have observed are consistent.

453
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 If we look back at the beginning of God's creation,

454
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 we can see that Professor Fok-Kam's picture

455
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 shows a moment of vacuum.

456
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Although God created light,

457
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 the light cannot come out.

458
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 There is a dark period.

459
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 After the dark period, the light comes out of the dark.

460
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 So the Bible mentions that light is good,

461
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 and the light and dark are separated.

462
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Light and dark are later to be separated.

463
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Of course, we can't say that these sentences

464
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 are the creation of the whole universe.

465
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Because it is a literary description,

466
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 not a theoretical description.

467
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 But I want to say that

468
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 the Bible says that God created the universe.

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 This is the point.

470
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 But in the Bible,

471
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 the creation of the universe is mainly about the earth

472
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 from the second day to the sixth day.

473
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 The first day is about the universe,

474
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and the second to the sixth day is about the earth.

475
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It is more detailed.

476
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And in the Bible,

477
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 there is a detailed description of

478
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 the understanding of the earth

479
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 by modern scientists.

480
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 They believe that the earth was a very hot fluid at first.

481
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 A very hot fluid.

482
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 I just mentioned the fluid,

483
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 including the solid, liquid and gas.

484
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It was very hot at first.

485
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 At first, they thought that

486
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 the earth we were born on had no atmosphere.

487
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Even if there was, there was no oxygen.

488
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Because what did the gas look like?

489
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 It was like the gas that came out of the volcano.

490
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 It was a poisonous gas,

491
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 like sulfur.

492
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 It was not a transparent gas.

493
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 So they estimated that

494
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 the earliest living creatures on this earth

495
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 came from the ocean

496
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 and absorbed sulfur.

497
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 The earliest living creatures

498
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 absorbed these toxins

499
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 and produced oxygen.

500
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Oxygen is transparent.

501
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 When it absorbs toxins from the atmosphere

502
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 and produces oxygen,

503
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 the atmosphere becomes transparent.

504
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 When there is oxygen, other creatures can slowly form.

505
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 For example, fish, reptiles, abalone, and finally humans.

506
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 This is the current understanding of modern scientists.

507
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 If we pay attention to the Bible,

508
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 it is very strange.

509
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 The four sentences I said on the first day

510
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 are about the formation of the universe.

511
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 From the second day to the sixth day,

512
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 it is about humans.

513
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Here it talks about the water of the pig.

514
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 There are different types of fluids.

515
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 The water is divided into up and down.

516
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Some fluids are heavier, some are lighter.

517
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Some fluids are heavier, some are lighter.

518
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The use of sulfur is heavy,

519
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 the use of water is light,

520
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 the use of steam is light.

521
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 The fluid is divided into up and down.

522
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 If you have ever been on a plane,

523
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 you will notice that

524
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 when you fly to a few thousand feet,

525
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 the outside temperature may be -60 °C or -70 °C.

526
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 When you fly to a higher level,

527
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 the temperature is low,

528
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 the steam will turn into water and fall to the ground.

529
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 The ground will form a geological shell.

530
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 The geological shell of our planet is very thin.

531
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 It is about 15 to 20 km on average.

532
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 So our planet is like an orange.

533
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 There is a hard skin.

534
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 There are many fluids and fluids in the middle.

535
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 There is a lot of hot sulfur.

536
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 A lot of melted iron is spinning here.

537
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 So the sequence here is that

538
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 there is water at the beginning,

539
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 the water falls to the ground,

540
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 the ground is cooled and formed a geological shell.

541
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Then the water is collected in the geological shell

542
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 and becomes the sea.

543
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 When there is a sea, there is no rain.

544
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 According to the Bible,

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 first there is a green plant,

546
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 a plant of iron seeds,

547
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 a green creature.

548
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Why green creature?

549
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Because of the effect of the sun.

550
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 First, it absorbs the smoke from the atmosphere.

551
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Then it excretes oxygen.

552
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 So with these carbon dioxide,

553
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 the green plant that absorbs the sun's effect and produces oxygen,

554
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 like the seaweeds,

555
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 we have a large atmosphere.

556
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Then, the third one,

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 we see two rivers,

558
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 the first is the Yangtze River,

559
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 where we see the sun and the moon.

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Then, the creatures appear,

561
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 which is water,

562
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 and come out of the water.

563
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 It is the same as what scientists believe now.

564
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Then there is a bird.

565
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Then there is a big fish.

566
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 In Chinese, it is also called big fish.

567
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 In English, it is a monstrous creature.

568
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 It is very huge,

569
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 maybe similar to

570
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 dinosaurs.

571
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Then, at the end,

572
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 there are insects,

573
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 beasts,

574
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 and other creatures.

575
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Finally,

576
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 according to the image of God,

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 we have to follow our own image,

578
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 and finally become human.

579
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 The last one is

580
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Moses.

581
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 At least 1500 years ago,

582
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 that is,

583
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 3,500 years ago,

584
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 God moved him to write the Bible.

585
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 He did not have

586
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 modern scientific knowledge.

587
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 He did not even know

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 the disease,

589
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 the bacteria.

590
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 But God let him write

591
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 this order,

592
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 which is the same as

593
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 what we scientists understand now.

594
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 This is the miracle of the Bible.

595
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 I want to explain one more sentence.

596
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 God said,

597
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 we have to follow our image,

598
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 and finally become human.

599
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Why is this sentence important?

600
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Because I believe that

601
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 there are misunderstandings

602
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 in the scientific world.

603
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Some people say

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 that if you count the history of

605
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 the Israelites to the time of Adam,

606
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 it may be around 7,000 years.

607
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 If I find a human

608
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 with a human skeleton

609
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 of 20,000 years,

610
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 how do you explain it?

611
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 The DNA is very close.

612
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 The Bible says that

613
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 the definition of human

614
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 is not from the DNA,

615
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 but from the image of God.

616
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 God may have done something

617
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 similar to humans

618
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 10,000 years ago.

619
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 DNA is a very close creature.

620
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 But those creatures at that time

621
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 did not have God's image,

622
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 no God's spirit,

623
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 and could not communicate with God.

624
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 So God did not

625
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 have a human skeleton.

626
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 So the human in the Bible

627
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 is not defined by DNA,

628
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 but by the image of God.

629
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Here, we are the three-dimensional

630
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 God, the image of God.

631
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 This is the definition

632
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 of the human in the Bible.

633
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 So if we find a human skeleton

634
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 with a human DNA,

635
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 it is also a human,

636
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 not a human.

637
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 So we can say that

638
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 the human is a human.

639
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 The human is a human.

640
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Not a human.

641
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 As I said,

642
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 the most amazing thing in the Bible

643
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 is that Moses did not study

644
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 at a modern university.

645
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 He did not have the knowledge

646
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 of modern science.

647
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 But he wrote the book

648
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 "The Book of Genesis"

649
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 more than 3,000 years ago.

650
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Although it is not a materialistic book,

651
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 it has a lot of precise

652
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 definition of the universe.

653
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 As I said,

654
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 in the 1500 BC,

655
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 God created the earth

656
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 in the sky

657
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 with the power of man.

658
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 The sky is the structure.

659
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 In God's eyes,

660
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 a thousand years are as one day,

661
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 a day is as a thousand years.

662
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 This is the relative theory

663
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 we know now.

664
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 These concepts have existed

665
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 since ancient times.

666
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 As I mentioned,

667
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 God knew that the earth

668
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 was a structure created

669
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 by the expansion of the universe.

670
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 God used his power to create the earth.

671
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 This is a wise world.

672
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I will explain the wisdom

673
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 later.

674
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 So we notice that

675
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 the universe expansion

676
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 we can observe now,

677
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 the order in which the earth

678
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 and the organisms are formed,

679
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 the order in which the organisms

680
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 are formed,

681
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 the description in the Bible

682
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 is the same.

683
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 These scientific interpretations

684
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 are described in the Bible.

685
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 As I mentioned,

686
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 wisdom,

687
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 we know that DNA

688
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 is not just a material,

689
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 DNA is a program of life.

690
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 There is a programmer,

691
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 there must be a person

692
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 behind the programmer.

693
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Because the creator is the source of wisdom.

694
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 So we can't say

695
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 there is only material.

696
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 There is no other.

697
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Because we can see

698
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 there is a creator behind this material.

699
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 There is a creator behind this material.

700
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Human knowledge of science

701
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 is very short and very active.

702
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 We only know that a battery

703
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 will produce a battery wall

704
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 in 1820.

705
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 God has already predicted

706
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 that in the early days of creation.

707
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 As I mentioned,

708
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 the rocks in the middle of the earth

709
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 are still flowing.

710
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 There are a lot of iron

711
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 in the middle of the earth

712
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 flowing like lava.

713
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 This lava

714
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 is like an electricity

715
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 and produces a battery wall.

716
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 This battery wall is very important

717
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 because when the sun storm

718
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 hits us,

719
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 it is a shield, a protective shield.

720
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 So our earth still has a large atmosphere.

721
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And the atmosphere of Mars

722
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 is already very thin.

723
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Because the atmosphere

724
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 of the earth

725
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 has already blown away

726
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 the atmosphere of Mars.

727
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Because we have this

728
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 protective shield,

729
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 we can survive.

730
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 We see the polar lights,

731
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 the polar lights,

732
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 when the solar panels

733
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 hit us,

734
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 they dissipate

735
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 the energy in the air.

736
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 So we see the light.

737
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 But this is a protective shield.

738
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Without the protective shield,

739
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 all living things cannot survive.

740
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 So when the sun storm

741
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 hits us,

742
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 it is very kind to us

743
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 to arrange this

744
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 battery wall for us.

745
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 This chart represents

746
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 the earth surrounded by the sun.

747
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 We have four seasons here.

748
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Last week

749
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 was summer.

750
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 If you think about

751
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 the summer,

752
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 we are facing the sun

753
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 at noon.

754
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Do you know

755
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 how many times

756
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 the earth rotates itself?

757
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Many people answer

758
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 one circle.

759
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 One circle is 360 degrees.

760
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 But if we really

761
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 rotate 360 degrees,

762
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 there will be a problem.

763
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 Why?

764
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 If we rotate

765
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 one circle a day,

766
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 the sun will be here

767
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 in the future.

768
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 After half a year,

769
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 when noon comes,

770
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 we will be here

771
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 on the day of winter solstice.

772
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 We will not face the sun.

773
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 The sun will be at night.

774
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 It turns out that

775
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 God is very wonderful.

776
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 God makes the arrangement

777
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 of the earth surrounded by the sun.

778
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 He rotates 0.9856 degrees

779
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 with us every day.

780
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 One circle is 360 degrees.

781
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 It turns out that

782
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 the earth rotates

783
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 360.9856 degrees.

784
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Why?

785
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 We have 365 days

786
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 or 365 days

787
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 in a year.

788
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 In addition to the second,

789
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 we have half a year

790
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 to winter solstice.

791
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Every day,

792
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 we have more than

793
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 one day of winter solstice.

794
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 If we add 0.9856 degrees,

795
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 it will be 180 degrees.

796
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Originally,

797
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 when we were here

798
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 and went to winter solstice,

799
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 God made us

800
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 more than one degree.

801
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 When we are in winter solstice,

802
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 noon is also

803
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 under the sun.

804
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Isn't it wonderful?

805
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 So you notice

806
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 that when the creator of the world

807
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 is extremely wonderful,

808
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 he even arranged

809
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 the earth to rotate a little more

810
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 for us.

811
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 We see that science

812
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 cannot prove

813
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 that God exists.

814
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Science is only applied in the natural world

815
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 and the material world.

816
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 God is a spirit.

817
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 So science is not an absolute truth.

818
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Science is only limited to

819
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 the approximation to the truth

820
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 in the physical world.

821
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Science is not a authority.

822
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 God made people

823
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 in the absolute world

824
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 through a revelation.

825
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 God made people

826
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 in the non-absolute world

827
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 through a revelation.

828
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 After people were made,

829
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 they produced

830
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 many different knowledge.

831
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Science is only one of the knowledge

832
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 that can be applied

833
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 in the material world.

834
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 It cannot explain

835
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 art,

836
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 love of parents to children,

837
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 art, poetry, songs, and dance.

838
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Science cannot do that.

839
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Science is limited.

840
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 If we look at the future prediction,

841
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 people in the superstition

842
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 will look at the whole.

843
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 But if we look at how science is applied,

844
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 economic prediction,

845
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 weather prediction, and science prediction

846
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 are not accurate.

847
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 So we always blame

848
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 the astronomical observatory for bad predictions.

849
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 We will say they are not doing enough.

850
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 But in fact, they have limitations.

851
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Although they have all the super computers,

852
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 but because science is limited,

853
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 science is only slowly

854
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 approaching the truth.

855
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 It is not the truth itself.

856
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 If you look at the Bible,

857
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 you will notice that

858
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 the Bible is very different.

859
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 The words of God in the Bible

860
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 whether you like it or not,

861
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 it must happen.

862
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 So the words of God in the Bible

863
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 I will explain later.

864
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Why does God

865
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 have to be disdainful?

866
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 The Bible has already said,

867
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 "My will is not your will,

868
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 your way is not my way,

869
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 how high is the sky above the earth,

870
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 how high is my way above your way,

871
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 how high is my will above your will."

872
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 This is what God

873
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 announced to us.

874
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 God is much higher than us.

875
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 God is much higher than us.

876
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 God is much higher than us.

877
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 God is much higher than us.

878
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 I use these two photos

879
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 to explain what is disdainful.

880
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 This photo

881
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 is taken with my dog

882
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 when we were playing.

883
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 My dog is a smart dog.

884
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 I really went to class with him

885
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 and got his certificate.

886
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 But no matter how good he is,

887
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 I do research, I watch TV,

888
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 or I listen to music,

889
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 I will not explain to my dog.

890
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Because his

891
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 cognitive ability is limited.

892
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 Every time

893
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 I teach him

894
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 some knowledge from a higher level of wisdom

895
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 to a lower level of wisdom,

896
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 I call it a "discourse".

897
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 I can teach him to do things

898
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 he can't do normally.

899
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 For example, I can teach him

900
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 not to pick up food from the table

901
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 and eat it when it falls to the ground.

902
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Just like in the Olympic Games,

903
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 the chess competition,

904
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 the chess players

905
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 can train the horse to dance.

906
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 The horse doesn't know how to dance.

907
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 From a higher level of wisdom

908
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 to a lower level of wisdom

909
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 to teach and pass on some knowledge

910
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 is called "discourse".

911
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 The same reason,

912
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 God gives people

913
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 the highest level of creativity,

914
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 gives us the smartest rationality.

915
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 I use this yellow circle

916
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 to represent people's rationality.

917
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 If God's wisdom is infinite,

918
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 then we can't

919
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 be as smart as God.

920
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 God's wisdom is far

921
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 higher than our mind.

922
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 God's wisdom is far higher than our mind.

923
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 God's wisdom is far higher than our mind.

924
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 If God's wisdom is infinite,

925
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 then it is impossible

926
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 to try to describe

927
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 an infinite God

928
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 with human's wisdom

929
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 and rationality.

930
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 So,

931
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 when Thomas Jefferson

932
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 said a very important

933
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 principle,

934
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 God creates human's rationality,

935
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 human's rationality

936
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 cannot create God,

937
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 human's rationality

938
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 can only create God and images.

939
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 I want to say it again.

940
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 God creates human's rationality,

941
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 this small rationality,

942
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 human's rationality

943
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 cannot create an infinite God,

944
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 human's rationality

945
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 can only create God and images.

946
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 I will give you

947
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 a few examples to explain

948
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 what Thomas Jefferson said.

949
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 The most famous

950
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 "Fortnite Theorem"

951
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 is the "Theorem of Music".

952
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Music is a 18th century

953
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Scottish philosopher.

954
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Many modern

955
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 philosophers and philosophers

956
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 use similar

957
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 theories to try

958
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 to prove that God is

959
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 bad.

960
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 What did he say?

961
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 If God is good,

962
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 he will not allow

963
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 evil and sin in the world.

964
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 If God is all-powerful,

965
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 he has the ability to

966
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 stop evil and sin.

967
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 But in fact,

968
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 the world is full of evil and sin.

969
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 So, he used

970
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 the "Fortnite Theorem"

971
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 in the very small circle

972
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 to deduce that if God is good,

973
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 he is not all-powerful

974
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 because he has no ability

975
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 to stop evil and sin.

976
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 So, they used the

977
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 limited wisdom of people

978
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 to deduce a God.

979
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Their God said

980
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 God cannot be all-powerful

981
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 and good at the same time.

982
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 This is what Thomas Jefferson

983
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 said very clearly.

984
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 People use their limited wisdom

985
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 to try to describe an infinite God.

986
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 God can only produce a false god.

987
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 This false god cannot be all-powerful

988
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 and not all-powerful.

989
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 God cannot be all-powerful

990
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 and not all-powerful at the same time.

991
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 This is the most exquisite observation

992
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 of Thomas Jefferson.

993
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Not only this,

994
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 there are also

995
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 such stories in the Old Testament.

996
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 When Moses went to Mount Sinai

997
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 to receive the Ten Commandments,

998
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 the Israelites

999
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 were making gold bulls

1000
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 at the bottom.

1001
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 This gold bull was not an idol.

1002
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 This gold bull was a gift

1003
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 from the Israelites.

1004
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 They wanted a God

1005
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 who could produce

1006
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 and understand

1007
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 God.

1008
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 A God

1009
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 who can produce,

1010
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 control

1011
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 and understand

1012
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 God

1013
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 cannot be a true God.

1014
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 It can only be a false God.

1015
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 This is the explanation

1016
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 of Thomas Jefferson's observation.

1017
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 There are so many human rationalities.

1018
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 They are all made up rationalities.

1019
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 To try to explain the infinite wisdom of God,

1020
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 we can only make a false God.

1021
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 So you can see

1022
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 that whether you don't believe

1023
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 God's wisdom,

1024
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 believe God,

1025
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 but believe God in your own way,

1026
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 the Israelites

1027
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 also produced a false God.

1028
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 Their conclusion is also a false God.

1029
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 Now many people

1030
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 are also making a false God.

1031
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 They are trying to

1032
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 infer God's wisdom

1033
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 from the rationalities of the people.

1034
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 You may have heard of this question.

1035
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 If God is omnipotent,

1036
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 can he make a big stone

1037
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 that he can't lift?

1038
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Whether it is a big stone

1039
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 that cannot be lifted,

1040
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 or a car,

1041
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 what he wants to say is

1042
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 if God is omnipotent,

1043
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 can he not be omniscient?

1044
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 If we turn this into

1045
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 a sentence,

1046
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 if A is God,

1047
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 B is omnipotent,

1048
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 he asks

1049
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 if A is equal to B,

1050
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 can A not be equal to B?

1051
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 This is a theory

1052
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 based on human limitations.

1053
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 Where is this question?

1054
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 If A is equal to B,

1055
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 can A not equal to B?

1056
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 This is a question of the question itself.

1057
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Because this question itself is not logical.

1058
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 A question that is not logical

1059
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 is not a logical answer.

1060
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 So when people think they are very smart,

1061
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 and try to infer an infinite God

1062
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 with human rationality,

1063
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 they can only come up with

1064
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 such a mistake.

1065
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 We often get stuck here.

1066
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 In fact, if people think clearly,

1067
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 all the miracles of Jesus Christ

1068
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 cannot be understood

1069
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 by human rationality.

1070
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 So we actually need

1071
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 God's inspiration

1072
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 to understand

1073
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 God's inspiration.

1074
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 God's inspiration,

1075
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 I call this part "exceeding our rationality".

1076
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 It is God's inspiration.

1077
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 So God's words,

1078
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 God's deeds,

1079
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 are what we need to accept.

1080
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 Even if we accept

1081
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 God's inspiration,

1082
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 we only know

1083
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 infinite God a little more.

1084
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 We will never fully understand

1085
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 this God.

1086
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 Because if we really understand this God,

1087
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 we will only be

1088
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 a false God in this larger area.

1089
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 So people in this area

1090
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 often be a false God.

1091
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 People who are willing to

1092
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 accept God's inspiration

1093
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 and exceed their rationality

1094
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 to accept and believe in God

1095
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 are only a little more intelligent.

1096
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 We will never fully understand God.

1097
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 So we need to know

1098
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 where our limitations are.

1099
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 How to pursue truth?

1100
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 There are ways to be faithful to others,

1101
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 ways to be faithful to God.

1102
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 In the past,

1103
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 there were Heraclitus of Helium,

1104
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 Buddha, Confucius, and Lao Tzu.

1105
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 These are all great people.

1106
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 They pursued truth all their lives,

1107
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 and tried to find the truth

1108
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 through many years of life experience.

1109
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 But why did they find the truth?

1110
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 Because they were not the truth.

1111
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 This is also pointed out

1112
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 by Thomas Lembke.

1113
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 These people

1114
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 have pursued the truth all their lives

1115
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 because they were not the truth.

1116
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 We can see in the Bible

1117
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 that Jesus Christ

1118
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 was baptized

1119
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 at the age of 30

1120
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 according to the Old Testament.

1121
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 He was baptized at the age of 30.

1122
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 At first,

1123
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 he claimed that

1124
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 he was the way, the truth, and the life.

1125
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 He claimed that

1126
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 he was the only way, the justice

1127
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 between him and the Father and the eternal life.

1128
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 He was the truth itself.

1129
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 He was the source of life.

1130
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 Life was like the Lord of our lives.

1131
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 In John 1,

1132
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 the first chapter,

1133
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 "The beginning of the world is the way,"

1134
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 this "way" is about Jesus Christ.

1135
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 Because Satan,

1136
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 after Jesus Christ ascended to heaven,

1137
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 about 5 to 60 years later,

1138
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 he subdued his knowledge

1139
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 of Jesus Christ

1140
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 and wrote down

1141
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 John's Gospel.

1142
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 At that time,

1143
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 his other disciples

1144
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 had all died.

1145
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Only John's Gospel

1146
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 and the Book of Mormon

1147
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 were left.

1148
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 It is mentioned here

1149
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 that the first creation

1150
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 had this "way" and this "truth."

1151
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 This "truth" is Jesus Christ.

1152
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 This "way" and this "truth"

1153
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 are in the same place with God.

1154
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 This "way" is God.

1155
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 What does it mean?

1156
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 We usually think that the truth

1157
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 is the philosophical thought

1158
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 found by some intellectuals.

1159
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 It is wrong.

1160
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 Here it tells us

1161
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 that God is the true essence of truth.

1162
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 God is the truth of life.

1163
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 God is the absolute truth.

1164
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 And the absolute truth

1165
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 is the truth

1166
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 because God is the true essence of truth.

1167
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 The opinions he expresses

1168
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 and the words he speaks

1169
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 are the truth.

1170
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 He has the light,

1171
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 and it becomes reality.

1172
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 This is God's ability.

1173
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 He is the truth.

1174
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 What he says will happen.

1175
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 So, everything is done by God.

1176
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 God also announces

1177
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 that the whole universe

1178
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 is done by God.

1179
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 Here, especially Jesus Christ,

1180
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 the Holy Trinity,

1181
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 everything is done by God.

1182
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 Everything is done by God.

1183
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 His life is in Him.

1184
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 He is the source of life.

1185
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 Life is the light of man.

1186
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 But the light shines in darkness,

1187
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 and man does not shine in light.

1188
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 If we look at this chart,

1189
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 God is in the absolute world,

1190
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 in the eternal world,

1191
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 free and eternal,

1192
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 justice, holiness,

1193
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 love and the true essence.

1194
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 When he led Jesus Christ

1195
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 to create the universe,

1196
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 the world of creation,

1197
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 Jesus Christ claimed

1198
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 that he was the Alpha,

1199
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 the Creator,

1200
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 so the whole human history

1201
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 is in the hands of Jesus Christ.

1202
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 From the eternal world of God

1203
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 to the world of his own creation,

1204
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 Jesus Christ

1205
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 is the one who created

1206
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 the universe.

1207
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 He is the only way to return to eternity.

1208
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 So in the Bible,

1209
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 we should not be surprised

1210
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 by some very clear proclamation.

1211
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 For example,

1212
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 in the book of Timothy,

1213
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 there is only one God

1214
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 in the middle of God and man,

1215
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 there is only one God,

1216
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 and that is Jesus Christ,

1217
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 who was born for man.

1218
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 There is no salvation other than him,

1219
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 because in the world of man

1220
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 there is only one God,

1221
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 and that is Jesus Christ.

1222
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 So we can see that

1223
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 science is just a part

1224
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 of the pre-made wisdom,

1225
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 and the pre-made science

1226
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 cannot prove the wonder of God.

1227
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 So you can see that

1228
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 even if we go back to the theory of the big explosion,

1229
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 all scientists cannot go back

1230
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 to the point of the explosion,

1231
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 because for a while,

1232
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 physics cannot be applied.

1233
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 So all his theories

1234
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 of the big explosion

1235
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 started after the explosion.

1236
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 So science cannot prove

1237
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 the existence of God.

1238
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 But God himself

1239
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 gives us general and special

1240
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 instructions

1241
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 to let us know that he exists.

1242
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 The general instructions are

1243
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 his creation and to give people

1244
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 a conscience,

1245
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 to create for us to have different knowledge,

1246
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 a conscience,

1247
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 so that we can develop religion and science,

1248
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 but most importantly,

1249
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 God gives special instructions,

1250
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 special instructions,

1251
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 God gives the Bible,

1252
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 God's words,

1253
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 and Jesus Christ's coming to tell us

1254
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 what God is like.

1255
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 So God's existence

1256
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 is not proven by science,

1257
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 so there is no need for

1258
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 any scientific evidence.

1259
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 Science cannot prove

1260
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 the existence of God or not.

1261
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 God's existence is

1262
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 God's own manifestation.

1263
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 The Bible says so.

1264
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 The Bible says that God's righteousness

1265
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 is manifested in the voice,

1266
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 God's anger is manifested in heaven,

1267
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 God's things are manifested by God himself.

1268
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 It is not that people look for God,

1269
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 people cannot find God,

1270
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 but God finds people.

1271
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 But people usually need to see

1272
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 the results of God,

1273
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 understand rationally,

1274
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 then believe,

1275
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 like a goldfish,

1276
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 and then believe in God.

1277
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 But the Bible has a very strange principle,

1278
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 that is, by faith,

1279
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 not by eye,

1280
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 I will explain later.

1281
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 Let's look at the results.

1282
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 The Bible says that

1283
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 Jews need to see the results,

1284
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 and the Hebrews need to seek wisdom,

1285
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 that is, to understand rationally.

1286
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 People are like this now,

1287
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 so people need to see with their eyes,

1288
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 understand rationally.

1289
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 So some people always say,

1290
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 "Why don't you call your Jesus

1291
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 to come down and see me?

1292
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 I believe when I see him."

1293
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
 So people are often trapped

1294
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 in the eyes of the eye,

1295
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 and understand rationally.

1296
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 The Bible says that

1297
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 the way out is by faith,

1298
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 not by these two things.

1299
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 Can God make people believe?

1300
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 When we look at the book of Acts,

1301
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 God separated the Red Sea

1302
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 from the West,

1303
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 and the Israelites passed through

1304
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 the desert on the other side

1305
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 of the Red Sea.

1306
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 They saw the Red Sea

1307
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 separated and they did not believe.

1308
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 They had no water,

1309
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 no food,

1310
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 and Moses had killed them.

1311
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 They had nothing to eat.

1312
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 God gave them some food

1313
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 called "Mala" in heaven every day.

1314
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 They ate it every day,

1315
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 and saw Mala and miracles every day.

1316
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 They did not believe.

1317
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 They went to the West Mountain,

1318
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 and they built a false god

1319
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 called "Bai-Kim-Nau"

1320
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 in their hearts.

1321
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 Finally, they went to the land of Canaan,

1322
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 the land of the angels.

1323
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 They sent 12 scouts

1324
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 to this new place.

1325
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 None of them believed.

1326
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 The result was very, very miserable.

1327
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 The miserable result was

1328
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 that the Israelites

1329
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
 had been in the desert for 40 years.

1330
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
 This generation of disbelievers

1331
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 could not enter the land of Canaan

1332
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 and the land of the angels.

1333
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
 This is the miserable result.

1334
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 Can the miracle make us believe?

1335
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 In fact, everything God does

1336
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 is a miracle.

1337
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 Your and my life

1338
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 is a miracle.

1339
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 Your and my heartbeats

1340
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 do not depend on

1341
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 your and my efforts.

1342
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 You can ask God to jump faster

1343
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 or slower,

1344
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 but you cannot ask God to jump or not jump.

1345
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 It is the grace of God

1346
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
 that keeps our lives going.

1347
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 Your and my existence

1348
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
 is not our choice.

1349
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 But today,

1350
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 when we live and see

1351
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 the miracles every day,

1352
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 people do not believe.

1353
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 So it is useless to see the miracles.

1354
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 Is reason important?

1355
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 We need to understand that reason is important.

1356
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
 But we need to understand that reason

1357
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 also has its functions and limitations.

1358
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 The reason God gives people

1359
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 is beyond other creatures.

1360
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 So reason is important.

1361
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 But we need to pay attention to

1362
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 that reason is not rational.

1363
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Many people do not believe in God,

1364
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 but believe in the devil.

1365
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 Many people believe in eternal life

1366
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 and eternal life.

1367
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 But they tell you that

1368
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 death is like a light.

1369
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 What evidence do you have to prove that?

1370
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 No evidence.

1371
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 It is not rational.

1372
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 Many people believe in themselves

1373
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 when they are not sick or cold.

1374
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 But when they have symptoms,

1375
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
 they hope to have a miracle.

1376
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 Right?

1377
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 So atheism is also irrational.

1378
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 God's existence does not matter

1379
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
 whether I believe in him or not.

1380
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 It does not matter if I say he exists or not.

1381
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 Reason has limitations.

1382
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 I just explained that

1383
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 people's reason is limited.

1384
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
 A limited reason

1385
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 cannot understand

1386
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
 this infinite God.

1387
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 We need to rely on enlightenment.

1388
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
 So our common mistake is

1389
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 people's limited reason and

1390
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
 selective wisdom

1391
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 limit God's enlightenment.

1392
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 This human reason

1393
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 becomes a difficulty

1394
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 to understand God.

1395
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 I just gave three examples.

1396
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 The theory of music.

1397
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 Can God be human?

1398
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 This is a theory that

1399
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 the stone cannot lift.

1400
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 This is a theory that

1401
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 God's enlightenment

1402
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 is limited.

1403
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
 God's enlightenment

1404
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
 is limited.

1405
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 God's enlightenment

1406
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 is limited.

1407
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 God's enlightenment

1408
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 is limited.

1409
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 God's enlightenment

1410
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 is limited.

1411
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 God's enlightenment

1412
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 is limited.

1413
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
 God's enlightenment

1414
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
 is limited.

1415
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
 God's enlightenment

1416
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 is limited.

1417
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 God's enlightenment

1418
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
 is limited.

1419
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 Some people say whether to believe or not

1420
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 does not matter.

1421
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 Look at the Bible.

1422
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 God's existence or not

1423
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 does not matter to people's subjective opinion.

1424
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 God does not exist

1425
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 because I believe in him.

1426
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 God does not exist because I do not believe in him.

1427
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 So whether you and I

1428
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 believe God exists or not

1429
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
 does not matter to people's subjective opinion.

1430
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 We are trapped

1431
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 in the theory of a person.

1432
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 We just pretend to be a God.

1433
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 We just pretend to be a God.

1434
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 There is also a choice problem in the theory of God.

1435
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 I once gave a lecture

1436
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 to a brother.

1437
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
 He told me

1438
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
 that he believed

1439
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 in many of Jesus'

1440
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
 miracles.

1441
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
 The only thing he did not believe in was the resurrection of Jesus.

1442
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
 I looked at this picture.

1443
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 All of Jesus'

1444
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 miracles

1445
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
 are accepted

1446
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 in the theory of supernatural.

1447
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
 If people have a choice

1448
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 whether to believe or not,

1449
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 I cannot see the whole

1450
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 enlightenment of God.

1451
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 Even in the Bible,

1452
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 some people ask me to

1453
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 give a blessing, I will listen.

1454
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
 Some people ask me to change

1455
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 my sinful behavior,

1456
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 I do not want to listen.

1457
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
 People have a choice.

1458
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 Wisdom is not unimportant.

1459
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
 God gives us

1460
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 the highest rationality.

1461
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 So we

1462
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 have to use up

1463
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 God's wisdom.

1464
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 After using to the limit,

1465
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
 we have to open our minds

1466
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
 with confidence

1467
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 in this supernatural

1468
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 realm to accept God's

1469
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
 inspiration.

1470
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
 God's infinite wisdom

1471
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
 limits our understanding of God.

1472
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 God may want to

1473
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 show us the whole

1474
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
 light.

1475
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
 If we wear colored glasses,

1476
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
 we can only see a part of it.

1477
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 This is our rationality that limits us.

1478
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 So we have to open ourselves

1479
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
 to see everything.

1480
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
 Do not rationalize it like a partition

1481
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
 between God and us.

1482
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 I just talked about faith.

1483
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
 The faith we talked about

1484
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 is the ability of people

1485
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 to believe and not to believe.

1486
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
 The faith we talked about

1487
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 is not a student telling his mother

1488
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 that he is very hard-working in studying

1489
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 and has confidence in his exam.

1490
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 Our faith has three

1491
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 points.

1492
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 Our faith

1493
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 is limited to our faith in God

1494
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
 and

1495
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
 God's words,

1496
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 which is God's inspiration.

1497
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 This is limited to this part.

1498
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
 Our faith is in rationality.

1499
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
 We have to understand

1500
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 that we have to believe in

1501
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
 the part that is beyond rationality.

1502
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 After we understand

1503
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 God's words,

1504
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
 we have to

1505
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
 obey

1506
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
 and turn God's words

1507
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
 into the power of life change

1508
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
 to change our lives.

1509
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
 Because faith is infinite.

1510
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
 So the faith and repentance

1511
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
 are two sides of a coin.

1512
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 Sometimes God calls us to repent

1513
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 and we see heaven.

1514
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
 God says faith is eternal.

1515
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
 Faith and repentance

1516
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 are two sides of a coin.

1517
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
 It is the same meaning

1518
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 that eternal life and seeing heaven.

1519
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 The third point of faith

1520
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 is that our faith

1521
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 is based on God's faith.

1522
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
 I believe in God's words.

1523
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 I have to understand

1524
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 and obey God's words.

1525
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 The most important thing is that I believe

1526
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 not by my ability,

1527
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 not by how much I can believe

1528
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
 and how much you can believe.

1529
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
 It doesn't matter if we believe or not.

1530
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 God is also faithful.

1531
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 So we put our faith

1532
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 in God's faith

1533
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
 because God's faith is unchanging.

1534
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 So the Bible tells us

1535
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
 that when God

1536
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
 gives His word,

1537
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 He is holding it

1538
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
 to give His word.

1539
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
 Because you and I are not reliable.

1540
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 Only God is reliable.

1541
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
 In the whole gospel,

1542
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
 only God is faithful.

1543
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 He can speak

1544
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 and do things.

1545
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 He is unchanging.

1546
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 His faith is unchanging.

1547
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 So our faith

1548
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 is based on God's faith,

1549
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 not our ability to believe.

1550
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
 We don't believe at all.

1551
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
 We feel it will change.

1552
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 But God's faith is unchanging.

1553
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 I just said that

1554
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 the general revelation is related to the universe.

1555
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 I won't talk about it here.

1556
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
 The special revelation is that

1557
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 God is holding the Bible

1558
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 and Jesus Christ

1559
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 to be born.

1560
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 This is a belief based on evidence.

1561
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 There are different people

1562
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 in the religious community

1563
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
 who have done different statistics

1564
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
 on the meaning of the Bible

1565
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
 and have already accepted a part of it.

1566
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 One of the things

1567
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 that I have calculated

1568
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 is that there are

1569
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
 about 2,500 languages in the Bible.

1570
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 Some count

1571
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 more than 1,800 languages.

1572
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
 I use this calculation

1573
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
 to say that there are

1574
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
 about 2,500 languages,

1575
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 and more than 2,000 of them

1576
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
 have already been born.

1577
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 So our faith

1578
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
 is not based on estimates.

1579
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 We are based on God's words

1580
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 and God's faith.

1581
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 Because God

1582
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 tells us that

1583
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 whether we agree or disagree

1584
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 in education,

1585
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 whatever God says will happen.

1586
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
 So in the book of Genesis,

1587
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 God says, "I have told you

1588
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
 from the beginning of the world,

1589
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 from ancient times to the end of the world,

1590
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 that my plan

1591
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
 must be established,

1592
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 that I must achieve

1593
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 what I have set out to do.

1594
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not.

1595
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 God will do what He says."

1596
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
 This is the foundation of our faith,

1597
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 the faith of God.

1598
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 God does not rely on people

1599
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 to find Him.

1600
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 God Himself

1601
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
 shows Himself.

1602
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 How does He show Himself?

1603
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
 He chose Israel

1604
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 as His teaching tool.

1605
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
 He chose a nation,

1606
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
 told it's words to this nation,

1607
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
 and then led this nation

1608
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 to be glorified by the whole world.

1609
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 His goal is to show

1610
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 people,

1611
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 to let people know that He is the only God,

1612
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 and no other gods.

1613
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 He emphasizes that

1614
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 He chose Israel

1615
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 because it is His sovereignty.

1616
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 So you don't need to ask

1617
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 why He chose Israel.

1618
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
 God says, "Because it is My sovereignty,

1619
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 it is My choice."

1620
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 God chose people

1621
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 for the purpose of

1622
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
 telling us

1623
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 about the creation of God,

1624
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 blessing and help

1625
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 in front of us.

1626
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
 If we listen to God,

1627
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 we will be blessed

1628
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 by the revelation of

1629
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 the good and righteous justice of God.

1630
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 If we don't listen to God,

1631
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
 we will be deceived.

1632
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 There are three important messages

1633
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 in the Bible.

1634
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 First, I talked about God's creation,

1635
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 then the fall of man,

1636
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
 the punishment,

1637
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 and the salvation.

1638
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 I will not go into too much detail

1639
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
 about the Bible,

1640
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 about sin and salvation.

1641
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 Today I mainly want to talk about

1642
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
 how the Bible proves

1643
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
 that God's existence is not based on science,

1644
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 but the Bible itself,

1645
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 God's own judgment.

1646
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
 I mentioned the source of sin,

1647
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 so I won't spend too much time on it.

1648
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 The most important thing I want to say is

1649
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 that God solves the problem of human sin.

1650
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
 You and I are both sinners.

1651
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 But it doesn't matter if you are comfortable or not.

1652
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
 God told us that we are sinners.

1653
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 Because you and I know how to lie since childhood,

1654
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 we don't need anyone to teach us.

1655
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
 We even lie to the point

1656
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 that we have no concept of sin.

1657
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
 We don't feel ashamed.

1658
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 The sin of man is not just the sin of action.

1659
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 Jesus Christ explains that

1660
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 when you hate someone,

1661
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 you commit a murder.

1662
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 You are guilty of the first crime,

1663
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 which is to kill someone.

1664
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 You are guilty of the second crime,

1665
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
 which is to kill someone.

1666
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
 The first crime starts from the heart.

1667
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 I hate someone,

1668
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
 maybe I don't dare to kill him

1669
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
 because I don't want to go to jail

1670
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 or I can't beat him.

1671
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 I hate someone for a lifetime,

1672
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
 I hate someone for a lifetime.

1673
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
 I have a guilty conscience against others,

1674
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 I have committed a crime.

1675
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
 Jesus Christ said that

1676
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
 the heart is the starting point,

1677
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
 the heart of God.

1678
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 So each of us is a sinner

1679
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
 but God is just and loving.

1680
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 God said that

1681
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 no sin will be judged,

1682
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
 but God did not kill anyone.

1683
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
 So God arranged

1684
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 a redemption for us.

1685
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
 He said that

1686
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
 even if you kill someone,

1687
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 you have committed a sin,

1688
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 and you have to be punished by God.

1689
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
 But God gave us a grace

1690
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 that we can be clean

1691
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
 by following Jesus' old ways.

1692
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
 How to do it?

1693
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 We can't be atonement for ourselves.

1694
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 God sent his only son,

1695
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
 Jesus Christ,

1696
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
 a man without sin,

1697
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
 a man who has the same flesh

1698
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
 as you and me,

1699
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
 who has been tested and has not committed a crime,

1700
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
 to become a redemption,

1701
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
 a sacrifice,

1702
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
 a salvation,

1703
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
 a high-quality

1704
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
 without sin,

1705
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 a high-quality without inferiority.

1706
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 He used this atonement

1707
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
 to atone for others.

1708
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 He ate the blood of Jesus,

1709
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
 shed the blood,

1710
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
 and covered the sins of others.

1711
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 As long as people believe

1712
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
 in the God Jesus Christ

1713
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 as their Savior,

1714
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
 they can be called righteous.

1715
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
 This is the reason why

1716
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
 the Bible says "to be clean by faith".

1717
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
 The reason is that

1718
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
 you and I are not good people,

1719
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 we are bad people, we are sinners.

1720
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
 But when we go to the cross,

1721
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
 Jesus died for us.

1722
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
 We admit Jesus,

1723
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
 we admit that we are sinners,

1724
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
 we admit that Jesus is our Savior,

1725
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 and we accept his salvation.

1726
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
 This means that we add our sins

1727
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
 to Jesus Christ,

1728
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
 and die on the cross for us.

1729
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
 At the same time,

1730
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
 Jesus is the only one

1731
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
 who is a man of the Holy Spirit.

1732
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
 He added his sins

1733
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
 to us like a garment,

1734
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 and covered us

1735
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
 with his blood.

1736
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
 He covered our shame

1737
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
 and made us

1738
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
 sinners as innocent people.

1739
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
 This is the reason why

1740
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
 we should be clean by faith.

1741
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
 So the most important thing

1742
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
 is that the Bible says

1743
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
 that this Savior,

1744
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
 who created you and me,

1745
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
 not only created you and me,

1746
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
 but also made you

1747
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
 and me into human beings.

1748
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
 So God loves the world,

1749
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
 and even bestowed

1750
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
 his only begotten Son to us.

1751
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
 Let us believe in him,

1752
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
 not to die, but to be eternal.

1753
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
 This is God's love for us.

1754
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
 The salvation of God

1755
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
 is completely the same

1756
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
 from the beginning of the world

1757
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
 to the end of the world.

1758
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
 When Noah committed a crime,

1759
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
 God had already said

1760
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
 that the offspring of a woman

1761
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
 in the future

1762
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
 is Jesus Christ.

1763
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
 Because Jesus Christ is a holy man,

1764
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
 he has no male father.

1765
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 The offspring of a woman

1766
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
 in the future

1767
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
 is his foster father,

1768
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 not his biological father.

1769
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
 He is a holy man,

1770
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
 so the woman is Jesus Christ.

1771
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
 When God wanted to

1772
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
 drive Adam and Eve

1773
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
 away from Eden,

1774
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
 God killed an animal

1775
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
 for Adam and Eve,

1776
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
 a bloodthirsty swine,

1777
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
 to make a leather

1778
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
 for Adam and Eve.

1779
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 This leather is to cover

1780
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
 Adam and Eve's shame

1781
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
 from the crime,

1782
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
 to foretell the future.

1783
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
 In the Bible,

1784
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
 "The man will repent of his sin,

1785
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
 and our sin will be added to

1786
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
 Jesus Christ, not our own sin."

1787
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
 Jesus Christ is like a wedding gown

1788
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
 to cover our shame.

1789
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
 This is the meaning.

1790
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
 There are more than 300 languages

1791
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
 in the Bible

1792
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
 that are related to Jesus.

1793
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
 For example,

1794
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
 in the 600s and 700s

1795
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
 before the communion,

1796
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
 it was said that he was

1797
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
 born of a woman,

1798
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
 born in Bethlehem.

1799
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
 In the book of Isaiah 53,

1800
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 there are many detailed descriptions

1801
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 of Jesus Christ.

1802
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
 He will be despised,

1803
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
 he will suffer a lot,

1804
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
 he will be oppressed

1805
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
 and we will be safe.

1806
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
 Because of his oppression,

1807
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
 we will be saved.

1808
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
 He was a criminal,

1809
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
 he was oppressed,

1810
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
 he was buried,

1811
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
 he became a prisoner,

1812
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
 and so on.

1813
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
 In the Bible,

1814
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
 in the book of Matthew,

1815
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
 this Savior came

1816
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
 and asked us to repent.

1817
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
 He has two reasons.

1818
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
 He wants to

1819
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
 collect the

1820
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
 useless fire

1821
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
 and burn it.

1822
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
 It means that

1823
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
 he came to save us

1824
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 and then to judge us.

1825
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
 Jesus Christ came twice.

1826
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
 The first time was the cross

1827
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 to save humanity.

1828
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
 The second time was the judgment.

1829
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
 He gave us a chance to repent.

1830
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
 So when people want to

1831
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
 have a miracle,

1832
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 to see,

1833
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
 to have a wisdom,

1834
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 to understand God's solution

1835
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
 to human sin,

1836
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
 there is no mercy.

1837
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
 There is only a cross.

1838
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
 This cross represents God's salvation,

1839
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
 God's love for humanity,

1840
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
 forgiveness and grace.

1841
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
 It represents the death of the world

1842
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
 and the resurrection of the world.

1843
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
 The resurrection is the

1844
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
 certainty of eternal life.

1845
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
 So Jesus Christ is resurrected.

1846
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
 This represents love.

1847
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
 The Bible also mentions

1848
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
 that it is rare for people

1849
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
 to die for others.

1850
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
 Some people die for others,

1851
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
 some for others.

1852
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
 But Jesus Christ died for us

1853
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 when we were sinners.

1854
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
 God's love

1855
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
 is manifested to us again.

1856
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
 Today we are sinning against God.

1857
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
 God loves us.

1858
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
 He speaks to us in tongues

1859
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
 and asks us to repent.

1860
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
 This is God's love.

1861
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 So the cross represents

1862
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
 God's salvation,

1863
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
 God's wisdom,

1864
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
 God's mercy,

1865
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
 Jesus Christ himself

1866
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
 suffered all the evil of human sin

1867
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
 and suffered alone

1868
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
 to save us.

1869
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
 What is faith?

1870
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
 I just explained

1871
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
 the object of faith,

1872
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
 the characteristics and the basis of faith.

1873
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
 In the Bible,

1874
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
 there are two more things to mention.

1875
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
 First, the grasp of the judgment,

1876
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
 the proof of the truth

1877
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
 of the truth of the cross.

1878
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
 If we look at this chart,

1879
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
 we are here

1880
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
 in the year of our life.

1881
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
 We are here now.

1882
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
 People's eyes

1883
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
 can only see

1884
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
 what is in front of their eyes.

1885
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
 We don't know what will happen

1886
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
 tomorrow.

1887
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
 But the eyes of faith

1888
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
 can transcend time and space.

1889
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
 Because our faith

1890
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
 is based on God's words

1891
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
 and God's truth.

1892
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
 What is the unseen thing?

1893
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
 What is the unseen thing?

1894
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
 From the beginning of the world,

1895
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
 the Bible tells us

1896
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
 how God created

1897
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
 and how he led

1898
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
 the Israelites

1899
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
 to spread the word of God

1900
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
 to the whole world.

1901
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
 All the prophecies

1902
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
 that have already happened

1903
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
 have not been seen by us.

1904
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
 But we believe

1905
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
 they are God's words.

1906
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 There are still many

1907
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
 unfulfilled prophecies

1908
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
 that are

1909
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
 something we are looking forward to.

1910
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
 For example, Jesus will come back to judge.

1911
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
 We know that

1912
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
 he will come back

1913
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
 based on God's truth.

1914
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
 So this faith

1915
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 is beyond time and space.

1916
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
 I want to emphasize

1917
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
 that this faith is not

1918
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
 what you and I believe.

1919
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
 Our faith is based on God's words.

1920
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
 God's words and God's words.

1921
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
 The foundation is God's truth.

1922
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
 What God says

1923
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
 has nothing to do with our belief.

1924
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
 What he says will definitely happen.

1925
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
 So what has already happened,

1926
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
 although I am not there,

1927
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
 I believe.

1928
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
 So based on the eyes of faith,

1929
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
 it is beyond time and space.

1930
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
 Because of this reason,

1931
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
 Hebert Rice said

1932
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
 a very important thing.

1933
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
 We understand that

1934
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
 the universe is created by God's words.

1935
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
 This is the point.

1936
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
 The point of the Big Bang.

1937
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
 It really has a Big Bang.

1938
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
 Scientists can't explain it

1939
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
 because of physics.

1940
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
 But because of faith,

1941
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
 we know that God created it.

1942
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
 This is what

1943
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
 can be seen by the eye

1944
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
 is created from what can't be seen.

1945
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
 The universe that can be seen

1946
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
 is created from the God

1947
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
 that can't be seen.

1948
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
 The matter that can be seen

1949
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
 is created from the energy

1950
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
 that can't be seen.

1951
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
 Because of faith,

1952
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
 we see very broadly.

1953
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
 Beyond time and space,

1954
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
 we have to understand a lot.

1955
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
 I don't need to be there.

1956
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
 I know because God told me.

1957
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
 And what God said will definitely happen.

1958
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
 We have to believe.

1959
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
 So our faith is much bigger

1960
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
 than people's rationality.

1961
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
 All God's work

1962
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
 is in the part of super rationality.

1963
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
 All God's work is in this part.

1964
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
 If we just keep ourselves in this part,

1965
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
 we will never see God's greatness.

1966
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
 Abraham

1967
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
 we call him the father of faith.

1968
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
 The God and his

1969
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
 herds

1970
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
 can't be seen in the whole life.

1971
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
 The God told him

1972
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
 "The herds of the people

1973
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
 are blessed because of you."

1974
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
 This "herds" refers to Jesus Christ,

1975
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
 the Savior.

1976
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
 He appeared in the

1977
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
 2,000 years of the cross.

1978
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
 He can't be seen in the flesh.

1979
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
 What did Jesus say?

1980
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
 He said in the Gospel of John,

1981
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
 "Abraham rejoiced

1982
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
 and looked up at the days

1983
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
 when he saw joy."

1984
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
 How did he see?

1985
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
 His faith is the spiritual vision.

1986
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
 We believe God's words.

1987
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
 So when God speaks, I believe.

1988
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
 So Abraham

1989
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
 looked up

1990
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
 and saw the Savior.

1991
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
 Although he couldn't see him

1992
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
 in the flesh,

1993
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
 he saw him with faith.

1994
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
 His national land

1995
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
 was built.

1996
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
 When the nation

1997
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
 was in the Jerusalem,

1998
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
 he was no longer in the world.

1999
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
 He had faith.

2000
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
 He believed God.

2001
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
 This is the reason why he had faith.

2002
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
 The Bible says

2003
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
 faith is beyond time.

2004
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
 The faith we talk about

2005
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
 is not what you and I think.

2006
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
 It is God's word.

2007
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
 It is God's word and the faith based on God.

2008
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
 One thing is very important.

2009
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
 It is the resurrection of Christ.

2010
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
 We have never seen it.

2011
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
 Neither have you and I.

2012
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
 The resurrection of Christ.

2013
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
 The Bible says

2014
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
 the resurrection of Christ.

2015
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
 Who was Paul?

2016
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
 Paul was the leader

2017
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
 who led people

2018
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
 to persecute the Christians.

2019
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
 Until the resurrection of Christ,

2020
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
 Paul was the only one

2021
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
 who was resurrected.

2022
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
 Paul was the only one

2023
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
 who was resurrected.

2024
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
 Paul said in the Bible

2025
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
 I have been faithful and have given you

2026
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
 the most important thing.

2027
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
 The most important thing is

2028
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
 that Christ is as recorded in the Bible.

2029
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
 It is not what people say.

2030
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
 It is as recorded in the Bible.

2031
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
 It was said in the Bible.

2032
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
 He died for our sins.

2033
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
 He was buried.

2034
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
 It is as recorded in the Bible.

2035
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
 He was resurrected in three days.

2036
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
 We read it in the Old and New Testament.

2037
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
 Jesus Christ predicted three times

2038
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
 that he would be killed and resurrected in three days.

2039
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
 Then he emphasized

2040
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
 that the resurrected Christ

2041
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
 would be Jesus Christ.

2042
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
 The 12 disciples

2043
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
 would appear.

2044
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
 The 12 disciples

2045
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
 would appear.

2046
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
 The 500 brothers would appear.

2047
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
 The son of Jesus would appear.

2048
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
 The disciples would appear.

2049
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
 The son of Jesus

2050
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
 would appear.

2051
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
 He was the least of the few.

2052
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
 He was the one who was disowned.

2053
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
 Many people

2054
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
 went to the temple to see

2055
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
 the 12 disciples.

2056
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
 Except John,

2057
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
 who wrote the book of Ephesians

2058
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
 and John's letter to John.

2059
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
 All the other disciples

2060
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
 were Christians.

2061
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
 One of the disciples

2062
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
 was called Thomas.

2063
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
 Thomas was also

2064
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
 a Christian.

2065
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
 Christianity has a very important meaning.

2066
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
 It is the Kingdom of Israel.

2067
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
 It was in 586 BC

2068
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
 which is equivalent to

2069
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
 the Spring and Autumn Period in China.

2070
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
 It is described in detail.

2071
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
 It is described in detail.

2072
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
 The Israelites were thrown

2073
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
 from heaven to earth.

2074
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
 They were driven to various countries

2075
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
 and humiliated.

2076
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
 They were separated in 2600

2077
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
 and in 1900.

2078
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
 They were separated in 2600 and in 1900.

2079
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
 It is mentioned in the Old Testament

2080
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
 that those who were exiled would return to their homeland.

2081
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
 There was no country in the world

2082
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
 that was able to

2083
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
 return to their homeland

2084
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
 after 2600 years.

2085
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
 There was no country in the world

2086
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
 that could return to their homeland

2087
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
 after 2600 years.

2088
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
 So, before 1948,

2089
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
 many people could still

2090
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
 laugh at the Bible.

2091
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
 After 1948,

2092
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
 we could not

2093
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
 laugh at the Bible.

2094
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
 Jesus Christ

2095
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
 resurrected.

2096
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
 Many believers

2097
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
 witnessed

2098
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
 the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

2099
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
 One of them was Thomas.

2100
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
 Jesus Christ resurrected

2101
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
 for the first time in the Gospels.

2102
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
 Thomas was not present at that time.

2103
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
 When the other Gospels told him,

2104
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
 he said, "Unless I personally

2105
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
 touch the nails of Jesus,

2106
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
 I will be saved."

2107
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
 When Jesus Christ was resurrected for the second time,

2108
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
 he asked Thomas to touch his wounds.

2109
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
 Thomas knelt down

2110
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
 and told Jesus,

2111
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
 "My Lord, my God."

2112
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
 Why?

2113
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
 Because Thomas no longer used his limited

2114
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
 human wisdom to block

2115
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
 God's revelation.

2116
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
 He understood that Jesus Christ was God.

2117
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
 Jesus Christ then told him,

2118
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
 "You see me and believe,

2119
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
 but those who do not see and believe

2120
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
 have the good news."

2121
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
 "What kind of people are these?"

2122
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
 Jesus Christ said,

2123
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
 "Jesus Christ told us

2124
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
 that we were not there

2125
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
 when Jesus Christ was resurrected.

2126
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
 Jesus Christ told

2127
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
 those who did not see

2128
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
 and believed

2129
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
 that Thomas was there.

2130
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
 You believe me,

2131
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
 and you have the good news."

2132
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
 That's all for today.

2133
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
 Thank you.

2134
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
 Take care.
