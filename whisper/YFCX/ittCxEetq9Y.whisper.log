[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.200]   I can sleep until 2 or 3 am
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.860]   I use this retaliation tool to treat myself
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.520]   I don't know if you have the same feeling
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.800]   It's exactly because I see my own work is so hard
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.640]   I really want to use this tool to reduce the stress
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.180]   The insomnia brought by this tool is to bring some compensation to my soul
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.020]   I don't know if you have experienced this kind of life
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.360]   We are so tired that we can only pay attention to our own stress
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.060]   We use the tool to satisfy ourselves
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.860]   Although we read the Bible every day
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.460]   But we seem to not see or experience God's compassion
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.340]   Not experiencing his understanding
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.840]   The title of today's lecture is "Come and See"
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.500]   I want to use the story of the trumpet leaf being called
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.540]   To see how God lets people experience themselves
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.420]   The text is in the PowerPoint
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.680]   Let's read together
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.420]   1, 2, 3
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.680]   One day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.180]   He found Philae and said to her, "Follow me"
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.820]   Philae was the wife of Archbishop of Barsuch, and was from the town of Andalusia
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.240]   Philae found the trumpet leaf and said to her,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.080]   "What Moses wrote in the Law and what the ancestors wrote
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.540]   We have seen it, and it is the son of Joseph, the son of Nazareth, Jesus"
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.580]   The trumpet leaf said to her,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.620]   "Is Nazareth a good place to be?"
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.380]   Philae said, "You see"
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.760]   Jesus saw the trumpet leaf coming to her
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.600]   And said to her, "Look, this is a man of Israel
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   He has no evil in his heart"
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.700]   The trumpet leaf said to her,
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.160]   "How do you know me?"
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.140]   Jesus said to her,
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.580]   "Philae said, 'I have called you,
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.040]   and you are under the tree of the fruit of the woods,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.140]   and I have seen you'"
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.740]   The trumpet leaf said to her,
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.720]   "You are the son of God, and you are the king of Israel"
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.680]   Jesus said to her,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.620]   "Because I am under the tree and I have seen you,
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.760]   do you believe that you will see greater things than this?"
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.460]   She said, "I am telling you again
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.240]   that you will see the heaven opening
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.200]   and the messenger of God coming to the people"
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   Let us pray together
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.840]   God, we thank you for preparing our hearts,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.080]   our ears, and our eyes
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.060]   so that we can speak at this time
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.020]   so that we can see how you speak to us
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.860]   especially when you protect the mouth of the child
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.900]   When I preach,
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.660]   let us see how you lead us
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.540]   We thank you, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.540]   The background of today's story
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.980]   is the story that took place on the way to the Galilee
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.780]   According to John's record,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.320]   Jesus received two disciples,
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.920]   one was called Andrew and the other was Peter
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.220]   The next day,
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.060]   he called Philae
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.220]   and on the same day, he met with the trumpet leaf
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.400]   Who was the trumpet leaf?
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.700]   The trumpet leaf seemed to be a friend of Philae
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.500]   Philae had just decided to follow Jesus
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.540]   He said, "Follow me" and immediately followed
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.680]   Jesus
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.380]   He hurried to the trumpet leaf
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.820]   to tell him a good news
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.020]   that Philae had arrived
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.380]   Philae was a big news to the people at that time
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.160]   Because in the New Testament,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.520]   although the Jews had their own territory,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.500]   they did not have military power
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.860]   nor any real autonomy
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.100]   Under this pressure,
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.900]   everyone was looking forward to God's promise
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.360]   to execute the promise
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.140]   that God would send a mighty king to save them from the trap
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.580]   Generally, the Jews believed that the Savior
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.280]   would use military power
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.620]   to help the Israelites rebuild the long-term security of the land
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.320]   So it is not hard to imagine
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.620]   that when Philae was talking about his arrival,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.220]   he was very excited
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.160]   He wanted to tell the trumpet leaf the good news
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.460]   He also said it very clearly
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.460]   He said, "We have seen it. He is the son of Joseph,
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.800]   the son of Nazareth, Jesus"
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.200]   I wonder if we are all excited like this in the beginning
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.000]   Would we be so excited to tell others
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.780]   to witness how we experienced the love of God?
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.380]   How did the trumpet leaf respond?
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.020]   He said, "Nazareth?
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.460]   What else is there to tell?"
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.960]   Why did the trumpet leaf look down on Nazareth?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.700]   Did the place offend him?
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.640]   Today, Nazareth is a tourist attraction
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.800]   But it used to be a small village with no reputation
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.480]   on a small mountain in Galilee
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.380]   And the Bible also mentions
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.620]   where Nitzah was born
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.380]   She was born in Bethlehem
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.980]   Bethlehem is a fertile land with abundant food
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.520]   and close to Jerusalem, the political center
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.120]   She was the queen of David
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.320]   Nazareth is a poor and unpopular place
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.500]   How could she be the queen of Jerusalem?
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.400]   On the other hand, there is a story about the trumpet leaf
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.340]   Why did he not believe it?
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.240]   Because he was saved
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   He was saved
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.780]   By what?
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.900]   Because people in the past
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.580]   would sometimes live their lives under the name of savior
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.980]   They tried to overthrow the Roman regime
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.620]   but they often failed
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.280]   For Nazareth,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.620]   is this a message?
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.460]   Is this a news that deceives people's hopes?
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.860]   Yes, Nazareth's suspicion of the testimony of Philae
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.060]   or the fact that she has a bias
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.140]   or that she does not dare to hold on to the news of Nitzah
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.140]   But it seems that her suspicions are reasonable
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.240]   Because when faced with suspicion, Philae did not respond
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   She did not try to defend herself
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.720]   Her response was only three words
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.220]   She said, "You come and see"
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.520]   The original text is also three words
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.660]   Let me read it
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.500]   "Er ko kai ide"
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.700]   Yes
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.900]   "Come and see"
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.160]   It is really translated like this
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.040]   It is a word with two similar meanings
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.680]   If translated into Chinese, it is "Come and see"
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   What does it mean?
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.020]   In fact, Philae meant
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.180]   "I have no answer to your question, Nazareth"
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.520]   "Why don't you come and see for yourself?"
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.460]   "I will go with you"
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.900]   This reflects that Philae has 100% confidence
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.120]   Even if she has no absolute answer
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.760]   she still believes in Jesus who touched people's hearts
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.600]   She will personally respond to Nathaniel's question
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.940]   And Nathaniel really agreed
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.440]   He followed Philae to see Jesus
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.280]   to see if the Nazarethite is really coming to Cairo
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.720]   He probably did not expect that this journey would change his life
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.520]   Then he said, "Jesus saw Nathaniel walking over and he said to him,
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.820]   'Look, this man of Israel has no deceit in his heart'
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.560]   Nathaniel finally saw Jesus
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.760]   But it was unexpected that Jesus could
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.340]   express his true nature in front of everyone
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.340]   and praised him for being a man of Israel
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.040]   who has no deceit in his heart
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.380]   Here, you might think of the name "Israel"
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.780]   It comes from the Arabic word "Arabic"
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.280]   It is the one that is related to the Bible
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   The Arabs have used false names to describe Jesus
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.320]   They have lied to his brother, his father, and his uncle
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.700]   So here, he said that Nathaniel is an Israeli herald
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.940]   but he has no pre-existing deceit and fraud
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.700]   How can this be considered as a praise?
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.700]   Also, Jesus' praise is not a compliment
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.700]   If it is a compliment
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.700]   Nathaniel would not respond, "How do you know me?"
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.440]   For example, since I was a kid
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.940]   I have always liked to use my phone
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.940]   I would watch a lot of IG reels to see how people are taking care of their kids
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.940]   It turns out that encouraging babies is a lot of learning
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.940]   It turns out that the praise on the surface
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.940]   like saying that babies are good, babies are good, babies are great
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.940]   But it is not enough to encourage babies to put in the effort
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.940]   and say that babies are good, babies are great
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.940]   It is not enough to help them, but instead, it harms them
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   Such false praise will actually hinder the development and growth of babies
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.940]   What do I want to say?
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.940]   I want to say that Jesus' praise has a point
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.940]   It is a very important point
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.940]   God's praise to Nathaniel is not on the surface
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.940]   It is directly to his heart
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.940]   It is not a praise that he is a good person
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.940]   Or this is the virtue that Nathaniel has been working hard for his whole life
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.940]   It is the theme of his life
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.940]   At this moment, Nathaniel was very surprised
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.940]   Because Jesus really spoke the truth about his inner self
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:20.940]   Jesus and I have not met each other
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.940]   He knows me so well, and knows me so well
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.940]   Where do you know me from?
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.940]   Jesus replied, "When Philip has not called you yet,
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.940]   I saw you under the fig tree."
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.940]   What does it mean?
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.940]   What is Nathaniel doing under the fig tree?
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.940]   In tradition, the rabbis like to be under the tree
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.940]   because it is hot and there are trees
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.940]   to preach, to read the Bible, to think, and to pray
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.940]   Is Nathaniel the same?
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.940]   The Bible does not explain
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.940]   We do not know what happened
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.940]   But what we are certain of is that under the fig tree
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.940]   is a very important key
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.940]   This keyword, plus the context of the story
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.940]   can actually make Nathaniel surrender
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.940]   What is the key to this door?
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.940]   Or is this a secret between Nathaniel and the Almighty God?
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.940]   Only he and Nathaniel know
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.940]   Jesus is the son of God, and he is very powerful
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.940]   He knows where Nathaniel has been before
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.940]   He has knowledge of space and time
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.940]   But what is even more powerful is his vision
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.940]   that can change people's minds
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.940]   In fact, this passage emphasizes the vision
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.940]   You see there are three visions in the book of Hallelujah
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.940]   In fact, the whole passage has seven visions
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.940]   But this one has three
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.940]   All are about Jesus seeing Nathaniel
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.940]   Even before Nathaniel opened his mouth
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.940]   Jesus had seen him, recognized him
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:20.940]   Sisters, what does seeing God's face bring you today?
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.940]   Excitement? Surprised? Or unease?
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.940]   Maybe we think that our hearts are so dark
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.940]   I have been in the final turn of the Lord for so many years
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.940]   Jesus, my Lord, will you be disappointed?
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.940]   Will you dislike me? Will you be angry with me?
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.940]   Or, God, I am doing well now
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.940]   I have a job, a relationship, a friend, a family, everything is going well
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.940]   You and I are just right
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.940]   The church is still going on, the dedication is still there
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.940]   But what moved me before
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.940]   Don't let me see it again, I don't want to see it again
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.940]   I don't want to respond to you, God
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.940]   You'd better not find me, don't see me
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   It turns out that being seen by God
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.940]   seems to bring some uncertainty
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.940]   But we should know that seeing God
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.940]   is actually a more abundant meaning
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.940]   In the Old Testament, seeing God
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.940]   is related to the need of the persecutors
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.940]   and the meaning of salvation
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.940]   I remember last week we went to the church to train
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.940]   A React team leader took us to see a scripture
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   He said the 2nd chapter of the book of Ezekiel
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.940]   Brother brought us to see how God saved Moses
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.940]   He saved the whole Israeli people
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.940]   The whole plan was based on God seeing God in person
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.940]   Even in the book of Genesis
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.940]   If you remember, the man named Haggab
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.940]   He was an Egyptian priest
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.940]   He was driven away by Sarah
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.940]   God saw his suffering
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.940]   and allowed him to protect him
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.940]   God's grace moved Haggab
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.940]   and moved him to call Jehovah the God of seeing
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.940]   The React team brought me here to sing a song
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.940]   It's about seeing God
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.940]   I've never heard of it, but it's a good match
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.940]   You all know it, it's 139
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.940]   It says here, "My body is not yet formed
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.940]   Your eyes have long seen God
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.940]   Your days, my last day
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.940]   Are all in your hands, writing down your will
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.940]   How precious your thoughts are
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.940]   How abundant your prayers are"
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.940]   Can you see it?
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.940]   God's vision is not a cold, frozen system
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.940]   It's not a boss who gives people money
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.940]   That's right, God sees the evil that people do
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.940]   He will judge people according to justice
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.940]   But for us, God's people
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.940]   Our citizens
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.940]   God does not use fear to mislead us
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.940]   Instead, he uses his knowledge of superhuman
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.940]   and his insight into people
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.940]   to arrange the best for our beloved children
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.940]   He calls us to rely on him when he knows what to do
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.940]   It's like I mentioned my baby
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.940]   My son is learning to walk
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.940]   He hasn't walked yet
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.940]   I don't know if he can walk today
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.940]   He's good at holding things and moving them around
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.940]   Sometimes he's very naughty, playing with electric wires
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.940]   He's like a little baby
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.940]   My dad is always watching him work
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.940]   and checking if he's in danger
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.940]   He's very good at electric wires
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.940]   He can even pull out the cable
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.940]   and snap it off
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.940]   He's very scared
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.940]   My dad is observing him
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.940]   and checking if he's in danger
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.940]   What would he do in an emergency?
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.940]   He would run away, right?
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.940]   Would he let him touch him?
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.940]   Is God like this?
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.940]   He watches us work
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.940]   He protects us in an emergency
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.940]   and even runs away
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.940]   Sisters
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.940]   God's watching over us
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:15.940]   is a full of love and respect
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.940]   When Nathan went to Jesus
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.940]   He was wearing a lot of chains and suspicions
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.940]   and even disbelief
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.940]   Jesus did not give up on him
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.940]   Because God's watching over him
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.940]   is not a weakness
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.940]   On the contrary, God saw
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.940]   how Nathan
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.940]   even in this weakness
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.940]   still responded
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.940]   "Come and see"
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.940]   In the weakness
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.940]   he still responded
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.940]   "Come and see"
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.940]   Now, Nathan has experienced this hardship
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.940]   This knowledge
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.940]   this knowledge of transmission
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.940]   even shocked him to say
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.940]   "This man in front is Laban, the son of God, the king of Israel"
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.940]   Each of these sentiments is a huge amount
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.940]   It's like the question at the beginning
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.940]   "Is it possible that Nathan is a Nazarene?"
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.940]   has become unimportant
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.940]   Do we have anything that keeps us close to Jesus?
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.940]   Like Nathan, is there anything we don't understand?
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.940]   I encourage you, sisters
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.940]   to carry the question in your heart
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.940]   "Come and see"
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.940]   Take a look
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.940]   Because Jesus is calling us
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.940]   "Come and you will see"
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.940]   Go forward and take a look
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:43.940]   Test Jesus
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.940]   Open up your life
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.940]   to experience this faith of walking and seeing
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.940]   "Come and see"
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.940]   The story is almost at the end
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.940]   Jesus' response to Nathan
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.940]   is very encouraging
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.940]   He continues
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.940]   "For I say, because I saw you in the fruit of the fruitless fruit,
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.940]   you will see greater things than these
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.940]   He also said, I tell you,
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.940]   you will see the heaven opening,
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.940]   and the witness of God coming down on the Son of Man"
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.940]   What does this mean?
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.940]   What does greater things mean?
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.940]   What does heaven opening mean?
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.940]   What does the witness of God mean?
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.940]   Coming down on the Son of Man?
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.940]   Actually, Jesus is quoting an old scripture
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.940]   in the Old Testament
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.940]   When he was dreaming, he saw the sky ladder
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.940]   This is in the 28th chapter of the book of Genesis
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.940]   If you have time, you can take a look
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.940]   There is an image
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.940]   When he was dreaming, he saw the sky ladder
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.940]   The witness of God came down on the Son of Man
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.940]   After that, the Archon thought, "Wow, God is so powerful
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.940]   He is here, I didn't know that"
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.940]   He changed the place to Bethel
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.940]   which means the house of God
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.940]   Simply put, this dream is a powerful spiritual experience for the Archon
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.940]   It allows the Archon to experience the presence of God
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.940]   It is a blessing to the people on earth
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.940]   Jesus redrew this picture
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   But the description is a bit different
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.940]   Can you see it?
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.940]   One is a ladder, the other is a Son of Man
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.940]   The Son of Man, in the book of Genesis, is talking about Nehemiah
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.940]   Actually, it is talking about Jesus himself
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.940]   So the witness of God came down on Jesus
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:42.940]   Jesus used this example to prove that he is the one who is the witness of God
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.940]   He is the bridge between man and God
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.940]   If we use John's word, Jesus is the road
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.940]   In the Old Testament, God told the angel about the miracle
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.940]   Now, Nehemiah appears
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.940]   He is the ultimate miracle
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.940]   Jesus is the miracle
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.940]   The so-called "reincarnation"
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.940]   It means a new era has begun
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.940]   If we look at the Bible, the first thing we see is the image of Jesus
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.940]   The bigger thing is the signs of Jesus
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.940]   We are all familiar with the 5-2-2, the 5,000-man-servant, the water-changing wine, the resurrection of Lazarus
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.940]   All these seven signs are shown in John's Gospel
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.940]   Why did the author show it this way?
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.940]   He also combined the seven "I"s in Jesus' words
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.940]   You may have heard of "I am the food of life"
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.940]   We just talked about "I am the light of the world"
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.940]   We are all familiar with it
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.940]   The "I am" echoes the "I am" in the Old Testament
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.940]   "I am the food of life"
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.940]   It means Jesus is talking about his "divine nature"
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.940]   So what I want to say is
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.940]   We need to see what we can see
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.940]   How God, through his miracles and his words, tells people who he is
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.940]   Just like today, the 9th chapter
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.940]   The Bible already has seven different names for Jesus
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.940]   Can you see it?
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.940]   The word may be too small
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.940]   It says "Nahahwite"
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.940]   "Nahahwite" in the Bible
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.940]   "Jerusalemite"
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.940]   "Lazarus"
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.940]   "Lazarus" in the Bible
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.940]   "Jerusalemite"
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.940]   "Jerusalemite"
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.940]   The Bible is really powerful
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.940]   It already has so many names in the Old Testament
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.940]   But each name has a deeper meaning
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.940]   The door is still one and a half
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.940]   Perhaps Philip or Nathaniel knew that
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.940]   Jehoiachin was going to be raised up by the cross
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.940]   But I think they never thought
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.940]   The place of the raising up was not a political throne
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:56.940]   On the contrary, Jesus was going to be raised up by the cross
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.940]   God wanted to show the door of the cross to the people
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.940]   To show the meaning of each of the "cleansing"
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.940]   Because Jehoiachin wanted the reader to understand who Jesus was
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.940]   To understand the true meaning of "the door of the cross"
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:19.940]   In the past, the Gospels were in the city of Bethlehem
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.940]   In the New Testament, Christ lived among people like a scene
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.940]   Today, Christ is still living with us
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.940]   He still lives in us
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.940]   The Bible says, "Do you believe?"
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.940]   "You have to see the greater things"
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.940]   It turns out that "believing" is not our end
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.940]   We have to slowly pursue the greater things
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.940]   God has ordered us to experience Him more
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.940]   To see Him more, to see Him, to understand Him
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.940]   To experience His love
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.940]   I will share a story
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.940]   I remember once my wife and I went on a visit
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.940]   For some reason, the visit was already a milestone
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.940]   In other words, after visiting this time
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.940]   There should be no more chance to visit these families
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.940]   That night, God gave us a feeling
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.940]   Every time we visit a family
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.940]   We would like to pray and bless them
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.940]   We would like to ask God to take care of them and to protect them
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.940]   When we went to this visit
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.940]   We met this visitor
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.940]   She was a homeless woman who was homeless
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.940]   My wife and I prayed with her
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.940]   After praying, God touched us
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.940]   We asked her, "Do you believe in Jesus?"
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.940]   She didn't even think about it
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.940]   She said, "Yes, I do"
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   We asked, "Really?"
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.940]   "Yes"
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.940]   I was very careful at that time
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   Why?
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.940]   Because I thought that if I invited people to believe in Jesus
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.940]   They would eat lemons
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.940]   So I confirmed my wish
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.940]   But I didn't expect that this time
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.940]   I just responded to the touch
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.940]   I prayed with them
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.940]   And asked them if they wanted to believe in Jesus
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:13.940]   God arranged for my wife and I to go to the harvest together
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.940]   To witness the resurrection of the human soul
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.940]   She said she believed in Jesus
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.940]   We immediately prayed with her
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.940]   And helped her to find a suitable church
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.940]   To give her a suitable church
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.940]   I thought it was amazing
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:37.940]   After that, my wife and I debriefed with other church members
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   We realized that it was not us who brought this woman to face God
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:48.940]   It was God who brought this woman to face God
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.940]   To give her to me, my wife, and even the baby in her womb
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.940]   To witness her amazing work
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.940]   To let us witness the glory of God's work
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.940]   I realized more today
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.940]   God seemed to be telling us
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.940]   He was telling me
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.940]   God had blessed my family to serve Him
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:17.940]   I was looking for a way to go forward
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.940]   I was worried that my family and my service would be dragged down
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.940]   God saw through my needs
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.940]   Through this visit, He seemed to be telling me
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.940]   Adrian, don't look at your own limitations
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.940]   Look at me with confidence
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.940]   Respond to my love with love
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.940]   You and your family will soon see
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.940]   What I do in your lives
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:56.940]   Today, I pray to God
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.940]   I pray that God will help us to open the eyes of the Holy Spirit
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.940]   When we are willing, we can see more
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.940]   The Holy Spirit will help us
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.940]   Through the Bible, we can witness the Holy Spirit
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.940]   We can understand the truth and richness of the Holy Spirit
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.940]   I pray that God will help us
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.940]   to see God's presence in our lives
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.940]   to see God's glory in our difficulties
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.940]   to see God's work in our service
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:30.940]   Sister Ling, next Wednesday, March 5th
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.940]   is the Holy Fathers' Day
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.940]   It is the beginning of the Holy Father's Day
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.940]   Traditionally, the faithful will fast and pray
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.940]   to practice repentance and self-awakening
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.940]   until the day of resurrection
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.940]   Yes, we are very busy today
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.940]   We are so busy that we have no time
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.940]   We don't even have time to call Jesus
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.940]   It is really not easy
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.940]   But are we willing to
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.940]   in these 40 days of the Holy Fathers' Day
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.940]   to separate our eyes from the Holy Spirit?
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:06.940]   Will we learn not to only focus on our own busy schedule and pressure
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.940]   but also to learn how to practice self-awakening
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.940]   and to stop doing things
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.940]   I have heard people say something
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.940]   in these 40 days
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.940]   They say not to drink coffee or milk tea
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.940]   or not to sleep after 12 o'clock
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.940]   or not to use your phone before going to bed
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.940]   For me, I used to say
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.940]   not to do things that are a retaliation
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.940]   to put down our old habits
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.940]   and use our physical feelings
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.940]   to focus more
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:41.940]   and pay more attention to Jesus
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.940]   I would like to invite you to be quiet
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.940]   and to pray together
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.940]   We have a time to meditate
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:58.940]   (music)
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:04.940]   Today, let's see if we can recall
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.940]   the vision of Jesus
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:17.940]   That vision can go beyond the weakness in our hearts
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.940]   and reach our true nature
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.940]   God uses the eyes of His love
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.940]   to look at us, who are so fragile
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.940]   He doesn't want to scare us
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.940]   He wants us to feel His tenderness
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.940]   Are we willing to open up our lives
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.940]   to put down our old habits
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.940]   and weaknesses
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   and embrace Him?
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:03.940]   At the same time, we are thinking
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.940]   Today, we have been faithful for a while
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.940]   Do we have a deeper desire
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.940]   to know Jesus Christ?
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.940]   The Bible tells us
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.940]   that His name has many meanings
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.940]   It has deep, meaningful meanings
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.940]   that we may not have discovered yet
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.940]   Lord, open up our mouths of the Holy Spirit
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.940]   to help us
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.940]   Through the words of God
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.940]   Through our spiritual practice
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.940]   Through our worship
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.940]   Give our hearts to our Lord
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:49.940]   Let us pray together
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:55.940]   Lord Jesus, You are the God who can hear people's prayers
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.940]   Today, we may have different thoughts
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.940]   in front of you
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   We may not dare to look at you
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.940]   We may feel very helpless
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.940]   or we may not want to be so close to you
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.940]   But the Lord has given us the opportunity
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.940]   to look at you
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:20.940]   Through this vision
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:26.940]   we can see your warmth
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.940]   Lord, open up our eyes
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.940]   Open up our mouths of the Holy Spirit
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.940]   We also want to see
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.940]   the many difficulties in our lives
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.940]   that are actually filled with your beautiful words
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.940]   Sometimes, it may seem like wishful thinking
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.940]   But I know it's not
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:43.940]   It's a desire
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.940]   When you give us the power of your eyes
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.940]   we can see
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.940]   that there is another perspective
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   and this perspective is to fulfill your beautiful words
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.940]   Help us
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.940]   Open up our ears
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.940]   Open up our eyes
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.940]   to see that
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.940]   what you have given us is the best
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.940]   We are weak
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.940]   but we ask for your help
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.940]   We pray with our hearts
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.940]   to be able to
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.940]   serve you, Lord Jesus
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.940]   Amen
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.940]   Let's stand up together
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.940]   and sing "Let Yourself Go" again
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.940]   I hope this can be a prayer
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.940]   to the Lord Jesus
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:34.940]   Let yourself go
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.940]   I kneel and offer my life
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.940]   I dare not look at you
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.940]   I dare not see you
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.940]   I face the ground
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.940]   and discover myself
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.940]   My blood is boiling
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.940]   I have lost
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.940]   I have been through a lot
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.940]   With the power of my eyes
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.940]   Let yourself go
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.940]   I kneel and offer my life
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.940]   I dare not look at you
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.940]   I dare not see you
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.940]   I face the ground
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.940]   and discover myself
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.940]   My blood is boiling
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.940]   I have lost
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.940]   I have been through a lot
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.940]   With the power of my eyes
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.940]   I pray that you can teach me how to live
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.940]   I can hear you speak day and night
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.940]   You have inspired me
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.940]   I continue to seek and explore
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.940]   I pray that you can teach me how to live
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.940]   I look at myself
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   and seek you
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   I put my hands up
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.940]   and wait for you
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.940]   We let ourselves go
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.940]   We tell Jesus
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.940]   We humble ourselves before you
