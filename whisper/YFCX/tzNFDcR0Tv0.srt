30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,380
 (Cantonese)

31
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,860
 When a person needs to lose weight and keep fit

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,660
 he needs to eat too

33
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,620
 When he went out to eat with his friends

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,100
 what did everyone ask him for in the restaurant?

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,940
 One said, "Can I have a tofu wafer, please, with a cold flower tea"

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,620
 Another said, "Can I have a pork rice bowl with a cold milk tea"

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,980
 And another said, "Can I have a meaty noodle with a cup of tea"

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,300
 When you need to lose weight

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,540
 and control your calories

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,660
 and you want to scream out loud when they talk about food

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,460
 and you are tempted by many things

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,340
 you need to rely on your strong willpower

43
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,780
 to tell yourself, "No, I need to keep on losing weight"

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,060
 Then you tell your boss, "I want a chicken breast rice with corn juice

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,300
 but with rice, please, with hot water"

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,540
 I believe you are very deliberate when you say this

47
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,180
 because you have a goal to keep on doing it

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,540
 and you scream out loud to resist the temptation of food

49
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,540
 I think this is a story about how you need to lose weight and keep fit

50
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,460
 I also want to say that as Christians

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,380
 not only do you exercise

52
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,780
 but we also need to keep fit and exercise

53
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,180
 Today, we will look at the Bible in Genesis 1-21

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,180
 to see if there is anything in our faith life that we need to remind ourselves to persist

55
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,980
 so that we can turn around

56
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,780
 Let's read the Bible together

57
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,820
 Let's read together

58
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,540
 Ready, go

59
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,780
 "And the Lord said, 'What the Lord has done

60
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,340
 is more cunning than the harvest of the whole world.'

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,060
 And the woman said, 'What the Lord has done

62
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,820
 is more cunning than the harvest of the whole world.'

63
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,060
 And the woman said to the snake, 'We can eat the fruit of the tree in the garden,

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,060
 but the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.'

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,220
 And the Lord said, 'You cannot eat nor touch, lest you die.'

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,820
 And the snake said to the woman, 'You will not die,

67
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,060
 for the Lord knows that when you eat, your eyes will be opened,

68
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,700
 and you will know good and evil as the Lord does.'

69
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,460
 And the woman saw that the tree was good for eating,

70
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,660
 and it was pleasing to the eye,

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,860
 and it was pleasing to the eye,

72
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,020
 and it made men wise.

73
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,860
 So she plucked the fruit and ate it,

74
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,260
 and she gave it to her husband,

75
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,900
 and he also ate it.

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,060
 And their eyes were opened,

77
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,660
 and they knew that they were naked,

78
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:23,060
 and they plucked the fruit of the tree and made themselves naked.

79
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,180
 Then the wind rose,

80
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,140
 and the man and his wife heard the voice of the Lord coming and going in the garden,

81
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,660
 and they hid in the garden,

82
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,300
 and they hid from the Lord.

83
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,740
 And the Lord called out to the man,

84
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,420
 and he said to him, 'Where are you?'

85
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,460
 And he said, 'I hear your voice in the garden,

86
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,060
 and I am afraid,

87
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,500
 for I am naked,

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,660
 and I have hidden myself.'

89
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,580
 And the Lord said to him, 'Who told you that you were naked?

90
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,660
 You ate what was on the tree,

91
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,100
 and I told you not to eat.'

92
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,580
 And the man said, 'You are like the woman who was with me,

93
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,220
 and you ate what was on the tree,

94
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,860
 and I was scared.'

95
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,300
 And the Lord said to the woman,

96
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,340
 'How could you do such a thing?'

97
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,620
 And the woman said, 'Who told you that I was naked?'

98
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,820
 Let's pray together.

99
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
 Let's pray together.

100
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
 God, please help us.

101
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,660
 Through your words, we have received help and guidance.

102
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,460
 And we ask that the Holy Spirit moves in our hearts

103
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,940
 so that we can have concentration

104
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,540
 and understand what you want to say to us.

105
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,740
 Let's pray.

106
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,460
 Let's pray.

107
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,460
 In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

108
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,220
 Let's move on to the Bible.

109
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,020
 In the first to the fifth chapter of the Bible,

110
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,300
 it talks about the conversation between the serpent and the woman, Hawa.

111
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,460
 When we look at the fourth chapter,

112
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,500
 the serpent says to the woman,

113
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,140
 'You will not die.

114
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,740
 For God knows that when you eat,

115
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,140
 your eyes will open, and you will know good and evil like God.'

116
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:27,940
 The serpent wants to induce Adam and Hawa to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.

117
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,820
 But let's go back to the third chapter.

118
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,060
 In the second chapter, God has given them a command.

119
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,420
 God says, 'You cannot eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.

120
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,220
 You can eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil,

121
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,580
 but if you eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil,

122
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,500
 you will die.'

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 But the serpent tells the woman,

124
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,140
 'You will not die.'

125
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,220
 The serpent adds a character to the word,

126
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,220
 which is the word 'not' in Chinese,

127
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,020
 to describe God's words.

128
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,540
 God says, 'For God knows that when you eat,

129
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,100
 your eyes will open, and you will know good and evil like God.'

130
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,540
 God wants to induce people to doubt God's love for people

131
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,220
 and the meaning behind God's words.

132
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,820
 God wants people to think that God is selfish.

133
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,660
 He wants to make people not want to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.

134
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:32,100
 God wants to make people not want to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.

135
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
 God wants people to make people not want to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.

136
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,380
 We can see that the devil wants to provoke people to have a grudge against God.

137
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,140
 He wants people to doubt God's words and orders.

138
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,860
 He wants people to think, 'Why can't I eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil?'

139
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,140
 At this time, the devil has placed the seed of doubt in people's hearts.

140
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,620
 The serpent indeed induced the devil.

141
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,260
 Gradually, the devil no longer believed God's words

142
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,700
 or God's orders and intentions.

143
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,260
 He committed a crime.

144
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,660
 I think the sixth chapter talks about

145
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
 when the serpent induced the devil,

146
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,300
 he took action.

147
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,500
 He said, 'Then the woman saw the fruit of the tree of good and evil,

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,620
 which was very good,

149
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,340
 and could be used as food.'

150
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,660
 It was very beautiful and pleasing to the eyes.

151
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,500
 It was also very pleasant to the eyes and made people love it.

152
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 So the woman picked up the fruit and ate it.

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,700
 She gave it to her husband, Adam,

154
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,900
 who was with her.

155
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,100
 Let's look at the sixth chapter.

156
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,860
 'The woman saw the fruit of the tree of good and evil, which was very good,

157
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,660
 and could be used as food.'

158
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,980
 In the original text, it means 'the woman saw that it was good.'

159
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,580
 Do you remember what happened in the first two chapters of Genesis?

160
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,900
 God created the heavens and the earth.

161
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
 When God created the heavens and the earth,

162
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,700
 do you remember God created the birds in the sky,

163
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,580
 the stars, the sun, and so on?

164
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,580
 God also said, 'God saw that it was good.'

165
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,500
 The two sentences and the two descriptions are very similar.

166
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,980
 What is it about?

167
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,060
 It turns out that people want to be gods or to be their own masters.

168
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,060
 They want to decide what is good,

169
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,780
 what is good, and what is right.

170
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,540
 They think they should act according to their desires.

171
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
 Behind the scenes, she is hinting that

172
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,980
 the woman is doubting God.

173
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,100
 God said that the fruit of the tree of good and evil is bad for people.

174
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,460
 It will kill people after eating it.

175
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,260
 She thinks it is not true.

176
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,100
 It is not right.

177
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,460
 The fruit of the tree of good and evil should not be decided by God.

178
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,460
 It should be decided by people's standards,

179
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,020
 their will and desires.

180
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,380
 We can see that

181
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,580
 after Adam and Eve broke God's command,

182
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,580
 the consequences of the crime were immediate.

183
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,860
 It brought great destruction.

184
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,620
 In the Bible, it is explained to us that

185
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,860
 after Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of good and evil,

186
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,980
 there was great destruction.

187
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,820
 The destruction was caused by the relationship between people and God.

188
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,460
 We can see that after people ate the fruit of the tree of good and evil,

189
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,660
 they began to avoid God's face

190
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,300
 and fear God's voice.

191
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,940
 This caused a barrier between people and God.

192
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,980
 The relationship was broken.

193
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,020
 Before the crime, people were very close to God.

194
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,060
 They would meet in Eden.

195
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,660
 They would talk and talk.

196
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,940
 They enjoyed being in Eden.

197
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,620
 After the crime, they became estranged from God.

198
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,740
 Their relationship was broken.

199
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,580
 The crime also affected the relationship between people.

200
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,980
 Adam and Eve were in the crime.

201
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,140
 Adam once described Eve.

202
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,700
 He said, "Eve is the flesh of my flesh and bone."

203
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,460
 What is it?

204
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,940
 It is the flesh and bone.

205
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,140
 It is a very intimate relationship.

206
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,340
 He would never separate from her.

207
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,980
 He loved her very much.

208
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,500
 But after the crime, what did Adam say?

209
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,420
 In verse 12,

210
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,780
 "Nahum said, 'You are like the woman who was with me.

211
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,580
 She gave me the fruit of the tree,

212
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,940
 so I ate it.'"

213
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,060
 It is said that Adam began to shirk his responsibility.

214
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,540
 He accused Eve of being very dissatisfied with her.

215
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:32,500
 This is when people and people's relationship began to change and weaken after the crime.

216
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,260
 In the same way, people and themselves also changed.

217
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,980
 Before the crime, Adam and Eve were in the flesh.

218
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,620
 They did not feel ashamed.

219
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,140
 They were not affected by the crime.

220
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,980
 But in verse 7,

221
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,220
 after the crime,

222
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,780
 people and themselves also broke up.

223
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,900
 He said, "When they saw their flesh and bones, they hid."

224
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,860
 They realized that their flesh and bones were ashamed,

225
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,540
 and they felt uneasy and did not want to face themselves.

226
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,780
 Sisters,

227
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,740
 I think that after the crime,

228
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,260
 or after Adam and Eve experienced the crime,

229
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,460
 they understood one very important thing

230
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,820
 about the relationship between people, themselves, and God.

231
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,660
 They thought they could decide what was good and what was bad.

232
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,500
 But they realized that they had to create everything.

233
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,100
 God, who created everything, knew everything.

234
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,900
 He knew what was good for people.

235
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,180
 God told them not to eat the Nine Fruits of the Cross.

236
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,780
 In fact, it was to prevent the greatest destruction,

237
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,100
 whether it was for people, God, or themselves.

238
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,140
 God had a good intention behind the command of people.

239
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,820
 He wanted to do good for people.

240
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,180
 I think it's like when a teacher is a parent,

241
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,620
 or when you meet children,

242
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,940
 what would you tell them?

243
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,860
 Tell them not to play with fire,

244
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,940
 not to talk to strangers.

245
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,100
 I think it's not just about controlling flesh and blood,

246
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,020
 not allowing them to do anything.

247
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,820
 It's actually to protect children from being hurt.

248
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,580
 I don't want them to experience any horrible things.

249
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,180
 I'd like to tell you a story about a person.

250
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,980
 Imagine this is a scene.

251
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,420
 Imagine a person,

252
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,540
 when he goes to school,

253
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,460
 he tells a bad joke behind his classmates' back.

254
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,300
 If someone finds out,

255
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,260
 he'll be told a bad joke by others.

256
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,580
 I think when this happened,

257
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,980
 it destroyed his relationship with his friends and classmates.

258
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,380
 People no longer trust him.

259
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,980
 Or when he gets home,

260
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,500
 he wants to watch something romantic,

261
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,060
 whether it's a video of a 18+ person.

262
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,140
 I think he's afraid of being seen by his family.

263
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,140
 He's also afraid of being caught in some situation.

264
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,820
 Maybe he saw his history on his phone.

265
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,060
 "Why did you go on this website?"

266
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,780
 Maybe he's afraid of being known.

267
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,260
 He's afraid of being embarrassed.

268
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,420
 He knows he's done something wrong.

269
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,820
 He's afraid to face others,

270
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,500
 afraid to face himself.

271
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,380
 Or maybe he's late for home,

272
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,860
 he's late for his appointment.

273
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,020
 He's having fun with his friends,

274
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,180
 or he's busy with something.

275
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,980
 He didn't reply to his parents' messages.

276
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,780
 When he got home, his parents asked,

277
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,300
 "Why are you home so late?"

278
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,620
 "We're worried about your safety."

279
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,300
 "Your parents are so annoying. They're always in charge."

280
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,460
 Then he started to yell at his parents.

281
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,740
 I wonder if you've ever experienced arguing with your family.

282
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,380
 Arguing with your family is uncomfortable.

283
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,620
 When you get home, you're embarrassed.

284
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,180
 You look at your family like you're in a cold war.

285
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,260
 You're always feeling anxious.

286
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,500
 This is a situation where you're not in a good relationship with your family.

287
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,260
 I think if this is how a person lives,

288
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,540
 he can say whatever he wants to say.

289
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,740
 He can look into the eyes whenever he wants to see something bad.

290
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,140
 Or if a person is angry,

291
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,980
 angry, or upset,

292
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,380
 he can say something rude or yell at others.

293
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,020
 I think you can imagine that in this person's life,

294
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,340
 his interpersonal relationships will be ruined.

295
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,900
 I think people don't like him,

296
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,780
 and he doesn't like himself.

297
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,020
 He's living with his friends and family.

298
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,540
 Or if he's a Christian,

299
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,340
 he's a Christian,

300
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,900
 he'll feel guilty about his relationship with God.

301
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,500
 He'll do something that doesn't go with his heart.

302
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,940
 It turns out that sin will make people,

303
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,140
 themselves,

304
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,420
 others,

305
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,740
 and God

306
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,660
 break up.

307
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,300
 Let's go back to these three scenarios.

308
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,740
 Sometimes, in order to break up,

309
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,460
 God uses the Bible to remind us,

310
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,460
 to give us a guideline to face the situation.

311
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,740
 The Bible says,

312
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,100
 "Do not judge others."

313
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,700
 That is, do not criticize others,

314
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,580
 lest you be criticized.

315
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,020
 The Bible also reminds us to be ready for the punishment.

316
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,020
 When we face our family,

317
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,380
 as children,

318
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,020
 we should learn to obey God.

319
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,940
 It's about respecting our parents.

320
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,900
 The next time God reminds us,

321
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,460
 we should not criticize our parents.

322
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,620
 We should listen to their concerns.

323
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,420
 We should be patient and listen to them.

324
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,900
 We should listen to them with respect.

325
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,860
 What do I want to say here?

326
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,340
 I believe most of you have been in church for a long time.

327
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,860
 Maybe you've been in church since you were young,

328
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,620
 maybe you've been in church since you were in K1.

329
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,220
 You know a lot about the Bible,

330
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,420
 or you know a lot about God's commandments,

331
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,780
 reminders, and orders.

332
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,580
 I think when you read the Bible,

333
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,300
 you can easily and quickly respond to the teachers,

334
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,380
 to the preachers,

335
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,740
 and to what we should do.

336
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,220
 But I want to ask you,

337
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,100
 when you say these things,

338
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,660
 you know what they mean,

339
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,060
 but do you understand

340
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,500
 what God's will is

341
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,020
 when He gives us these commandments and words?

342
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,980
 Have you ever doubted it?

343
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,140
 "Yes, I think it's true."

344
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,020
 I think it's like when you compare yourself to people who don't believe in God.

345
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,620
 You think there are a lot of things you need to follow in Christianity.

346
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,620
 Like there are a lot of do's and don'ts.

347
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,340
 You're not satisfied with the requirements.

348
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,700
 You think people outside are more free.

349
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,260
 You have a lot of restrictions.

350
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,420
 But what I want to tell you today is

351
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,340
 that God's orders and commandments

352
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,820
 are actually God's good will.

353
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,140
 These orders and commandments are not just some cold do's and don'ts.

354
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,300
 They are not just something you have to follow.

355
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,820
 God's love for people is behind these orders and commandments.

356
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,500
 God wants to help us get rid of our sins and desires

357
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,260
 through the commandments and commandments.

358
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,540
 God wants to bring us a relationship with God,

359
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,220
 or destroy us with God, ourselves, and others.

360
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,300
 God wants to give us a rich life.

361
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,660
 But I believe this rich life is about

362
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,300
 a relationship with God, ourselves, and others.

363
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,420
 We humans tend to doubt a lot.

364
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,460
 We think God has given us a lot of harsh requirements.

365
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,060
 But it turns out that God's good will is behind it.

366
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,060
 God's good will is behind the commandments and commandments.

367
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,980
 God wants to remind us not to be influenced by our sins.

368
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,700
 So that when we understand God's good will,

369
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,940
 we can follow God's good will.

370
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:16,260
 So that we can experience a wonderful life with God and ourselves.

371
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,420
 Let's continue to look at the next part of the scripture.

372
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,540
 When we look at the scripture,

373
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,620
 when Eve committed a sin,

374
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,700
 she said her eyes were opened.

375
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,660
 She knew she was naked.

376
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,980
 When she was ashamed,

377
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,260
 in order to cover up her shame,

378
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
 what did she do first?

379
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,020
 In the seventh chapter, she said,

380
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,100
 "She made a garment of unripe fruit for herself,

381
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,660
 and made a dress for herself."

382
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,140
 As I mentioned,

383
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,620
 this is the third chapter of Genesis.

384
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,420
 The first and second chapters of Genesis

385
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,580
 talk about God's creation of the universe,

386
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,220
 the sun, the earth, and many other creatures.

387
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,740
 At that time, the word "creation"

388
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,860
 was often used to describe God's creation.

389
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,460
 God created something, and so on.

390
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
 In the seventh chapter of Genesis,

391
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,500
 it is the first time that people

392
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 started to use their own abilities

393
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,580
 to create things for themselves.

394
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,140
 This is the creation of a dress.

395
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,500
 Before Eve committed a sin,

396
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,300
 she relied on God's creation.

397
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,940
 God created the whole earth,

398
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,020
 the air, and everything else that they could enjoy.

399
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,540
 They didn't need to rely on themselves.

400
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,780
 It was a beautiful state.

401
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,820
 But after committing a sin,

402
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,980
 they started to rely on their own abilities

403
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,460
 to make some amulets.

404
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,940
 After committing a sin,

405
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,100
 they felt the shame in their lives,

406
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,500
 the fear and anxiety.

407
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,580
 They used their own methods to face it.

408
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,180
 But when Adam and Eve

409
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,180
 used the leaves of a fig tree

410
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,420
 to make a dress for themselves,

411
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,620
 did they feel the shame

412
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,940
 in their bodies?

413
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,100
 Or did they feel like they were not brave enough to wear it?

414
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,180
 I think you may feel that

415
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,220
 you can't cover your body completely.

416
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,460
 Even if you wear it,

417
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,860
 you may feel unsafe.

418
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,340
 You may feel uncomfortable.

419
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,580
 I think Adam and Eve tried their best

420
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,820
 to use their own abilities to make amulets.

421
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,940
 They used the leaves to make a dress

422
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,740
 to try to cover their feelings of insecurity and shame.

423
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,300
 But they found it was not very useful.

424
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,300
 They still felt a lot of shame.

425
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,180
 In the 8th episode,

426
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,140
 they immediately talked about it.

427
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,820
 When they found that what they did

428
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,020
 was not able to cover their own feelings of insecurity and shame,

429
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,180
 God came to Adam and Eve.

430
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,980
 God said in the 8th episode,

431
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,940
 Adam and Eve heard the voice of God walking in the garden.

432
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,500
 God called them.

433
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,660
 God called them and asked, "Where are you?"

434
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,420
 "Where are you?"

435
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,340
 I think God knew everything.

436
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,580
 When God asked them, "Where are you?"

437
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,900
 He did not mean that they did not know where Adam and Eve were.

438
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,420
 He wanted people to walk out

439
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,620
 and walk out and go back to their creator, their Lord.

440
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,820
 They repent and turn around

441
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,540
 and receive help.

442
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,860
 When people broke God's command and order,

443
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,620
 God did not give up on people.

444
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,740
 He was still very gentle and called people.

445
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,420
 This reflects God's love and concern for people.

446
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,380
 Indeed, when Adam and Eve broke God's command and order,

447
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,220
 they had to bear God's punishment.

448
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
 But when we pay attention,

449
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,260
 God never called people.

450
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,060
 Instead, God called the devil himself.

451
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,660
 In the 15th episode,

452
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,260
 when we read it,

453
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:20,580
 God provided a way to make up for the guilt and fear of people.

454
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,860
 In the 15th episode,

455
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,620
 God said, "I will make you and the woman be enemies."

456
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,500
 "The devil's descendants and the woman's descendants will be enemies."

457
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,660
 God said, "The devil will hurt your head."

458
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,580
 "You will hurt his legs."

459
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,860
 Let me explain what this means.

460
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,580
 The emphasis on the woman's descendants is very special.

461
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,060
 In the Bible,

462
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,340
 it is often mentioned in the name of the father

463
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,460
 who gives birth to whom.

464
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,700
 For example, do you remember who Abraham gave birth to?

465
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,380
 You don't remember?

466
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,660
 Isaac.

467
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,340
 Isaac gave birth to Isaac.

468
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:09,300
 In many cases, the Bible is arranged by the father.

469
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,340
 It is rarely mentioned about the woman's descendants.

470
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,180
 But in the Bible,

471
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,540
 there is a man who was born from a woman,

472
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,100
 not by the combination of men and women.

473
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,940
 Who is that?

474
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,620
 Yes, it is Jesus Christ who was born from a virgin.

475
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,540
 In the 3 chapters of Genesis,

476
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,660
 God knows that people are affected by sin.

477
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,020
 God has arranged a way to save people in the beginning.

478
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,340
 The way to save people is Jesus Christ.

479
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,500
 It is about the man who will hurt your head.

480
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,940
 Jesus Christ will overcome the devil.

481
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,220
 He will defeat the devil and save people from sin.

482
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,020
 He will restore a beautiful relationship between man and God.

483
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,300
 He will hurt the devil's heel.

484
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,500
 What does it mean?

485
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,700
 It means that Jesus Christ will suffer in this world.

486
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,420
 He will nail a cross on his feet.

487
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,180
 But the purpose of this is to save people.

488
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,340
 When people commit a crime,

489
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,660
 the crime destroys the beautiful life God gave them.

490
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,740
 When they face the guilt, shame and fear in their hearts,

491
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,500
 they want to rely on themselves.

492
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,140
 They want to use the leaf of the vine to make a way to save people.

493
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,900
 But when we compare the situation

494
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,460
 when people rely on their own ability, method and God,

495
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,860
 the situation is completely different.

496
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,700
 The fruitless leaf of the vine

497
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,380
 wants to cover their shame and anxiety.

498
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,140
 But it is too incomplete.

499
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,620
 It is too weak.

500
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,220
 It cannot help people to cover their fear and shame.

501
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,460
 It cannot restore the relationship between man and God.

502
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,740
 But the way God offers to save people

503
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,660
 is to allow Jesus Christ to save people.

504
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,980
 He helps us to overcome our sins

505
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,540
 and restore the relationship between God and man.

506
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,820
 In the 21st chapter of the Bible,

507
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,340
 God made a leather garment for people

508
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,780
 before they were forced to wear clothes.

509
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,020
 It is a proper garment.

510
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,180
 People can wear it to keep warm

511
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,580
 and to cover their body.

512
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:41,380
 The method and connection and grace God offers to people

513
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,180
 is very strong and safe.

514
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,940
 It can cover the shame and anxiety in people's hearts.

515
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,940
 Sister Ding, sometimes we want to rely on our own method

516
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,740
 to cover our fear, anxiety, guilt and shame in life.

517
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,340
 Have you ever experienced something in your life?

518
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,300
 Whether it is quarreling with friends or family,

519
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,940
 or you are very self-abased and don't like yourself,

520
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,860
 when something happens,

521
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,580
 do you feel like this?

522
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,820
 When people ask you, "How are you recently?"

523
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,900
 You say, "I'm okay."

524
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,180
 You pretend to be cool and nothing happens.

525
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,060
 Or do you sometimes fill your schedule

526
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,780
 so that you don't have to think about unhappy things?

527
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,300
 You may participate in more activities,

528
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,460
 hang out with more friends,

529
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,620
 use more cell phones,

530
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,700
 watch more videos on YouTube or look at more Instagram.

531
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,980
 Or is your method

532
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,300
 to make up for your failure?

533
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,900
 You want to improve your performance

534
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,500
 and increase your self-esteem.

535
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,460
 Sometimes when you do this,

536
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,700
 you may have some problems in your life

537
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,900
 that you don't know how to deal with.

538
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,180
 Or you may have a lot of anxiety and fear.

539
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,940
 You want to use these methods,

540
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,740
 whether it is to be busy,

541
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,660
 to satisfy yourself with some achievements,

542
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,620
 or to improve your sense of value and existence.

543
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,380
 Frankly speaking,

544
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,580
 as a translator,

545
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,300
 I sometimes do this.

546
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,500
 I want to avoid uncomfortable feelings

547
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,660
 and use my own methods.

548
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,100
 But have you noticed that when you use these methods,

549
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,460
 they only make you feel better in a short time?

550
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,940
 When you use achievements to prove your value,

551
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,900
 you will find that when the results rise and fall,

552
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,860
 your value will rise and fall with the results.

553
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,380
 I don't know if you are in the same situation.

554
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,980
 I want to share my story.

555
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,900
 Maybe you in China have never heard of my story of growing up.

556
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,460
 I grew up in a single-parent family.

557
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,540
 When I was in primary school, my parents divorced.

558
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,940
 Then my family, me, my mother and my brother,

559
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,500
 went to live with our own money.

560
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,260
 I remember that my life changed a lot

561
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,100
 after my parents divorced.

562
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,620
 I started to feel very uncomfortable and shy in my family.

563
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,220
 I think the most intense thing was

564
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,100
 when I was in primary school,

565
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,740
 I usually didn't know what to do after school.

566
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,660
 Maybe my friends and classmates would go to school to study.

567
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,060
 I would usually tell my classmates,

568
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,700
 "I'm going home."

569
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,100
 Because my family didn't have enough money to send me to school,

570
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,060
 or to send me to study.

571
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,020
 I wanted to study.

572
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,580
 During this process,

573
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,220
 every time I compared myself with my classmates,

574
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,500
 I would feel that my family was worse than others.

575
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,700
 I felt ashamed and insecure.

576
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,860
 What was my method at that time?

577
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,700
 I wanted to erase this feeling of unhappiness.

578
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,060
 I focused on studying, and I tried hard to study.

579
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,060
 I wanted to be a good student,

580
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,060
 to prove that I was worth it.

581
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
 I was okay.

582
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,660
 I wanted to cover up my shyness

583
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,700
 or the feeling of being inferior to others.

584
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,460
 But I found that when I got good grades,

585
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,060
 when I got good grades,

586
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,500
 my heart, my mood, and my value,

587
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,100
 my value of freedom would gradually decrease.

588
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,860
 I used to go to my friends' houses.

589
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,460
 They would say, "Come to my house to play."

590
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,900
 When I saw their houses,

591
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,660
 and compared them with my house,

592
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,460
 I would feel a sudden surge of unease and shyness.

593
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,780
 It was a feeling of uncertainty.

594
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,380
 I think when I was in high school,

595
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,780
 I started to have friends who took me to church.

596
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,500
 I think for me,

597
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,100
 to meet God, to understand God,

598
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,380
 and to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ,

599
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,300
 the biggest thing for me was

600
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,780
 I believe that God is unconditional love and acceptance.

601
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,300
 God is very clear.

602
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,380
 I know that He doesn't look at me based on my ability,

603
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,700
 He doesn't look at me based on my appearance,

604
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,580
 nor does He look at me based on my family background,

605
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,900
 or my family's growth.

606
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,700
 He doesn't look at me based on whether I did something wrong

607
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,780
 and how He loves me.

608
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,660
 He says, "No matter what I am,

609
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,620
 my most true self is accepted and forgiven."

610
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,060
 Sister Ling, when God went to look for Adam and Eve

611
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,860
 and called them,

612
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,940
 they were still wearing the garment of the tree of the fruitless fruit.

613
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,220
 They were wearing the uncertainty of life

614
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,780
 and the shame of their guilt towards God

615
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,540
 until they met God.

616
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,940
 But when they were so honest and true

617
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,860
 and went to meet God,

618
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,180
 when they admitted their needs and weaknesses,

619
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,820
 God finally

620
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,940
 helped them with their affection and their grace.

621
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,660
 He prepared a garment of the fruit of their guilt

622
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,260
 and a garment of their skin.

623
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,660
 I believe that God's love and affection

624
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:22,540
 erased the anxiety, shame and fear in their hearts.

625
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,420
 I don't know if you want to experience

626
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,660
 the grace God gave us.

627
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,220
 I would like to invite the worship team.

628
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,780
 Sister Ling,

629
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,380
 God has been looking for us.

630
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,620
 But sometimes we are like Adam and Eve.

631
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,900
 We hide ourselves and don't want to be found by God.

632
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,820
 But God is still calling us today.

633
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,540
 We can bring our life's problems,

634
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,700
 weaknesses and shame

635
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,460
 to God

636
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,980
 and receive God's help.

637
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,500
 I want us to rise up

638
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,740
 and write our response to God through this song.
