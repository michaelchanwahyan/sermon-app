 (Chinese)

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,200
 I can sleep until 2 or 3 am

36
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,860
 I use this retaliation tool to treat myself

37
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,520
 I don't know if you have the same feeling

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,800
 It's exactly because I see my own work is so hard

39
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,640
 I really want to use this tool to reduce the stress

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,180
 The insomnia brought by this tool is to bring some compensation to my soul

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,020
 I don't know if you have experienced this kind of life

42
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,360
 We are so tired that we can only pay attention to our own stress

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,060
 We use the tool to satisfy ourselves

44
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,860
 Although we read the Bible every day

45
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,460
 But we seem to not see or experience God's compassion

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,340
 Not experiencing his understanding

47
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,840
 The title of today's lecture is "Come and See"

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,500
 I want to use the story of the trumpet leaf being called

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,540
 To see how God lets people experience themselves

50
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,420
 The text is in the PowerPoint

51
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,680
 Let's read together

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,420
 1, 2, 3

53
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,680
 One day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,180
 He found Philae and said to her, "Follow me"

55
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,820
 Philae was the wife of Archbishop of Barsuch, and was from the town of Andalusia

56
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,240
 Philae found the trumpet leaf and said to her,

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,080
 "What Moses wrote in the Law and what the ancestors wrote

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,540
 We have seen it, and it is the son of Joseph, the son of Nazareth, Jesus"

59
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,580
 The trumpet leaf said to her,

60
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,620
 "Is Nazareth a good place to be?"

61
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,380
 Philae said, "You see"

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,760
 Jesus saw the trumpet leaf coming to her

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,600
 And said to her, "Look, this is a man of Israel

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
 He has no evil in his heart"

65
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,700
 The trumpet leaf said to her,

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,160
 "How do you know me?"

67
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,140
 Jesus said to her,

68
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,580
 "Philae said, 'I have called you,

69
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,040
 and you are under the tree of the fruit of the woods,

70
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,140
 and I have seen you'"

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,740
 The trumpet leaf said to her,

72
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,720
 "You are the son of God, and you are the king of Israel"

73
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,680
 Jesus said to her,

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,620
 "Because I am under the tree and I have seen you,

75
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,760
 do you believe that you will see greater things than this?"

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,460
 She said, "I am telling you again

77
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,240
 that you will see the heaven opening

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,200
 and the messenger of God coming to the people"

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
 Let us pray together

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,840
 God, we thank you for preparing our hearts,

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,080
 our ears, and our eyes

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,060
 so that we can speak at this time

83
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,020
 so that we can see how you speak to us

84
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,860
 especially when you protect the mouth of the child

85
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,900
 When I preach,

86
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,660
 let us see how you lead us

87
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,540
 We thank you, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen

88
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:23,540
 The background of today's story

89
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,980
 is the story that took place on the way to the Galilee

90
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,780
 According to John's record,

91
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,320
 Jesus received two disciples,

92
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,920
 one was called Andrew and the other was Peter

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,220
 The next day,

94
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,060
 he called Philae

95
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,220
 and on the same day, he met with the trumpet leaf

96
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,400
 Who was the trumpet leaf?

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,700
 The trumpet leaf seemed to be a friend of Philae

98
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,500
 Philae had just decided to follow Jesus

99
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,540
 He said, "Follow me" and immediately followed

100
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,680
 Jesus

101
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,380
 He hurried to the trumpet leaf

102
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,820
 to tell him a good news

103
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,020
 that Philae had arrived

104
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,380
 Philae was a big news to the people at that time

105
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,160
 Because in the New Testament,

106
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,520
 although the Jews had their own territory,

107
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,500
 they did not have military power

108
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,860
 nor any real autonomy

109
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,100
 Under this pressure,

110
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,900
 everyone was looking forward to God's promise

111
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,360
 to execute the promise

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,140
 that God would send a mighty king to save them from the trap

113
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,580
 Generally, the Jews believed that the Savior

114
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,280
 would use military power

115
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,620
 to help the Israelites rebuild the long-term security of the land

116
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,320
 So it is not hard to imagine

117
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,620
 that when Philae was talking about his arrival,

118
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,220
 he was very excited

119
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,160
 He wanted to tell the trumpet leaf the good news

120
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,460
 He also said it very clearly

121
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,460
 He said, "We have seen it. He is the son of Joseph,

122
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,800
 the son of Nazareth, Jesus"

123
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,200
 I wonder if we are all excited like this in the beginning

124
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
 Would we be so excited to tell others

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,780
 to witness how we experienced the love of God?

126
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,380
 How did the trumpet leaf respond?

127
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,020
 He said, "Nazareth?

128
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,460
 What else is there to tell?"

129
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,960
 Why did the trumpet leaf look down on Nazareth?

130
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,700
 Did the place offend him?

131
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,640
 Today, Nazareth is a tourist attraction

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,800
 But it used to be a small village with no reputation

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,480
 on a small mountain in Galilee

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,380
 And the Bible also mentions

135
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,620
 where Nitzah was born

136
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,380
 She was born in Bethlehem

137
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,980
 Bethlehem is a fertile land with abundant food

138
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,520
 and close to Jerusalem, the political center

139
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,120
 She was the queen of David

140
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,320
 Nazareth is a poor and unpopular place

141
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,500
 How could she be the queen of Jerusalem?

142
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,400
 On the other hand, there is a story about the trumpet leaf

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,340
 Why did he not believe it?

144
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,240
 Because he was saved

145
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
 He was saved

146
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,780
 By what?

147
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,900
 Because people in the past

148
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,580
 would sometimes live their lives under the name of savior

149
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,980
 They tried to overthrow the Roman regime

150
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,620
 but they often failed

151
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,280
 For Nazareth,

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,620
 is this a message?

153
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,460
 Is this a news that deceives people's hopes?

154
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,860
 Yes, Nazareth's suspicion of the testimony of Philae

155
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,060
 or the fact that she has a bias

156
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,140
 or that she does not dare to hold on to the news of Nitzah

157
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,140
 But it seems that her suspicions are reasonable

158
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,240
 Because when faced with suspicion, Philae did not respond

159
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,240
 She did not try to defend herself

160
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,720
 Her response was only three words

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,220
 She said, "You come and see"

162
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,520
 The original text is also three words

163
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,660
 Let me read it

164
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,500
 "Er ko kai ide"

165
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,700
 Yes

166
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,900
 "Come and see"

167
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,160
 It is really translated like this

168
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,040
 It is a word with two similar meanings

169
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,680
 If translated into Chinese, it is "Come and see"

170
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
 What does it mean?

171
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,020
 In fact, Philae meant

172
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,180
 "I have no answer to your question, Nazareth"

173
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,520
 "Why don't you come and see for yourself?"

174
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,460
 "I will go with you"

175
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,900
 This reflects that Philae has 100% confidence

176
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,120
 Even if she has no absolute answer

177
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,760
 she still believes in Jesus who touched people's hearts

178
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,600
 She will personally respond to Nathaniel's question

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,940
 And Nathaniel really agreed

180
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,440
 He followed Philae to see Jesus

181
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,280
 to see if the Nazarethite is really coming to Cairo

182
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,720
 He probably did not expect that this journey would change his life

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,520
 Then he said, "Jesus saw Nathaniel walking over and he said to him,

184
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,820
 'Look, this man of Israel has no deceit in his heart'

185
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,560
 Nathaniel finally saw Jesus

186
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,760
 But it was unexpected that Jesus could

187
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,340
 express his true nature in front of everyone

188
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,340
 and praised him for being a man of Israel

189
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,040
 who has no deceit in his heart

190
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,380
 Here, you might think of the name "Israel"

191
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,780
 It comes from the Arabic word "Arabic"

192
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,280
 It is the one that is related to the Bible

193
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,280
 The Arabs have used false names to describe Jesus

194
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,320
 They have lied to his brother, his father, and his uncle

195
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,700
 So here, he said that Nathaniel is an Israeli herald

196
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,940
 but he has no pre-existing deceit and fraud

197
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,700
 How can this be considered as a praise?

198
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,700
 Also, Jesus' praise is not a compliment

199
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
 If it is a compliment

200
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,700
 Nathaniel would not respond, "How do you know me?"

201
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,440
 For example, since I was a kid

202
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,940
 I have always liked to use my phone

203
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,940
 I would watch a lot of IG reels to see how people are taking care of their kids

204
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,940
 It turns out that encouraging babies is a lot of learning

205
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
 It turns out that the praise on the surface

206
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,940
 like saying that babies are good, babies are good, babies are great

207
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,940
 But it is not enough to encourage babies to put in the effort

208
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,940
 and say that babies are good, babies are great

209
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,940
 It is not enough to help them, but instead, it harms them

210
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:44,940
 Such false praise will actually hinder the development and growth of babies

211
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,940
 What do I want to say?

212
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,940
 I want to say that Jesus' praise has a point

213
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
 It is a very important point

214
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,940
 God's praise to Nathaniel is not on the surface

215
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
 It is directly to his heart

216
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,940
 It is not a praise that he is a good person

217
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,940
 Or this is the virtue that Nathaniel has been working hard for his whole life

218
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
 It is the theme of his life

219
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,940
 At this moment, Nathaniel was very surprised

220
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,940
 Because Jesus really spoke the truth about his inner self

221
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,940
 Jesus and I have not met each other

222
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,940
 He knows me so well, and knows me so well

223
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,940
 Where do you know me from?

224
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,940
 Jesus replied, "When Philip has not called you yet,

225
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,940
 I saw you under the fig tree."

226
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
 What does it mean?

227
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,940
 What is Nathaniel doing under the fig tree?

228
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,940
 In tradition, the rabbis like to be under the tree

229
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
 because it is hot and there are trees

230
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,940
 to preach, to read the Bible, to think, and to pray

231
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
 Is Nathaniel the same?

232
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,940
 The Bible does not explain

233
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,940
 We do not know what happened

234
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,940
 But what we are certain of is that under the fig tree

235
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,940
 is a very important key

236
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,940
 This keyword, plus the context of the story

237
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,940
 can actually make Nathaniel surrender

238
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,940
 What is the key to this door?

239
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,940
 Or is this a secret between Nathaniel and the Almighty God?

240
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,940
 Only he and Nathaniel know

241
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,940
 Jesus is the son of God, and he is very powerful

242
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,940
 He knows where Nathaniel has been before

243
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,940
 He has knowledge of space and time

244
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,940
 But what is even more powerful is his vision

245
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,940
 that can change people's minds

246
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,940
 In fact, this passage emphasizes the vision

247
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,940
 You see there are three visions in the book of Hallelujah

248
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,940
 In fact, the whole passage has seven visions

249
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,940
 But this one has three

250
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,940
 All are about Jesus seeing Nathaniel

251
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,940
 Even before Nathaniel opened his mouth

252
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,940
 Jesus had seen him, recognized him

253
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,940
 Sisters, what does seeing God's face bring you today?

254
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,940
 Excitement? Surprised? Or unease?

255
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,940
 Maybe we think that our hearts are so dark

256
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,940
 I have been in the final turn of the Lord for so many years

257
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,940
 Jesus, my Lord, will you be disappointed?

258
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,940
 Will you dislike me? Will you be angry with me?

259
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,940
 Or, God, I am doing well now

260
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,940
 I have a job, a relationship, a friend, a family, everything is going well

261
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,940
 You and I are just right

262
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,940
 The church is still going on, the dedication is still there

263
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,940
 But what moved me before

264
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
 Don't let me see it again, I don't want to see it again

265
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
 I don't want to respond to you, God

266
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,940
 You'd better not find me, don't see me

267
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,940
 It turns out that being seen by God

268
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
 seems to bring some uncertainty

269
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,940
 But we should know that seeing God

270
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,940
 is actually a more abundant meaning

271
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
 In the Old Testament, seeing God

272
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
 is related to the need of the persecutors

273
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,940
 and the meaning of salvation

274
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,940
 I remember last week we went to the church to train

275
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,940
 A React team leader took us to see a scripture

276
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
 He said the 2nd chapter of the book of Ezekiel

277
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,940
 Brother brought us to see how God saved Moses

278
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
 He saved the whole Israeli people

279
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,940
 The whole plan was based on God seeing God in person

280
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
 Even in the book of Genesis

281
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,940
 If you remember, the man named Haggab

282
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,940
 He was an Egyptian priest

283
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,940
 He was driven away by Sarah

284
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
 God saw his suffering

285
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
 and allowed him to protect him

286
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,940
 God's grace moved Haggab

287
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,940
 and moved him to call Jehovah the God of seeing

288
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,940
 The React team brought me here to sing a song

289
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
 It's about seeing God

290
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
 I've never heard of it, but it's a good match

291
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,940
 You all know it, it's 139

292
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,940
 It says here, "My body is not yet formed

293
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,940
 Your eyes have long seen God

294
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,940
 Your days, my last day

295
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,940
 Are all in your hands, writing down your will

296
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
 How precious your thoughts are

297
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,940
 How abundant your prayers are"

298
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,940
 Can you see it?

299
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,940
 God's vision is not a cold, frozen system

300
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,940
 It's not a boss who gives people money

301
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,940
 That's right, God sees the evil that people do

302
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,940
 He will judge people according to justice

303
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,940
 But for us, God's people

304
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
 Our citizens

305
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,940
 God does not use fear to mislead us

306
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,940
 Instead, he uses his knowledge of superhuman

307
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,940
 and his insight into people

308
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,940
 to arrange the best for our beloved children

309
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,940
 He calls us to rely on him when he knows what to do

310
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,940
 It's like I mentioned my baby

311
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,940
 My son is learning to walk

312
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
 He hasn't walked yet

313
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,940
 I don't know if he can walk today

314
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,940
 He's good at holding things and moving them around

315
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,940
 Sometimes he's very naughty, playing with electric wires

316
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,940
 He's like a little baby

317
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,940
 My dad is always watching him work

318
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
 and checking if he's in danger

319
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,940
 He's very good at electric wires

320
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
 He can even pull out the cable

321
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
 and snap it off

322
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
 He's very scared

323
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,940
 My dad is observing him

324
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
 and checking if he's in danger

325
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,940
 What would he do in an emergency?

326
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,940
 He would run away, right?

327
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,940
 Would he let him touch him?

328
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
 Is God like this?

329
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,940
 He watches us work

330
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,940
 He protects us in an emergency

331
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,940
 and even runs away

332
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,940
 Sisters

333
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
 God's watching over us

334
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,940
 is a full of love and respect

335
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,940
 When Nathan went to Jesus

336
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,940
 He was wearing a lot of chains and suspicions

337
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 and even disbelief

338
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
 Jesus did not give up on him

339
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,940
 Because God's watching over him

340
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,940
 is not a weakness

341
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
 On the contrary, God saw

342
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
 how Nathan

343
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,940
 even in this weakness

344
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,940
 still responded

345
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,940
 "Come and see"

346
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,940
 In the weakness

347
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,940
 he still responded

348
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,940
 "Come and see"

349
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,940
 Now, Nathan has experienced this hardship

350
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,940
 This knowledge

351
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
 this knowledge of transmission

352
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
 even shocked him to say

353
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,940
 "This man in front is Laban, the son of God, the king of Israel"

354
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,940
 Each of these sentiments is a huge amount

355
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,940
 It's like the question at the beginning

356
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
 "Is it possible that Nathan is a Nazarene?"

357
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,940
 has become unimportant

358
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,940
 Do we have anything that keeps us close to Jesus?

359
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,940
 Like Nathan, is there anything we don't understand?

360
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
 I encourage you, sisters

361
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,940
 to carry the question in your heart

362
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,940
 "Come and see"

363
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,940
 Take a look

364
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,940
 Because Jesus is calling us

365
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,940
 "Come and you will see"

366
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,940
 Go forward and take a look

367
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
 Test Jesus

368
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
 Open up your life

369
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,940
 to experience this faith of walking and seeing

370
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,940
 "Come and see"

371
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
 The story is almost at the end

372
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
 Jesus' response to Nathan

373
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,940
 is very encouraging

374
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,940
 He continues

375
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,940
 "For I say, because I saw you in the fruit of the fruitless fruit,

376
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,940
 you will see greater things than these

377
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,940
 He also said, I tell you,

378
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
 you will see the heaven opening,

379
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,940
 and the witness of God coming down on the Son of Man"

380
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
 What does this mean?

381
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
 What does greater things mean?

382
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,940
 What does heaven opening mean?

383
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,940
 What does the witness of God mean?

384
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,940
 Coming down on the Son of Man?

385
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,940
 Actually, Jesus is quoting an old scripture

386
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
 in the Old Testament

387
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,940
 When he was dreaming, he saw the sky ladder

388
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,940
 This is in the 28th chapter of the book of Genesis

389
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,940
 If you have time, you can take a look

390
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,940
 There is an image

391
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,940
 When he was dreaming, he saw the sky ladder

392
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,940
 The witness of God came down on the Son of Man

393
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,940
 After that, the Archon thought, "Wow, God is so powerful

394
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,940
 He is here, I didn't know that"

395
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,940
 He changed the place to Bethel

396
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,940
 which means the house of God

397
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,940
 Simply put, this dream is a powerful spiritual experience for the Archon

398
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,940
 It allows the Archon to experience the presence of God

399
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,940
 It is a blessing to the people on earth

400
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,940
 Jesus redrew this picture

401
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,940
 But the description is a bit different

402
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
 Can you see it?

403
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,940
 One is a ladder, the other is a Son of Man

404
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 The Son of Man, in the book of Genesis, is talking about Nehemiah

405
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,940
 Actually, it is talking about Jesus himself

406
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,940
 So the witness of God came down on Jesus

407
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,940
 Jesus used this example to prove that he is the one who is the witness of God

408
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,940
 He is the bridge between man and God

409
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,940
 If we use John's word, Jesus is the road

410
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,940
 In the Old Testament, God told the angel about the miracle

411
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
 Now, Nehemiah appears

412
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,940
 He is the ultimate miracle

413
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,940
 Jesus is the miracle

414
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,940
 The so-called "reincarnation"

415
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,940
 It means a new era has begun

416
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,940
 If we look at the Bible, the first thing we see is the image of Jesus

417
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,940
 The bigger thing is the signs of Jesus

418
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,940
 We are all familiar with the 5-2-2, the 5,000-man-servant, the water-changing wine, the resurrection of Lazarus

419
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,940
 All these seven signs are shown in John's Gospel

420
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,940
 Why did the author show it this way?

421
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,940
 He also combined the seven "I"s in Jesus' words

422
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,940
 You may have heard of "I am the food of life"

423
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,940
 We just talked about "I am the light of the world"

424
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
 We are all familiar with it

425
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,940
 The "I am" echoes the "I am" in the Old Testament

426
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
 "I am the food of life"

427
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
 It means Jesus is talking about his "divine nature"

428
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,940
 So what I want to say is

429
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
 We need to see what we can see

430
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,940
 How God, through his miracles and his words, tells people who he is

431
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,940
 Just like today, the 9th chapter

432
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,940
 The Bible already has seven different names for Jesus

433
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
 Can you see it?

434
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
 The word may be too small

435
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,940
 It says "Nahahwite"

436
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,940
 "Nahahwite" in the Bible

437
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
 "Jerusalemite"

438
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
 "Lazarus"

439
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
 "Lazarus" in the Bible

440
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
 "Jerusalemite"

441
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
 "Jerusalemite"

442
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
 The Bible is really powerful

443
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
 It already has so many names in the Old Testament

444
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,940
 But each name has a deeper meaning

445
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,940
 The door is still one and a half

446
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,940
 Perhaps Philip or Nathaniel knew that

447
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,940
 Jehoiachin was going to be raised up by the cross

448
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,940
 But I think they never thought

449
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,940
 The place of the raising up was not a political throne

450
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,940
 On the contrary, Jesus was going to be raised up by the cross

451
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,940
 God wanted to show the door of the cross to the people

452
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,940
 To show the meaning of each of the "cleansing"

453
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,940
 Because Jehoiachin wanted the reader to understand who Jesus was

454
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,940
 To understand the true meaning of "the door of the cross"

455
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,940
 In the past, the Gospels were in the city of Bethlehem

456
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,940
 In the New Testament, Christ lived among people like a scene

457
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,940
 Today, Christ is still living with us

458
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
 He still lives in us

459
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
 The Bible says, "Do you believe?"

460
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,940
 "You have to see the greater things"

461
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,940
 It turns out that "believing" is not our end

462
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,940
 We have to slowly pursue the greater things

463
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,940
 God has ordered us to experience Him more

464
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,940
 To see Him more, to see Him, to understand Him

465
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
 To experience His love

466
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
 I will share a story

467
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,940
 I remember once my wife and I went on a visit

468
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,940
 For some reason, the visit was already a milestone

469
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,940
 In other words, after visiting this time

470
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,940
 There should be no more chance to visit these families

471
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,940
 That night, God gave us a feeling

472
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,940
 Every time we visit a family

473
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,940
 We would like to pray and bless them

474
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,940
 We would like to ask God to take care of them and to protect them

475
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
 When we went to this visit

476
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,940
 We met this visitor

477
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,940
 She was a homeless woman who was homeless

478
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,940
 My wife and I prayed with her

479
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,940
 After praying, God touched us

480
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,940
 We asked her, "Do you believe in Jesus?"

481
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,940
 She didn't even think about it

482
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,940
 She said, "Yes, I do"

483
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
 We asked, "Really?"

484
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
 "Yes"

485
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,940
 I was very careful at that time

486
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
 Why?

487
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
 Because I thought that if I invited people to believe in Jesus

488
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
 They would eat lemons

489
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
 So I confirmed my wish

490
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,940
 But I didn't expect that this time

491
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,940
 I just responded to the touch

492
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
 I prayed with them

493
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,940
 And asked them if they wanted to believe in Jesus

494
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,940
 God arranged for my wife and I to go to the harvest together

495
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,940
 To witness the resurrection of the human soul

496
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
 She said she believed in Jesus

497
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,940
 We immediately prayed with her

498
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,940
 And helped her to find a suitable church

499
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,940
 To give her a suitable church

500
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,940
 I thought it was amazing

501
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,940
 After that, my wife and I debriefed with other church members

502
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,940
 We realized that it was not us who brought this woman to face God

503
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,940
 It was God who brought this woman to face God

504
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,940
 To give her to me, my wife, and even the baby in her womb

505
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,940
 To witness her amazing work

506
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,940
 To let us witness the glory of God's work

507
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,940
 I realized more today

508
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,940
 God seemed to be telling us

509
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
 He was telling me

510
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,940
 God had blessed my family to serve Him

511
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,940
 I was looking for a way to go forward

512
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,940
 I was worried that my family and my service would be dragged down

513
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,940
 God saw through my needs

514
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,940
 Through this visit, He seemed to be telling me

515
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,940
 Adrian, don't look at your own limitations

516
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,940
 Look at me with confidence

517
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
 Respond to my love with love

518
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,940
 You and your family will soon see

519
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,940
 What I do in your lives

520
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,940
 Today, I pray to God

521
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,940
 I pray that God will help us to open the eyes of the Holy Spirit

522
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,940
 When we are willing, we can see more

523
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,940
 The Holy Spirit will help us

524
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,940
 Through the Bible, we can witness the Holy Spirit

525
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,940
 We can understand the truth and richness of the Holy Spirit

526
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,940
 I pray that God will help us

527
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
 to see God's presence in our lives

528
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,940
 to see God's glory in our difficulties

529
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,940
 to see God's work in our service

530
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,940
 Sister Ling, next Wednesday, March 5th

531
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,940
 is the Holy Fathers' Day

532
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
 It is the beginning of the Holy Father's Day

533
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,940
 Traditionally, the faithful will fast and pray

534
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,940
 to practice repentance and self-awakening

535
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
 until the day of resurrection

536
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
 Yes, we are very busy today

537
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
 We are so busy that we have no time

538
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,940
 We don't even have time to call Jesus

539
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
 It is really not easy

540
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
 But are we willing to

541
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,940
 in these 40 days of the Holy Fathers' Day

542
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,940
 to separate our eyes from the Holy Spirit?

543
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,940
 Will we learn not to only focus on our own busy schedule and pressure

544
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,940
 but also to learn how to practice self-awakening

545
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,940
 and to stop doing things

546
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
 I have heard people say something

547
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
 in these 40 days

548
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
 They say not to drink coffee or milk tea

549
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,940
 or not to sleep after 12 o'clock

550
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
 or not to use your phone before going to bed

551
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,940
 For me, I used to say

552
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,940
 not to do things that are a retaliation

553
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,940
 to put down our old habits

554
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
 and use our physical feelings

555
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,940
 to focus more

556
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,940
 and pay more attention to Jesus

557
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,940
 I would like to invite you to be quiet

558
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
 and to pray together

559
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,940
 We have a time to meditate

560
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,940
 (music)

561
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,940
 Today, let's see if we can recall

562
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,940
 the vision of Jesus

563
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:17,940
 That vision can go beyond the weakness in our hearts

564
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,940
 and reach our true nature

565
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,940
 God uses the eyes of His love

566
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,940
 to look at us, who are so fragile

567
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,940
 He doesn't want to scare us

568
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,940
 He wants us to feel His tenderness

569
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,940
 Are we willing to open up our lives

570
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,940
 to put down our old habits

571
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,940
 and weaknesses

572
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:56,940
 and embrace Him?

573
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,940
 At the same time, we are thinking

574
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,940
 Today, we have been faithful for a while

575
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,940
 Do we have a deeper desire

576
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,940
 to know Jesus Christ?

577
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,940
 The Bible tells us

578
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,940
 that His name has many meanings

579
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,940
 It has deep, meaningful meanings

580
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,940
 that we may not have discovered yet

581
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,940
 Lord, open up our mouths of the Holy Spirit

582
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,940
 to help us

583
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,940
 Through the words of God

584
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,940
 Through our spiritual practice

585
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
 Through our worship

586
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,940
 Give our hearts to our Lord

587
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,940
 Let us pray together

588
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,940
 Lord Jesus, You are the God who can hear people's prayers

589
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,940
 Today, we may have different thoughts

590
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,940
 in front of you

591
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,940
 We may not dare to look at you

592
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,940
 We may feel very helpless

593
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,940
 or we may not want to be so close to you

594
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
 But the Lord has given us the opportunity

595
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,940
 to look at you

596
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,940
 Through this vision

597
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,940
 we can see your warmth

598
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,940
 Lord, open up our eyes

599
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,940
 Open up our mouths of the Holy Spirit

600
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
 We also want to see

601
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
 the many difficulties in our lives

602
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,940
 that are actually filled with your beautiful words

603
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,940
 Sometimes, it may seem like wishful thinking

604
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,940
 But I know it's not

605
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
 It's a desire

606
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
 When you give us the power of your eyes

607
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,940
 we can see

608
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,940
 that there is another perspective

609
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,940
 and this perspective is to fulfill your beautiful words

610
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,940
 Help us

611
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,940
 Open up our ears

612
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,940
 Open up our eyes

613
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
 to see that

614
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,940
 what you have given us is the best

615
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
 We are weak

616
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,940
 but we ask for your help

617
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,940
 We pray with our hearts

618
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,940
 to be able to

619
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,940
 serve you, Lord Jesus

620
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
 Amen

621
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
 Let's stand up together

622
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
 and sing "Let Yourself Go" again

623
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
 I hope this can be a prayer

624
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,940
 to the Lord Jesus

625
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:34,940
 Let yourself go

626
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,940
 I kneel and offer my life

627
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
 I dare not look at you

628
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,940
 I dare not see you

629
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,940
 I face the ground

630
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,940
 and discover myself

631
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,940
 My blood is boiling

632
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,940
 I have lost

633
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,940
 I have been through a lot

634
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,940
 With the power of my eyes

635
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,940
 Let yourself go

636
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,940
 I kneel and offer my life

637
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,940
 I dare not look at you

638
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
 I dare not see you

639
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,940
 I face the ground

640
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,940
 and discover myself

641
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,940
 My blood is boiling

642
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,940
 I have lost

643
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,940
 I have been through a lot

644
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,940
 With the power of my eyes

645
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,940
 I pray that you can teach me how to live

646
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,940
 I can hear you speak day and night

647
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
 You have inspired me

648
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,940
 I continue to seek and explore

649
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,940
 I pray that you can teach me how to live

650
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,940
 I look at myself

651
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,940
 and seek you

652
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,940
 I put my hands up

653
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
 and wait for you

654
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,940
 We let ourselves go

655
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
 We tell Jesus

656
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
 We humble ourselves before you
