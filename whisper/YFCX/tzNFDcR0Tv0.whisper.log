[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.380]   (Cantonese)
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380]   (Cantonese)
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.860]   When a person needs to lose weight and keep fit
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.660]   he needs to eat too
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.620]   When he went out to eat with his friends
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.100]   what did everyone ask him for in the restaurant?
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.940]   One said, "Can I have a tofu wafer, please, with a cold flower tea"
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.620]   Another said, "Can I have a pork rice bowl with a cold milk tea"
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.980]   And another said, "Can I have a meaty noodle with a cup of tea"
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.300]   When you need to lose weight
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.540]   and control your calories
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.660]   and you want to scream out loud when they talk about food
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.460]   and you are tempted by many things
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.340]   you need to rely on your strong willpower
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.780]   to tell yourself, "No, I need to keep on losing weight"
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.060]   Then you tell your boss, "I want a chicken breast rice with corn juice
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.300]   but with rice, please, with hot water"
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.540]   I believe you are very deliberate when you say this
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.180]   because you have a goal to keep on doing it
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.540]   and you scream out loud to resist the temptation of food
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.540]   I think this is a story about how you need to lose weight and keep fit
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.460]   I also want to say that as Christians
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.380]   not only do you exercise
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.780]   but we also need to keep fit and exercise
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.180]   Today, we will look at the Bible in Genesis 1-21
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.180]   to see if there is anything in our faith life that we need to remind ourselves to persist
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.980]   so that we can turn around
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.780]   Let's read the Bible together
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.820]   Let's read together
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.540]   Ready, go
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.780]   "And the Lord said, 'What the Lord has done
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.340]   is more cunning than the harvest of the whole world.'
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.060]   And the woman said, 'What the Lord has done
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.820]   is more cunning than the harvest of the whole world.'
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.060]   And the woman said to the snake, 'We can eat the fruit of the tree in the garden,
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.060]   but the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.'
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.220]   And the Lord said, 'You cannot eat nor touch, lest you die.'
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.820]   And the snake said to the woman, 'You will not die,
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.060]   for the Lord knows that when you eat, your eyes will be opened,
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.700]   and you will know good and evil as the Lord does.'
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.460]   And the woman saw that the tree was good for eating,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.660]   and it was pleasing to the eye,
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.860]   and it was pleasing to the eye,
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.020]   and it made men wise.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.860]   So she plucked the fruit and ate it,
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.260]   and she gave it to her husband,
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.900]   and he also ate it.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.060]   And their eyes were opened,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.660]   and they knew that they were naked,
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.060]   and they plucked the fruit of the tree and made themselves naked.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.180]   Then the wind rose,
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.140]   and the man and his wife heard the voice of the Lord coming and going in the garden,
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.660]   and they hid in the garden,
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.300]   and they hid from the Lord.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.740]   And the Lord called out to the man,
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.420]   and he said to him, 'Where are you?'
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.460]   And he said, 'I hear your voice in the garden,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.060]   and I am afraid,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.500]   for I am naked,
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.660]   and I have hidden myself.'
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.580]   And the Lord said to him, 'Who told you that you were naked?
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.660]   You ate what was on the tree,
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.100]   and I told you not to eat.'
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.580]   And the man said, 'You are like the woman who was with me,
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.220]   and you ate what was on the tree,
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.860]   and I was scared.'
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.300]   And the Lord said to the woman,
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.340]   'How could you do such a thing?'
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.620]   And the woman said, 'Who told you that I was naked?'
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.820]   Let's pray together.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.820]   Let's pray together.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.820]   God, please help us.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.660]   Through your words, we have received help and guidance.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.460]   And we ask that the Holy Spirit moves in our hearts
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.940]   so that we can have concentration
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.540]   and understand what you want to say to us.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.740]   Let's pray.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.460]   Let's pray.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.460]   In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.220]   Let's move on to the Bible.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.020]   In the first to the fifth chapter of the Bible,
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.300]   it talks about the conversation between the serpent and the woman, Hawa.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.460]   When we look at the fourth chapter,
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.500]   the serpent says to the woman,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.140]   'You will not die.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.740]   For God knows that when you eat,
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.140]   your eyes will open, and you will know good and evil like God.'
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.940]   The serpent wants to induce Adam and Hawa to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.820]   But let's go back to the third chapter.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.060]   In the second chapter, God has given them a command.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.420]   God says, 'You cannot eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.220]   You can eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil,
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.580]   but if you eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil,
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.500]   you will die.'
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500]   But the serpent tells the woman,
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.140]   'You will not die.'
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.220]   The serpent adds a character to the word,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.220]   which is the word 'not' in Chinese,
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.020]   to describe God's words.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.540]   God says, 'For God knows that when you eat,
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.100]   your eyes will open, and you will know good and evil like God.'
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.540]   God wants to induce people to doubt God's love for people
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.220]   and the meaning behind God's words.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.820]   God wants people to think that God is selfish.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.660]   He wants to make people not want to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.100]   God wants to make people not want to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.900]   God wants people to make people not want to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.380]   We can see that the devil wants to provoke people to have a grudge against God.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.140]   He wants people to doubt God's words and orders.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.860]   He wants people to think, 'Why can't I eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil?'
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.140]   At this time, the devil has placed the seed of doubt in people's hearts.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.620]   The serpent indeed induced the devil.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.260]   Gradually, the devil no longer believed God's words
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.700]   or God's orders and intentions.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.260]   He committed a crime.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.660]   I think the sixth chapter talks about
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.660]   when the serpent induced the devil,
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.300]   he took action.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.500]   He said, 'Then the woman saw the fruit of the tree of good and evil,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.620]   which was very good,
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.340]   and could be used as food.'
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.660]   It was very beautiful and pleasing to the eyes.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.500]   It was also very pleasant to the eyes and made people love it.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.500]   So the woman picked up the fruit and ate it.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.700]   She gave it to her husband, Adam,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.900]   who was with her.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.100]   Let's look at the sixth chapter.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.860]   'The woman saw the fruit of the tree of good and evil, which was very good,
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.660]   and could be used as food.'
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.980]   In the original text, it means 'the woman saw that it was good.'
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.580]   Do you remember what happened in the first two chapters of Genesis?
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.900]   God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   When God created the heavens and the earth,
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.700]   do you remember God created the birds in the sky,
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.580]   the stars, the sun, and so on?
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.580]   God also said, 'God saw that it was good.'
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:09.500]   The two sentences and the two descriptions are very similar.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.980]   What is it about?
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.060]   It turns out that people want to be gods or to be their own masters.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.060]   They want to decide what is good,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.780]   what is good, and what is right.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.540]   They think they should act according to their desires.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.540]   Behind the scenes, she is hinting that
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.980]   the woman is doubting God.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.100]   God said that the fruit of the tree of good and evil is bad for people.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.460]   It will kill people after eating it.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.260]   She thinks it is not true.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.100]   It is not right.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.460]   The fruit of the tree of good and evil should not be decided by God.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.460]   It should be decided by people's standards,
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.020]   their will and desires.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.380]   We can see that
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.580]   after Adam and Eve broke God's command,
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.580]   the consequences of the crime were immediate.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.860]   It brought great destruction.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.620]   In the Bible, it is explained to us that
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.860]   after Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of good and evil,
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.980]   there was great destruction.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.820]   The destruction was caused by the relationship between people and God.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.460]   We can see that after people ate the fruit of the tree of good and evil,
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.660]   they began to avoid God's face
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.300]   and fear God's voice.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.940]   This caused a barrier between people and God.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.980]   The relationship was broken.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:31.020]   Before the crime, people were very close to God.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.060]   They would meet in Eden.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.660]   They would talk and talk.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.940]   They enjoyed being in Eden.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.620]   After the crime, they became estranged from God.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.740]   Their relationship was broken.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.580]   The crime also affected the relationship between people.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.980]   Adam and Eve were in the crime.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.140]   Adam once described Eve.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.700]   He said, "Eve is the flesh of my flesh and bone."
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.460]   What is it?
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.940]   It is the flesh and bone.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.140]   It is a very intimate relationship.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.340]   He would never separate from her.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.980]   He loved her very much.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.500]   But after the crime, what did Adam say?
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.420]   In verse 12,
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.780]   "Nahum said, 'You are like the woman who was with me.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.580]   She gave me the fruit of the tree,
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.940]   so I ate it.'"
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.060]   It is said that Adam began to shirk his responsibility.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.540]   He accused Eve of being very dissatisfied with her.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:32.500]   This is when people and people's relationship began to change and weaken after the crime.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.260]   In the same way, people and themselves also changed.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.980]   Before the crime, Adam and Eve were in the flesh.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.620]   They did not feel ashamed.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:49.140]   They were not affected by the crime.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.980]   But in verse 7,
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.220]   after the crime,
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.780]   people and themselves also broke up.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.900]   He said, "When they saw their flesh and bones, they hid."
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.860]   They realized that their flesh and bones were ashamed,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.540]   and they felt uneasy and did not want to face themselves.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.780]   Sisters,
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.740]   I think that after the crime,
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.260]   or after Adam and Eve experienced the crime,
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.460]   they understood one very important thing
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.820]   about the relationship between people, themselves, and God.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.660]   They thought they could decide what was good and what was bad.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.500]   But they realized that they had to create everything.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.100]   God, who created everything, knew everything.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.900]   He knew what was good for people.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:45.180]   God told them not to eat the Nine Fruits of the Cross.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:51.780]   In fact, it was to prevent the greatest destruction,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.100]   whether it was for people, God, or themselves.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.140]   God had a good intention behind the command of people.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.820]   He wanted to do good for people.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.180]   I think it's like when a teacher is a parent,
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.620]   or when you meet children,
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.940]   what would you tell them?
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.860]   Tell them not to play with fire,
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.940]   not to talk to strangers.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.100]   I think it's not just about controlling flesh and blood,
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.020]   not allowing them to do anything.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.820]   It's actually to protect children from being hurt.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.580]   I don't want them to experience any horrible things.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.180]   I'd like to tell you a story about a person.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.980]   Imagine this is a scene.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.420]   Imagine a person,
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.540]   when he goes to school,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.460]   he tells a bad joke behind his classmates' back.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.300]   If someone finds out,
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.260]   he'll be told a bad joke by others.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.580]   I think when this happened,
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.980]   it destroyed his relationship with his friends and classmates.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.380]   People no longer trust him.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.980]   Or when he gets home,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.500]   he wants to watch something romantic,
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.060]   whether it's a video of a 18+ person.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.140]   I think he's afraid of being seen by his family.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.140]   He's also afraid of being caught in some situation.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.820]   Maybe he saw his history on his phone.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.060]   "Why did you go on this website?"
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.780]   Maybe he's afraid of being known.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.260]   He's afraid of being embarrassed.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.420]   He knows he's done something wrong.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.820]   He's afraid to face others,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.500]   afraid to face himself.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.380]   Or maybe he's late for home,
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.860]   he's late for his appointment.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.020]   He's having fun with his friends,
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.180]   or he's busy with something.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.980]   He didn't reply to his parents' messages.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.780]   When he got home, his parents asked,
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.300]   "Why are you home so late?"
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.620]   "We're worried about your safety."
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.300]   "Your parents are so annoying. They're always in charge."
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.460]   Then he started to yell at his parents.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.740]   I wonder if you've ever experienced arguing with your family.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.380]   Arguing with your family is uncomfortable.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.620]   When you get home, you're embarrassed.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.180]   You look at your family like you're in a cold war.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.260]   You're always feeling anxious.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.500]   This is a situation where you're not in a good relationship with your family.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.260]   I think if this is how a person lives,
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.540]   he can say whatever he wants to say.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.740]   He can look into the eyes whenever he wants to see something bad.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.140]   Or if a person is angry,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.980]   angry, or upset,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.380]   he can say something rude or yell at others.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.020]   I think you can imagine that in this person's life,
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.340]   his interpersonal relationships will be ruined.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.900]   I think people don't like him,
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.780]   and he doesn't like himself.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.020]   He's living with his friends and family.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.540]   Or if he's a Christian,
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.340]   he's a Christian,
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.900]   he'll feel guilty about his relationship with God.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.500]   He'll do something that doesn't go with his heart.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.940]   It turns out that sin will make people,
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.140]   themselves,
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.420]   others,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.740]   and God
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.660]   break up.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.300]   Let's go back to these three scenarios.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.740]   Sometimes, in order to break up,
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.460]   God uses the Bible to remind us,
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.460]   to give us a guideline to face the situation.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.740]   The Bible says,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.100]   "Do not judge others."
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.700]   That is, do not criticize others,
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.580]   lest you be criticized.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.020]   The Bible also reminds us to be ready for the punishment.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.020]   When we face our family,
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.380]   as children,
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.020]   we should learn to obey God.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.940]   It's about respecting our parents.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.900]   The next time God reminds us,
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.460]   we should not criticize our parents.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.620]   We should listen to their concerns.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.420]   We should be patient and listen to them.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.900]   We should listen to them with respect.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.860]   What do I want to say here?
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.340]   I believe most of you have been in church for a long time.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.860]   Maybe you've been in church since you were young,
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.620]   maybe you've been in church since you were in K1.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.220]   You know a lot about the Bible,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.420]   or you know a lot about God's commandments,
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.780]   reminders, and orders.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.580]   I think when you read the Bible,
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.300]   you can easily and quickly respond to the teachers,
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.380]   to the preachers,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.740]   and to what we should do.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.220]   But I want to ask you,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.100]   when you say these things,
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.660]   you know what they mean,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.060]   but do you understand
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.500]   what God's will is
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.020]   when He gives us these commandments and words?
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.980]   Have you ever doubted it?
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.140]   "Yes, I think it's true."
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.020]   I think it's like when you compare yourself to people who don't believe in God.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.620]   You think there are a lot of things you need to follow in Christianity.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.620]   Like there are a lot of do's and don'ts.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.340]   You're not satisfied with the requirements.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.700]   You think people outside are more free.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.260]   You have a lot of restrictions.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.420]   But what I want to tell you today is
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:57.340]   that God's orders and commandments
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.820]   are actually God's good will.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.140]   These orders and commandments are not just some cold do's and don'ts.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:12.300]   They are not just something you have to follow.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.820]   God's love for people is behind these orders and commandments.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.500]   God wants to help us get rid of our sins and desires
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.260]   through the commandments and commandments.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.540]   God wants to bring us a relationship with God,
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:32.220]   or destroy us with God, ourselves, and others.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.300]   God wants to give us a rich life.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.660]   But I believe this rich life is about
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:45.300]   a relationship with God, ourselves, and others.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.420]   We humans tend to doubt a lot.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.460]   We think God has given us a lot of harsh requirements.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.060]   But it turns out that God's good will is behind it.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.060]   God's good will is behind the commandments and commandments.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.980]   God wants to remind us not to be influenced by our sins.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.700]   So that when we understand God's good will,
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.940]   we can follow God's good will.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:16.260]   So that we can experience a wonderful life with God and ourselves.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.420]   Let's continue to look at the next part of the scripture.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.540]   When we look at the scripture,
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.620]   when Eve committed a sin,
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.700]   she said her eyes were opened.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.660]   She knew she was naked.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.980]   When she was ashamed,
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.260]   in order to cover up her shame,
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260]   what did she do first?
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.020]   In the seventh chapter, she said,
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.100]   "She made a garment of unripe fruit for herself,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.660]   and made a dress for herself."
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.140]   As I mentioned,
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.620]   this is the third chapter of Genesis.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.420]   The first and second chapters of Genesis
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.580]   talk about God's creation of the universe,
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.220]   the sun, the earth, and many other creatures.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.740]   At that time, the word "creation"
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.860]   was often used to describe God's creation.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.460]   God created something, and so on.
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.460]   In the seventh chapter of Genesis,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.500]   it is the first time that people
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   started to use their own abilities
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.580]   to create things for themselves.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.140]   This is the creation of a dress.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.500]   Before Eve committed a sin,
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.300]   she relied on God's creation.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.940]   God created the whole earth,
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.020]   the air, and everything else that they could enjoy.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.540]   They didn't need to rely on themselves.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.780]   It was a beautiful state.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.820]   But after committing a sin,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.980]   they started to rely on their own abilities
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.460]   to make some amulets.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.940]   After committing a sin,
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.100]   they felt the shame in their lives,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.500]   the fear and anxiety.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.580]   They used their own methods to face it.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.180]   But when Adam and Eve
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.180]   used the leaves of a fig tree
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.420]   to make a dress for themselves,
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.620]   did they feel the shame
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.940]   in their bodies?
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.100]   Or did they feel like they were not brave enough to wear it?
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.180]   I think you may feel that
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.220]   you can't cover your body completely.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.460]   Even if you wear it,
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.860]   you may feel unsafe.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.340]   You may feel uncomfortable.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.580]   I think Adam and Eve tried their best
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.820]   to use their own abilities to make amulets.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.940]   They used the leaves to make a dress
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.740]   to try to cover their feelings of insecurity and shame.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.300]   But they found it was not very useful.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   They still felt a lot of shame.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.180]   In the 8th episode,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.140]   they immediately talked about it.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.820]   When they found that what they did
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:50.020]   was not able to cover their own feelings of insecurity and shame,
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.180]   God came to Adam and Eve.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.980]   God said in the 8th episode,
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.940]   Adam and Eve heard the voice of God walking in the garden.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.500]   God called them.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.660]   God called them and asked, "Where are you?"
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.420]   "Where are you?"
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.340]   I think God knew everything.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.580]   When God asked them, "Where are you?"
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.900]   He did not mean that they did not know where Adam and Eve were.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.420]   He wanted people to walk out
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.620]   and walk out and go back to their creator, their Lord.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.820]   They repent and turn around
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.540]   and receive help.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.860]   When people broke God's command and order,
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.620]   God did not give up on people.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.740]   He was still very gentle and called people.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.420]   This reflects God's love and concern for people.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.380]   Indeed, when Adam and Eve broke God's command and order,
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.220]   they had to bear God's punishment.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.220]   But when we pay attention,
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.260]   God never called people.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:04.060]   Instead, God called the devil himself.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.660]   In the 15th episode,
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.260]   when we read it,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:20.580]   God provided a way to make up for the guilt and fear of people.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.860]   In the 15th episode,
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.620]   God said, "I will make you and the woman be enemies."
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.500]   "The devil's descendants and the woman's descendants will be enemies."
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.660]   God said, "The devil will hurt your head."
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.580]   "You will hurt his legs."
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.860]   Let me explain what this means.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:46.580]   The emphasis on the woman's descendants is very special.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.060]   In the Bible,
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.340]   it is often mentioned in the name of the father
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.460]   who gives birth to whom.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.700]   For example, do you remember who Abraham gave birth to?
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.380]   You don't remember?
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.660]   Isaac.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.340]   Isaac gave birth to Isaac.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:09.300]   In many cases, the Bible is arranged by the father.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.340]   It is rarely mentioned about the woman's descendants.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.180]   But in the Bible,
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.540]   there is a man who was born from a woman,
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.100]   not by the combination of men and women.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.940]   Who is that?
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.620]   Yes, it is Jesus Christ who was born from a virgin.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.540]   In the 3 chapters of Genesis,
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:35.660]   God knows that people are affected by sin.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:41.020]   God has arranged a way to save people in the beginning.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.340]   The way to save people is Jesus Christ.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.500]   It is about the man who will hurt your head.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.940]   Jesus Christ will overcome the devil.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:54.220]   He will defeat the devil and save people from sin.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.020]   He will restore a beautiful relationship between man and God.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.300]   He will hurt the devil's heel.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.500]   What does it mean?
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.700]   It means that Jesus Christ will suffer in this world.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.420]   He will nail a cross on his feet.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.180]   But the purpose of this is to save people.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.340]   When people commit a crime,
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.660]   the crime destroys the beautiful life God gave them.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.740]   When they face the guilt, shame and fear in their hearts,
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.500]   they want to rely on themselves.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.140]   They want to use the leaf of the vine to make a way to save people.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.900]   But when we compare the situation
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.460]   when people rely on their own ability, method and God,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.860]   the situation is completely different.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.700]   The fruitless leaf of the vine
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.380]   wants to cover their shame and anxiety.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.140]   But it is too incomplete.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.620]   It is too weak.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:58.220]   It cannot help people to cover their fear and shame.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:03.460]   It cannot restore the relationship between man and God.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.740]   But the way God offers to save people
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.660]   is to allow Jesus Christ to save people.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.980]   He helps us to overcome our sins
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.540]   and restore the relationship between God and man.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.820]   In the 21st chapter of the Bible,
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.340]   God made a leather garment for people
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.780]   before they were forced to wear clothes.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.020]   It is a proper garment.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.180]   People can wear it to keep warm
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.580]   and to cover their body.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:41.380]   The method and connection and grace God offers to people
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.180]   is very strong and safe.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:49.940]   It can cover the shame and anxiety in people's hearts.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.940]   Sister Ding, sometimes we want to rely on our own method
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:00.740]   to cover our fear, anxiety, guilt and shame in life.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.340]   Have you ever experienced something in your life?
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.300]   Whether it is quarreling with friends or family,
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.940]   or you are very self-abased and don't like yourself,
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.860]   when something happens,
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.580]   do you feel like this?
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.820]   When people ask you, "How are you recently?"
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.900]   You say, "I'm okay."
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.180]   You pretend to be cool and nothing happens.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:27.060]   Or do you sometimes fill your schedule
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.780]   so that you don't have to think about unhappy things?
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.300]   You may participate in more activities,
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.460]   hang out with more friends,
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.620]   use more cell phones,
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.700]   watch more videos on YouTube or look at more Instagram.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.980]   Or is your method
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:48.300]   to make up for your failure?
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.900]   You want to improve your performance
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.500]   and increase your self-esteem.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.460]   Sometimes when you do this,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.700]   you may have some problems in your life
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.900]   that you don't know how to deal with.
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.180]   Or you may have a lot of anxiety and fear.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.940]   You want to use these methods,
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.740]   whether it is to be busy,
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.660]   to satisfy yourself with some achievements,
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.620]   or to improve your sense of value and existence.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.380]   Frankly speaking,
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.580]   as a translator,
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.300]   I sometimes do this.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.500]   I want to avoid uncomfortable feelings
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.660]   and use my own methods.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.100]   But have you noticed that when you use these methods,
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.460]   they only make you feel better in a short time?
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.940]   When you use achievements to prove your value,
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.900]   you will find that when the results rise and fall,
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:43.860]   your value will rise and fall with the results.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.380]   I don't know if you are in the same situation.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.980]   I want to share my story.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.900]   Maybe you in China have never heard of my story of growing up.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.460]   I grew up in a single-parent family.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.540]   When I was in primary school, my parents divorced.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.940]   Then my family, me, my mother and my brother,
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.500]   went to live with our own money.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.260]   I remember that my life changed a lot
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.100]   after my parents divorced.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.620]   I started to feel very uncomfortable and shy in my family.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.220]   I think the most intense thing was
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.100]   when I was in primary school,
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.740]   I usually didn't know what to do after school.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.660]   Maybe my friends and classmates would go to school to study.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.060]   I would usually tell my classmates,
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.700]   "I'm going home."
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.100]   Because my family didn't have enough money to send me to school,
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.060]   or to send me to study.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.020]   I wanted to study.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.580]   During this process,
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.220]   every time I compared myself with my classmates,
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.500]   I would feel that my family was worse than others.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.700]   I felt ashamed and insecure.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.860]   What was my method at that time?
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.700]   I wanted to erase this feeling of unhappiness.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.060]   I focused on studying, and I tried hard to study.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.060]   I wanted to be a good student,
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.060]   to prove that I was worth it.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.060]   I was okay.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.660]   I wanted to cover up my shyness
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.700]   or the feeling of being inferior to others.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.460]   But I found that when I got good grades,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.060]   when I got good grades,
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.500]   my heart, my mood, and my value,
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.100]   my value of freedom would gradually decrease.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.860]   I used to go to my friends' houses.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.460]   They would say, "Come to my house to play."
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.900]   When I saw their houses,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.660]   and compared them with my house,
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.460]   I would feel a sudden surge of unease and shyness.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.780]   It was a feeling of uncertainty.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.380]   I think when I was in high school,
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.780]   I started to have friends who took me to church.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.500]   I think for me,
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.100]   to meet God, to understand God,
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.380]   and to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.300]   the biggest thing for me was
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.780]   I believe that God is unconditional love and acceptance.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.300]   God is very clear.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.380]   I know that He doesn't look at me based on my ability,
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.700]   He doesn't look at me based on my appearance,
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.580]   nor does He look at me based on my family background,
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.900]   or my family's growth.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.700]   He doesn't look at me based on whether I did something wrong
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.780]   and how He loves me.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.660]   He says, "No matter what I am,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.620]   my most true self is accepted and forgiven."
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.060]   Sister Ling, when God went to look for Adam and Eve
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.860]   and called them,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.940]   they were still wearing the garment of the tree of the fruitless fruit.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.220]   They were wearing the uncertainty of life
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.780]   and the shame of their guilt towards God
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.540]   until they met God.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.940]   But when they were so honest and true
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.860]   and went to meet God,
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.180]   when they admitted their needs and weaknesses,
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.820]   God finally
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.940]   helped them with their affection and their grace.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.660]   He prepared a garment of the fruit of their guilt
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.260]   and a garment of their skin.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.660]   I believe that God's love and affection
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:22.540]   erased the anxiety, shame and fear in their hearts.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.420]   I don't know if you want to experience
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.660]   the grace God gave us.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.220]   I would like to invite the worship team.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.780]   Sister Ling,
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.380]   God has been looking for us.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.620]   But sometimes we are like Adam and Eve.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.900]   We hide ourselves and don't want to be found by God.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.820]   But God is still calling us today.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.540]   We can bring our life's problems,
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.700]   weaknesses and shame
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.460]   to God
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.980]   and receive God's help.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.500]   I want us to rise up
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.740]   and write our response to God through this song.
