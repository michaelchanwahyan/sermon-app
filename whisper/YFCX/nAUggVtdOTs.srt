1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(音樂)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 丁姐妹,早安 (丁姐妹)早安

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 不知道剛才你敬拜的時候

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 你看不看當中你能否經受上帝的愛

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 今天好像少了這麼多人

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 是不是有些人已經離開香港

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 或者已經回到外國讀書

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 可能已經離開了

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 不知道大家看不看

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 敬拜那種你經歷上的愛那種正

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 剛才阿君崇拜前祈禱的時候說

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 今天原來是中三最後一次在初中崇拜

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 下一次大家已經升上高中

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 中一中二那些

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 哇,你有長大了

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 因為下個禮拜是合堂崇拜

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 我們不會在這裡聚會

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 下個禮拜合堂崇拜

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 下個禮拜就會是一個新的景象

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 所以鼓勵大家,我不知道中一中二你過了一兩年

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 其實你在初中的時候有什麼體會

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 但是如果你回教會,可能你回崇拜

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 都鼓勵你可以一起去敬拜

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 我猜你試試不合音的

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 你就試試唱歌詞對你來說有什麼體會

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 我覺得這個也是很重要的

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 我以前小時候也是這樣經歷,不知道歌詞怎麼唱

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 但我覺得唱的時候你會經歷到長大更加多

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 所以鼓勵大家一起去學習

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 今天跟大家分享這個題目

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 因為Shining Orchids with the Light

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 應該這個禮拜是最後一個禮拜

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 因為下個禮拜,房牧師會為我們帶來新一年度

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 其實有什麼新的主題

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 今年Shining Orchids with the Light,大家都知道是今年的年題

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 每個禮拜都跟大家分享今年的主題

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 甚至我們的活動都經常說我們要Shining 什麼什麼

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 又要派禮物,鼓勵大家在這個環境下要為主做燃燒光

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 我想這個題目大家都很出的

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 大家都深深記住在你的腦海裡

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 不過我在預備今天的講章的時候,我也思想一個問題

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 即是今個禮拜已經是最後一個禮拜去講這個主題

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 問一下自己,究竟這個主題其實在你生命裡面

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 在你信仰裡面,其實你有多感受到這個主題

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 其實是你作為基督徒一定要做的事呢

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 坦白說,如果這個主題你不覺得跟你有什麼關係的話

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 這個主題其實只是今年青少年題的一個口號

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 今天很想跟大家去講,剛才出了一個題目

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 就叫做「全民造星」

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 可能你想全民造星的時候,你會想起Mirror,Anson Lo,Ian

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 不過我今天都不是講這些

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 今天很想跟大家分享《肥辣秘書》二章十二至十八節的經文

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 其實保羅都鼓勵當時的人去全民造星

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 鼓勵他們要在當時的處境裡面去發光

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 先賣個關子給大家,為什麼我今天頂這個題目叫「全民造星」呢

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 原來保羅在這段經文很特別,一會大家看的時候都會知道

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 原來保羅鼓勵當時的信徒去做一件事

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 他們要成為一顆星在那個世代裡面去照耀,成為黑暗中的光

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 怎樣去做呢,很想邀請大家讀了這幾個經文,十二至十八節

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 準備,起

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 請看來

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:29,000


63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:54,000


64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000


65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000


66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000


67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000


68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000


69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000


70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,000


71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000


72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000


73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000


74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:59,000


75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:09,000


76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
