[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Can you give a round of applause to the team?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Whether it's AB team, CC team or the audience
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Okay
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Let's take a look at your faces
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's so unfamiliar, I don't know why I suddenly notice your faces
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Or you've grown up a year earlier?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   It's summer vacation, you must be busy
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Are you so busy that you are exhausted?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   I hope God will continue to bless you and speak to you
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My topic today is Fighting
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I've been watching Korean dramas
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   They always say "Fighting, Fighting, Fighting"
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Not only Korean dramas
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   My husband told me a few months ago
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.000]   He always told me about Jackie Chan
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   He said "Lately, many people are talking about Jackie Chan"
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I asked "Who is Jackie Chan?"
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   "Jackie Chan, who do you think of?"
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I only know this Jackie Chan
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Lee Ka-shing
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   In my generation, I said "Why am I not Lee Ka-shing?"
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I believe your generation is like
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   "Why am I not Lee Ka-shing's son?"
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Right?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I only know this Jackie Chan
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   But my husband said that Jackie Chan is not Jackie Chan
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.000]   Next hard point
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   This is "The Hunters"
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Song Hunter
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I was influenced by my husband
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I studied in the top level
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's a Korean web novel
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Later, I made a cartoon
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Do you know him?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   If you don't know him, please tell me
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   If you know him, please listen to it again
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.000]   He is a hunter
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   He is the weakest hunter
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Many people laugh at him
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   He is the weakest weapon of human
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Until he awoke
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   He is much more powerful
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   He keeps upgrading himself
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He is getting stronger
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   One of his strong points is
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   When he defeated his opponent
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   He would take revenge
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And become his weapon
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.000]   Next time, he would summon his opponent
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   To help him
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I mentioned a lot about Song Hunter
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   What do I want to say?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I want to say
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   As a believer
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Why do I suddenly have a hair?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Is it a moustache?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I am so scared
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Why do I suddenly have a moustache?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I am talking about my hair
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You are talking about my mouth
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.000]   Let's come back to the topic
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   What do I want to say?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   As a believer
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   We believe in Jesus
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Our spiritual life is awakened
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   We are new people
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   But we can't live a completely
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Spiritual life
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Why?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Because we are participating in a spiritual battle
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   In this spiritual battle
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   What kind of equipment do we need
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   To deal with our enemies?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.960]   How can we win in the battle?
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   I want to share with you
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Some of the reminders in the Bible
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   The Bible is 6 chapters
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   10 to 20 verses
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   You may be familiar with the Bible
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   The Book of Ecclesiastes
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.960]   I want to invite you to read it
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.960]   Ready?
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   "You must rely on the Lord
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   To rely on his great power to make the strong
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   To wear the armor of the Father
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.960]   To resist the devil's tricks
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   For our battle
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   Is not against the flesh and blood
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   But against those who are in power
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.960]   Who rule the dark world
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   And the evil spirits of the heaven and the earth
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   So you must wear the armor of the Father
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   So that you can resist the enemy in the day of evil
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   And after you have done all
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   You can still stand
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.960]   So you must stand
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   You must use truth as a bandage
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   Use justice as a protective mirror
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   Use peace as a shoe
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   To prevent you from walking
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   You must use faith as a shield
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   To break the evil
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   And burn all the sins
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   You must wear the helmet of salvation
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   And the sword of the Holy Spirit
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   This is the way of God
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.960]   You must rely on the Holy Spirit
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   To pray for you in all directions
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   And to be vigilant for this
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   Pray for the good
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   Pray for me too
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   Let me have the courage
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   To speak out the praise of the Lord
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   I have made a chain of the Lord's praise
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   Let me speak out the praise of the Lord
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   As I have done
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   As you have prayed with the Father
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.960]   Let me pray for you
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   We know that it is hard to live a good life
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   By ourselves
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   It is hard to live a life of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   I pray that the Lord will speak to us today
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   And be with us
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   Open our eyes of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   Let us see the true truth
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   Let us live the truth
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   By relying on the Holy Spirit
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   Let us pray in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   Amen
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   Let me talk a little bit about the simple background of the book of Ephesians
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   There are six chapters in the book of Ephesians
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   The first chapter is about a man who believes in Jesus
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   And has a new identity
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.920]   The fourth and sixth chapters are about
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   A new man with a new identity
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   What should be his life behavior?
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   It should be different
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   The sixth chapter we just read
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   The tenth chapter is about
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   There are verses that say
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   "From now on"
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   A man who believes in the Lord
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   Has a new identity
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   From now on
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.920]   He should rely on the Lord to be strong
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.920]   To be strong
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   According to the original text
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   It is a passive order
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   And the current situation
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.920]   What does it mean?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   It means that the believer
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   Does not rely on himself to be strong
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   He should rely on God to be strong
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   And not only once
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   It has a continuous meaning
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   He should constantly rely on God
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   Why is it so emphasized?
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   After believing in the Lord
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   We should rely on God
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   Because the believer is facing
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.920]   A conflict
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   Our opponent
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   Or our enemy
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.920]   Is not a person
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   But a devil in the spirit world
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   The Bible describes
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   The one who is in charge
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   Who is in power
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   Who controls the dark world
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   And the devil in the spirit world
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   It is a supernatural existence
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   The area they control
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   Is the world on earth
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   Yes
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   It must be
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.920]   It is the world on earth
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   Especially in the aspect of sin
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   And worshiping idols
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   I am not talking about K-pop idols
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   The fake gods
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   They are behind them
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   Controlling them
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   Controlling them in the dark force
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   So it is not by ourselves
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   We can defeat the devil
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   Although the devil
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   Or the evil spirit
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   Is very powerful
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.920]   But it will not appear casually
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   To be honest
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   If the devil or evil spirit
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   Appears in front of us
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.920]   We will be very scared
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   But I think we will
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   Rely on God more
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   Because it is very real
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   Appears in front of us
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.920]   But it is very cunning
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   The devil will not use his knife and gun
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   As the saying goes
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.920]   It is hard to defend against the dark force
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   But it is very cunning
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.920]   When we are not aware
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   It will set traps for us
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   To make us fall into the trap
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   We may not even
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   Realize the existence of the devil
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.920]   Because the devil
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   Has been living in this world longer than us
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   He knows that
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   Directly showing up
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   And threatening us
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   Will not work
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   We will have to be more sure
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   Of the truth of God
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   More sure
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   That we need to rely on God
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.920]   But he may hide
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.920]   In the so-called feng shui
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   In the constellation and the book
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   In those things
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   Through these processes
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   We may gain some benefits
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   And predict the future
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.920]   We may not realize it
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   But we will believe in it
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   I am serious
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   Have you seen the constellation?
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   Have you played the tower cards?
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   I am serious
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   I heard that young people
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.920]   Don't know that
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   These things are not supposed to be played
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.920]   They may try to predict their future
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   But it is not
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   These are all the tricks of the devil
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.920]   The devil will not notice
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   And set traps for us
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.920]   To make us fall into the trap
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   So we need to be more sure
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   Not rely on ourselves
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920]   But rely on God
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   We need to wear the full-armor
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   The full-armor is called
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   The whole arm of God
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.880]   The whole arm of God
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   The whole arm of God
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   For us to wear
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.880]   The full-armor is used
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   To resist the devil
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   In the 11th and 13th chapters
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.880]   It is said that we need to resist the devil
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.880]   And to be able to stand
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   It is interesting
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   The word "resist"
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   Is the same word as "stand"
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   In the 13th chapter
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   Yes
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   What does it mean?
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   It means that we need to rely on God
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   To stand steadily
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.840]   Not to win
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   Not to defeat the devil
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   Because we cannot defeat the devil
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840]   Only God can defeat the devil
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   But we can rely on God
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.840]   To stand steadily
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   And not fall into the trap
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   As a believer
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   I think we want to live a life of the Lord
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.840]   We want our life
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   Our life to be filled with the joy of God
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   But why sometimes it does not work?
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   We always fall weakly
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   It is because we are facing a battle of the Lord
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.800]   We need to recognize our enemy
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   Who is our enemy?
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   Look at the person next to me
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Yes, it is not him
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   Our enemy
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   Is Satan
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   It is the evil spirit
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   Do you know?
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   Yes
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   The devil is the weakest point of all workers
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   Yes
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   It keeps us away from God
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   Most importantly
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   It is not aware of the fact that we are leaving God
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   So we need to rely on God
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   But sometimes
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.800]   We do not understand the spiritual growth
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   Why?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   Because we are used to
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   Rely on our eyes
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   It is practical to see with our eyes
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   I am from the previous generation
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   I am definitely from the previous generation
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   I am not from the second generation
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   My parents are all worshipping God
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   They are worshipping idols
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   Worshipping false gods
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   I have a landlord at home
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.800]   I worship the landlord
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   I also worship God
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   I did not believe in Jesus
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   I asked my mother
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   Who is the God I worship?
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   She said
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   "It does not matter
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   It is just a worship of God"
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   She could not answer me
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   I remember when I was young
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   I used to go to the temple to ask for an autograph
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   I do not know if you know
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   There are two types of autographs
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   The upper one is good
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   The lower one is bad
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   It is not easy
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.800]   I remember when I asked for an autograph
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   I was sincere
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   If I could get the lower one
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   What would you do?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   I would put it back
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   I am like this
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   I am like this
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   When I did not believe in God
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   I did superstitions
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   But I found that
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   You also do superstitions
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   For example
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   How to cut a cake?
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   Do not cut it to the bottom
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   Right?
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.800]   You can't cut it to the bottom
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   Right?
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   (Laughter)
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   So there is no problem with the bottom
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   It is just a superstition
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   (Laughter)
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   When you say something
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   That does not sound good
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   You will say
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   "Touch wood"
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   No, it is iron
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   (Laughter)
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   You are the new generation
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   You also have superstitions
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   Yes, really
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   I was like this when I was young
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.800]   I had contact with idols
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   I had contact with evil spirits
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   Even when I was a monk
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   I had experienced
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   The interference of the spirit world
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   I used to worship idols when I was young
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   I went to many temples
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   To worship gods
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   I had many contact with the spirit world
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   Even when I was a Christian
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   I had experienced the interference of the spirit world
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   I tried to sleep
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.760]   I was afraid
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   I was afraid
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   I was afraid that I would cover my ears
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   (Laughter)
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   I tried to sleep
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   I could not move
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   I was rational
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.760]   It was a psychological effect
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   I tried to close my eyes
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   I could not close my eyes
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   I could not move
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   I was afraid
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   When I was young
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.760]   I was not in the "Yin and Fung" church
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   I was in another church
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.760]   They taught me very quickly
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   If you encounter evil spirits
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.760]   Remember to run away in Jesus' name
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   I ran away in Jesus' name
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   I could not move
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   I was afraid
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   They even talked to me
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   I was very nervous
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.760]   There was a man talking to me
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   I said, "Run away in Jesus' name"
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   He talked to me
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   He said, "Jesus, I know him"
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.760]   I was very afraid
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   I could not move
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.760]   It was very interesting
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   I do not know why
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   Suddenly, a song came to my mind
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.760]   A poem came to my mind
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   I sang this poem in primary school
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   I sang this poem for 6 years
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   I grew up in a Catholic school
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   Can you guess what song I sang?
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.760]   You know it, Xiao Feng?
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   (Laughter)
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.760]   Stop kidding
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.760]   What is it?
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.760]   My poem is called "This is the world of the rich"
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   I sang this poem for 6 years
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   Suddenly, a poem came to my mind
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.760]   "This is the world of the rich"
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.760]   I fell asleep
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760]   I was relaxed
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   Sister, I do not want to scare you
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.760]   I do not want to scare you
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.760]   I want to tell you that
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   the spiritual world is very real
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   I do not expect you to encounter this
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   Do not worry
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   We who belong to God
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.760]   have God's protection
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   Do not worry
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   In the end, the devil will leave me
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.760]   and leave you
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   God will protect you
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   But really
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.760]   Sister, the spiritual world is very real
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.760]   Of course, the devil will not use such a cheap trick
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.760]   like I did in the past
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   I was scared and became a propagandist
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   (Laughter)
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.760]   He will not use such a trick to scare you
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   Because he knows it will not work
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   It may even have a counter effect
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.760]   Maybe he is more faithful
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   God is very real
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   But really
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.760]   The devil may use other things to lure us
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   to make us fall into weakness
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   and make us leave God
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.760]   We need to recognize who our enemy is
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.760]   We need to use the right weapon to deal with him
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.760]   Okay
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.760]   Use the right weapon
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   What weapon?
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   Let's continue to look at the scripture below
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   What is in this weapon?
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   Let's look at the 14th chapter
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   It appears again
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   It is about the balance
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   The balance in the 14th chapter
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   is the same as in the 11th and 13th chapters
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.760]   So it emphasizes that we must stand firm
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   and not be hit by the devil
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.760]   What does this weapon include?
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   It includes the truth
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   The truth is about the gospel
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   and the teaching of the Bible
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   The word "truth" means to be ready
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760]   It means to be ready
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   Are you familiar with the Bible?
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   Are you ready to tell people about the Bible?
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   Or are you just a half bottle of water?
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   Use justice as a shield
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.760]   It means we need to be a faithful
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.760]   and righteous person
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   But today
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.760]   we need to show our righteousness
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.760]   Use peace and harmony as a bridge
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   This sentence is from the Old Testament
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   It says we need to have a job of preaching
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   We need to take the initiative
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   to share the content of the gospel
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   "Believe and act as a shield
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.760]   to wipe out all the evil"
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.760]   A rocket will cause harm to the enemy
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   and even disturb the people
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   But it may not be fatal
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   The same goes for the devil
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   The devil may not give us a fatal blow
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   but it may disturb our faith
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   and our vigilance
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   So we need to resist with faith
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.760]   Also, wear a helmet of salvation
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   It is very important
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.760]   We are saved today
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.760]   No one can condemn us
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.760]   We will not go to hell
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.760]   We are already saved in the presence of God
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.760]   This is very important
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.760]   The sword of the Holy Spirit is the way of God
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.760]   The Bible is the way of God
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.760]   I have talked about this military uniform
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   You may have heard of it since you were a child
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   Have you noticed
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   the special feature of this uniform?
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   It is often used as a defensive weapon
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.760]   It is not very aggressive
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.760]   Even the sword of the Holy Spirit
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   is a word of God
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.760]   It reminds me of Jesus
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.760]   when he was tested
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   He used the word of God
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.760]   to defeat the devil
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   It seems that this military uniform
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   is not for close combat
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   but for defensive
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   Yes
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   As believers
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   we need to know the truth
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.760]   Is it safe?
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.760]   Is it well-known?
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.760]   Can we keep the faith?
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.760]   Can we distinguish
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.760]   which is the word of God
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   which is the will of God
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   which is the trick of the devil
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.760]   so that we will not fall into the trap of the devil
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   Our life and actions
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   can only come out of the Christian style
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.760]   and the gospel
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.760]   As I said
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   the devil is very smart
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   He will not show up to scare us
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.760]   but to attack our weak spot
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.760]   and make us fall from God
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.760]   I heard a young man say
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.760]   why do I always pray
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   but God does not listen to me
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.760]   and I am still in a lot of trouble
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.760]   But the person next to me
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.760]   or the people I do not believe in
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.760]   may live a better life than me
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   Should I still keep the faith?
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.760]   Do I really believe that God exists?
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.760]   I don't know if you feel the same
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   When something unpleasant
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.760]   happens in our life
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.760]   we start to question God
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   Is God real?
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.760]   Does God love me?
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.760]   Does prayer work?
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   Is this faith possible?
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   Just now
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.760]   when DSC released the list
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.760]   Sister, I don't know how many of you
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.760]   have faced DSC and released the list
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.760]   When you see the results
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.760]   do you question God?
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.760]   God, why don't you bless me?
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.760]   Why did my Chinese break?
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.760]   Will it happen?
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.760]   Sometimes the devil uses these situations
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.760]   to make us question
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.760]   God, are you real?
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   God, do you love me?
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   The devil uses these situations
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.760]   to make us question God
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.760]   Or maybe
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760]   today
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   I know many of you are busy
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   in the service
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.760]   You are busy in the service
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   but the devil can test us
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   in the service
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   Maybe you are busy
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   in the service
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   You are the group leader
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   You are the senior mentor
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.760]   You are the first camp leader
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.760]   You are the first camp leader
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   You are the one who went to Cambodia
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   You are the one who went to Taiwan
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.760]   You are the one who went to the local school
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.760]   You should not be the one
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760]   You met the local school in Taiwan
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.760]   Are you really busy?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.760]   You are really busy in the service
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   but you do not forget
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   that there are more important things
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   than the service
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   Some people say
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   in the service
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.760]   you interact with people
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.760]   there are many conflicts
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   which make you
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   have many friction with the senior mentors
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   which hurts your faith
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   and your faith
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.760]   You even have a broken relationship
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.760]   with the group
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   Yes
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.760]   Not necessarily in the church
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.760]   but in the church
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   the devil can not test you
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   in the church
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.760]   Maybe the devil is testing us
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.760]   with these things
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.760]   and hurting our faith
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.760]   and destroying our
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.760]   relationship with the faith
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   Jesus said
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   Satan will get you
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   Next passage
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   Next passage
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   Next PowerPoint, please
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.760]   He said
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.800]   He will get you like a piece of tin
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.760]   What does it mean?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   It means he will get you
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   in a simple way
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   Yes
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   It is true
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   So sisters
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.760]   you should wear the uniform
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.760]   and stand up straight
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.760]   to distinguish
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   which is the voice of the devil
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   and which is the voice of God
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   which is the voice of the Bible
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   How does God look at me?
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   How does God look at me?
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.760]   What does God want me to do?
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.760]   Yes
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   God does not want me
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.760]   to lose my faith
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.760]   God does not want me
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   to fail in my studies
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760]   God does not want me
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.760]   to destroy my relationship
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.760]   with others
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.760]   God does not want me
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.760]   to be at odds
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   with you
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   God does not want me
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.760]   to be away from the group
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.760]   or the faith
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.760]   You may encounter
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.760]   something unintentional
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.760]   We should distinguish
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.760]   between the two
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.760]   The word "village"
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   in the word "village"
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   refers to a village
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.760]   It means that you will not be able to take it off
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   when you wear it
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.760]   It means that you will not be able to
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   take it off
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.760]   when you wear it
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.760]   when it is cold
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   or when it is hot
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.760]   or when you wear a jacket
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   It does not mean that
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   You will not be able to take it off
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   when you wear it
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.760]   We are not
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   wearing the uniform
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   as a choice
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   We are not
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760]   listening to God's words
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.760]   as a choice
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.760]   You may ask
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   "I do not have to wear
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   the uniform all the time
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.760]   I am not that weak
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   I do not fall into
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   the trap of the devil
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.760]   I do not lose my confidence
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   I do not doubt God
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   If you have the chance
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   to read the second chapter
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   the first chapter
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   In the second to the third chapter
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   it says
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   "When"
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   "When"
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   means when we do not believe in God
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   "you will live
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   in sin again
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.720]   and will be a leader
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   in the world
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   who is the devil
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   who is now working in the hearts of the wicked
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   We have also lived
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   in their midst
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   indulging in the lust of flesh
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   and doing what the flesh
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   and the thoughts of the heart
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   do, like others
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   and we will be
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   the ones who are punished
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   What is it saying?
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   Paul reminds us
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   that when we do not believe in God
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   we like those lives
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.720]   we like those criminal lives
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   we like the test of the devil
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   we like to do what we do
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   We are used to it
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   So, the bad things
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   falling into the trap of the devil
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   are just things that happen
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   casually
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   Doing bad things
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   is more comfortable for us
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   Because before we believe in God
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   we are used to
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   those lives
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.720]   Doing things that do not
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   conform to God's will
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   and offending God
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   is more comfortable for us
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   So, we need to remind ourselves
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   to wear this uniform
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   and not take it off
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   Sisters
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   We need to discern the voice of the devil
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   and resist the test of the devil
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   We need to wear this uniform
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   not according to our preferences
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   but wear it often
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   so that we can
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.720]   resist the test of the devil
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   and make our lives
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   stand steadily
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   At last
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   the 18th to 20th verses
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   It talks about prayer
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   According to the structure of the original text
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   what is it saying?
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   Prayer has two purposes
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   The first purpose is
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   to make me have the ability
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   to speak openly
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   and to be proud of my recitation
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   The second purpose is
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   to make me be able to
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   speak out openly
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   according to my duty
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.720]   Actually, these two purposes
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   are similar
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   Simply speaking
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   it is related to the recitation
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   We need to do a good job
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   in the recitation
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   But to do a good job
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   in the recitation
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   it is important for many people
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   to believe in Jesus
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   and to pray
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   Paul saw that
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   he needed to pray for him
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   Why did he need to pray for Paul?
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   Because at that time
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   when Paul was writing this letter
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   he was in prison
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   He was arrested
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.720]   He was in prison
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   He could not freely
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.720]   preach the gospel
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   He hoped to be released earlier
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   If you are familiar with the Bible
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   you will know that
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   Paul was very powerful
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   Although he was in prison
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   he continued to preach the gospel
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   to the soldiers and the prisoners
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   So Paul prayed for his disciples
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   Even if he was in prison
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   he hoped he could
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   preach the gospel
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   and make people believe in Jesus
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   But it is very special
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   Paul not only asked people
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   to pray for him
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   Paul also said
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   to pray for the disciples
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.720]   including him and me
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   I guess
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   the disciples were worried
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   about Paul
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   whether he was in prison
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   or something happened
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   whether he was sick
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   They prayed for the disciples
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   Maybe the disciples
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   lost their faith
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Paul was a great
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   missionary
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   a great man
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   He was in prison
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   and suffered
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   It was hurting the disciples' faith
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   So they prayed for the disciples
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   not to lose their faith
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   because of Paul's imprisonment
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.680]   But I believe
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   what is more important
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   is that the disciples
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   need to preach the gospel
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   because preaching the gospel
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   is not Paul's sole responsibility
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   All the disciples
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   are the messengers of the gospel
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   We are all responsible
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   So we need to do
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   this kind of work
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   But to do this kind of work
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.680]   we need the help of the Holy Spirit
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   It is not just me praying for the disciples
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.680]   I pray for them to be strong and strong
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   to be rich
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   to make them believe in Jesus
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   It is not just me
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   to convince them
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   to repent and believe in the gospel
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   It is the Holy Spirit
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.680]   working in their hearts
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   The Holy Spirit is God
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.680]   No matter what we say
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   we cannot leave God
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   We cannot not rely on God
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   Prayer is very important
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   Prayer is a humble heart
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.680]   We need to pray to God
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   to help us
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.680]   "God, I cannot do this
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   Please help me"
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   It is a humble heart
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   to pray to God for help
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   The gospel is not
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   a personal gift
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.680]   It is a success
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   because of the power of the gospel
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   What is more important
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   is the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   in people's hearts
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   I would like to share
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   a story about the gospel
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   with you
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   Once, a brother
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   whose father was sick
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.680]   and was admitted to the hospital
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   He asked me to preach the gospel
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   This brother
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   had believed in the gospel for more than 10 years
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.680]   He was holding a lamp
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   and was praying
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   "Hail to the Lord, the Lord is with us"
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   Do you know this?
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   I do not know
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   I always think you are the second generation
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   You do not understand the gospel
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   Or
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   "Please put a Hello Kitty here"
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   No, it is the "Cat of God"
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   (Laughter)
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   "Please put it there"
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   "I have a bad luck today"
