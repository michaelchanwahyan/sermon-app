1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Can you give a round of applause to the team?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Whether it's AB team, CC team or the audience

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Okay

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Let's take a look at your faces

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 It's so unfamiliar, I don't know why I suddenly notice your faces

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Or you've grown up a year earlier?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 It's summer vacation, you must be busy

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Are you so busy that you are exhausted?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope God will continue to bless you and speak to you

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 My topic today is Fighting

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I've been watching Korean dramas

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 They always say "Fighting, Fighting, Fighting"

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Not only Korean dramas

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 My husband told me a few months ago

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,000
 He always told me about Jackie Chan

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 He said "Lately, many people are talking about Jackie Chan"

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I asked "Who is Jackie Chan?"

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 "Jackie Chan, who do you think of?"

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I only know this Jackie Chan

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Lee Ka-shing

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 In my generation, I said "Why am I not Lee Ka-shing?"

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I believe your generation is like

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 "Why am I not Lee Ka-shing's son?"

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Right?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I only know this Jackie Chan

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But my husband said that Jackie Chan is not Jackie Chan

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,000
 Next hard point

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 This is "The Hunters"

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Song Hunter

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I was influenced by my husband

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I studied in the top level

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's a Korean web novel

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Later, I made a cartoon

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Do you know him?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 If you don't know him, please tell me

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 If you know him, please listen to it again

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,000
 He is a hunter

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 He is the weakest hunter

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Many people laugh at him

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 He is the weakest weapon of human

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Until he awoke

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He is much more powerful

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 He keeps upgrading himself

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 He is getting stronger

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 One of his strong points is

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 When he defeated his opponent

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 He would take revenge

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And become his weapon

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,000
 Next time, he would summon his opponent

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 To help him

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I mentioned a lot about Song Hunter

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 What do I want to say?

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I want to say

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 As a believer

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Why do I suddenly have a hair?

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Is it a moustache?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I am so scared

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Why do I suddenly have a moustache?

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I am talking about my hair

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 You are talking about my mouth

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,000
 Let's come back to the topic

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 What do I want to say?

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 As a believer

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We believe in Jesus

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Our spiritual life is awakened

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 We are new people

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 But we can't live a completely

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Spiritual life

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Why?

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Because we are participating in a spiritual battle

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 In this spiritual battle

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 What kind of equipment do we need

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 To deal with our enemies?

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,960
 How can we win in the battle?

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
 I want to share with you

76
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,960
 Some of the reminders in the Bible

77
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,960
 The Bible is 6 chapters

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
 10 to 20 verses

79
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
 You may be familiar with the Bible

80
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
 The Book of Ecclesiastes

81
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
 I want to invite you to read it

82
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
 Ready?

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,960
 "You must rely on the Lord

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,960
 To rely on his great power to make the strong

85
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,960
 To wear the armor of the Father

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,960
 To resist the devil's tricks

87
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
 For our battle

88
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
 Is not against the flesh and blood

89
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
 But against those who are in power

90
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,960
 Who rule the dark world

91
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,960
 And the evil spirits of the heaven and the earth

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,960
 So you must wear the armor of the Father

93
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,960
 So that you can resist the enemy in the day of evil

94
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
 And after you have done all

95
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
 You can still stand

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,960
 So you must stand

97
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,960
 You must use truth as a bandage

98
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,960
 Use justice as a protective mirror

99
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,960
 Use peace as a shoe

100
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,960
 To prevent you from walking

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
 You must use faith as a shield

102
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
 To break the evil

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
 And burn all the sins

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
 You must wear the helmet of salvation

105
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
 And the sword of the Holy Spirit

106
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
 This is the way of God

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,960
 You must rely on the Holy Spirit

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
 To pray for you in all directions

109
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,960
 And to be vigilant for this

110
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
 Pray for the good

111
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,960
 Pray for me too

112
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
 Let me have the courage

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,960
 To speak out the praise of the Lord

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,960
 I have made a chain of the Lord's praise

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,960
 Let me speak out the praise of the Lord

116
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
 As I have done

117
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
 As you have prayed with the Father

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,960
 Let me pray for you

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,960
 We know that it is hard to live a good life

120
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
 By ourselves

121
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
 It is hard to live a life of the Holy Spirit

122
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
 I pray that the Lord will speak to us today

123
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
 And be with us

124
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
 Open our eyes of the Holy Spirit

125
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
 Let us see the true truth

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
 Let us live the truth

127
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
 By relying on the Holy Spirit

128
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
 Let us pray in the name of Jesus Christ

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
 Amen

130
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,960
 Let me talk a little bit about the simple background of the book of Ephesians

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
 There are six chapters in the book of Ephesians

132
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,920
 The first chapter is about a man who believes in Jesus

133
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 And has a new identity

134
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
 The fourth and sixth chapters are about

135
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
 A new man with a new identity

136
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
 What should be his life behavior?

137
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
 It should be different

138
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
 The sixth chapter we just read

139
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
 The tenth chapter is about

140
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
 There are verses that say

141
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,920
 "From now on"

142
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
 A man who believes in the Lord

143
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
 Has a new identity

144
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
 From now on

145
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,920
 He should rely on the Lord to be strong

146
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
 To be strong

147
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
 According to the original text

148
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 It is a passive order

149
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
 And the current situation

150
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
 What does it mean?

151
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
 It means that the believer

152
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
 Does not rely on himself to be strong

153
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
 He should rely on God to be strong

154
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
 And not only once

155
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
 It has a continuous meaning

156
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
 He should constantly rely on God

157
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
 Why is it so emphasized?

158
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
 After believing in the Lord

159
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
 We should rely on God

160
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
 Because the believer is facing

161
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,920
 A conflict

162
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
 Our opponent

163
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
 Or our enemy

164
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
 Is not a person

165
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
 But a devil in the spirit world

166
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
 The Bible describes

167
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
 The one who is in charge

168
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 Who is in power

169
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,920
 Who controls the dark world

170
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
 And the devil in the spirit world

171
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,920
 It is a supernatural existence

172
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
 The area they control

173
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
 Is the world on earth

174
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
 Yes

175
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,920
 It must be

176
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,920
 It is the world on earth

177
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
 Especially in the aspect of sin

178
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
 And worshiping idols

179
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
 I am not talking about K-pop idols

180
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
 The fake gods

181
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
 They are behind them

182
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 Controlling them

183
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,920
 Controlling them in the dark force

184
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
 So it is not by ourselves

185
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,920
 We can defeat the devil

186
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
 Although the devil

187
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
 Or the evil spirit

188
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
 Is very powerful

189
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,920
 But it will not appear casually

190
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
 To be honest

191
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
 If the devil or evil spirit

192
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,920
 Appears in front of us

193
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
 We will be very scared

194
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
 But I think we will

195
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
 Rely on God more

196
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
 Because it is very real

197
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
 Appears in front of us

198
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,920
 But it is very cunning

199
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
 The devil will not use his knife and gun

200
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 As the saying goes

201
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
 It is hard to defend against the dark force

202
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
 But it is very cunning

203
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,920
 When we are not aware

204
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 It will set traps for us

205
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
 To make us fall into the trap

206
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
 We may not even

207
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,920
 Realize the existence of the devil

208
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
 Because the devil

209
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,920
 Has been living in this world longer than us

210
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
 He knows that

211
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
 Directly showing up

212
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
 And threatening us

213
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
 Will not work

214
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
 We will have to be more sure

215
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
 Of the truth of God

216
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 More sure

217
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
 That we need to rely on God

218
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,920
 But he may hide

219
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,920
 In the so-called feng shui

220
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
 In the constellation and the book

221
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
 In those things

222
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
 Through these processes

223
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
 We may gain some benefits

224
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
 And predict the future

225
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
 We may not realize it

226
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
 But we will believe in it

227
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
 I am serious

228
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,920
 Have you seen the constellation?

229
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
 Have you played the tower cards?

230
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
 I am serious

231
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
 I heard that young people

232
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
 Don't know that

233
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
 These things are not supposed to be played

234
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,920
 They may try to predict their future

235
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
 But it is not

236
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 These are all the tricks of the devil

237
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,920
 The devil will not notice

238
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
 And set traps for us

239
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
 To make us fall into the trap

240
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
 So we need to be more sure

241
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
 Not rely on ourselves

242
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
 But rely on God

243
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,920
 We need to wear the full-armor

244
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
 The full-armor is called

245
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
 The whole arm of God

246
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,880
 The whole arm of God

247
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
 The whole arm of God

248
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 For us to wear

249
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
 The full-armor is used

250
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,880
 To resist the devil

251
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 In the 11th and 13th chapters

252
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
 It is said that we need to resist the devil

253
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
 And to be able to stand

254
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
 It is interesting

255
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 The word "resist"

256
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
 Is the same word as "stand"

257
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
 In the 13th chapter

258
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
 Yes

259
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
 What does it mean?

260
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 It means that we need to rely on God

261
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
 To stand steadily

262
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,840
 Not to win

263
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
 Not to defeat the devil

264
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
 Because we cannot defeat the devil

265
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
 Only God can defeat the devil

266
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
 But we can rely on God

267
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
 To stand steadily

268
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
 And not fall into the trap

269
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
 As a believer

270
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 I think we want to live a life of the Lord

271
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
 We want our life

272
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
 Our life to be filled with the joy of God

273
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
 But why sometimes it does not work?

274
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
 We always fall weakly

275
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
 It is because we are facing a battle of the Lord

276
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,800
 We need to recognize our enemy

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
 Who is our enemy?

278
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 Look at the person next to me

279
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 Yes, it is not him

280
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
 Our enemy

281
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
 Is Satan

282
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
 It is the evil spirit

283
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
 Do you know?

284
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 Yes

285
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
 The devil is the weakest point of all workers

286
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 Yes

287
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 It keeps us away from God

288
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 Most importantly

289
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 It is not aware of the fact that we are leaving God

290
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,800
 So we need to rely on God

291
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 But sometimes

292
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,800
 We do not understand the spiritual growth

293
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 Why?

294
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 Because we are used to

295
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Rely on our eyes

296
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
 It is practical to see with our eyes

297
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
 I am from the previous generation

298
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 I am definitely from the previous generation

299
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 I am not from the second generation

300
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 My parents are all worshipping God

301
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 They are worshipping idols

302
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 Worshipping false gods

303
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
 I have a landlord at home

304
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,800
 I worship the landlord

305
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 I also worship God

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 I did not believe in Jesus

307
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 I asked my mother

308
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
 Who is the God I worship?

309
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
 She said

310
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
 "It does not matter

311
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 It is just a worship of God"

312
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
 She could not answer me

313
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
 I remember when I was young

314
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 I used to go to the temple to ask for an autograph

315
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 I do not know if you know

316
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 There are two types of autographs

317
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 The upper one is good

318
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 The lower one is bad

319
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 It is not easy

320
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,800
 I remember when I asked for an autograph

321
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 I was sincere

322
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 If I could get the lower one

323
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
 What would you do?

324
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 I would put it back

325
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
 I am like this

326
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
 I am like this

327
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 When I did not believe in God

328
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
 I did superstitions

329
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 But I found that

330
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
 You also do superstitions

331
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 For example

332
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
 How to cut a cake?

333
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 Do not cut it to the bottom

334
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
 Right?

335
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,800
 You can't cut it to the bottom

336
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 Right?

337
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 (Laughter)

338
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 So there is no problem with the bottom

339
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 It is just a superstition

340
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 (Laughter)

341
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 When you say something

342
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
 That does not sound good

343
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
 You will say

344
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 "Touch wood"

345
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 No, it is iron

346
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
 (Laughter)

347
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 You are the new generation

348
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 You also have superstitions

349
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 Yes, really

350
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
 I was like this when I was young

351
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,800
 I had contact with idols

352
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 I had contact with evil spirits

353
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,800
 Even when I was a monk

354
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 I had experienced

355
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 The interference of the spirit world

356
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 I used to worship idols when I was young

357
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 I went to many temples

358
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 To worship gods

359
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
 I had many contact with the spirit world

360
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
 Even when I was a Christian

361
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
 I had experienced the interference of the spirit world

362
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
 I tried to sleep

363
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,760
 I was afraid

364
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 I was afraid

365
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
 I was afraid that I would cover my ears

366
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
 (Laughter)

367
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
 I tried to sleep

368
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
 I could not move

369
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
 I was rational

370
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
 It was a psychological effect

371
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
 I tried to close my eyes

372
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
 I could not close my eyes

373
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
 I could not move

374
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
 I was afraid

375
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,760
 When I was young

376
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 I was not in the "Yin and Fung" church

377
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
 I was in another church

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
 They taught me very quickly

379
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
 If you encounter evil spirits

380
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,760
 Remember to run away in Jesus' name

381
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
 I ran away in Jesus' name

382
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
 I could not move

383
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
 I was afraid

384
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
 They even talked to me

385
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
 I was very nervous

386
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
 There was a man talking to me

387
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
 I said, "Run away in Jesus' name"

388
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
 He talked to me

389
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
 He said, "Jesus, I know him"

390
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,760
 I was very afraid

391
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
 I could not move

392
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
 It was very interesting

393
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
 I do not know why

394
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
 Suddenly, a song came to my mind

395
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,760
 A poem came to my mind

396
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,760
 I sang this poem in primary school

397
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
 I sang this poem for 6 years

398
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
 I grew up in a Catholic school

399
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
 Can you guess what song I sang?

400
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
 You know it, Xiao Feng?

401
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,760
 (Laughter)

402
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
 Stop kidding

403
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
 What is it?

404
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
 My poem is called "This is the world of the rich"

405
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 I sang this poem for 6 years

406
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
 Suddenly, a poem came to my mind

407
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,760
 "This is the world of the rich"

408
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 I fell asleep

409
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
 I was relaxed

410
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
 Sister, I do not want to scare you

411
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
 I do not want to scare you

412
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
 I want to tell you that

413
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
 the spiritual world is very real

414
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
 I do not expect you to encounter this

415
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
 Do not worry

416
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
 We who belong to God

417
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
 have God's protection

418
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
 Do not worry

419
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
 In the end, the devil will leave me

420
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
 and leave you

421
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
 God will protect you

422
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
 But really

423
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
 Sister, the spiritual world is very real

424
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 Of course, the devil will not use such a cheap trick

425
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
 like I did in the past

426
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,760
 I was scared and became a propagandist

427
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 (Laughter)

428
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,760
 He will not use such a trick to scare you

429
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
 Because he knows it will not work

430
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
 It may even have a counter effect

431
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
 Maybe he is more faithful

432
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
 God is very real

433
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
 But really

434
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,760
 The devil may use other things to lure us

435
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
 to make us fall into weakness

436
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
 and make us leave God

437
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,760
 We need to recognize who our enemy is

438
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
 We need to use the right weapon to deal with him

439
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
 Okay

440
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
 Use the right weapon

441
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
 What weapon?

442
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,760
 Let's continue to look at the scripture below

443
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
 What is in this weapon?

444
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
 Let's look at the 14th chapter

445
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 It appears again

446
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
 It is about the balance

447
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
 The balance in the 14th chapter

448
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 is the same as in the 11th and 13th chapters

449
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
 So it emphasizes that we must stand firm

450
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,760
 and not be hit by the devil

451
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,760
 What does this weapon include?

452
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,760
 It includes the truth

453
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
 The truth is about the gospel

454
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 and the teaching of the Bible

455
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 The word "truth" means to be ready

456
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 It means to be ready

457
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,760
 Are you familiar with the Bible?

458
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
 Are you ready to tell people about the Bible?

459
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 Or are you just a half bottle of water?

460
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,760
 Use justice as a shield

461
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 It means we need to be a faithful

462
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
 and righteous person

463
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 But today

464
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,760
 we need to show our righteousness

465
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,760
 Use peace and harmony as a bridge

466
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,760
 This sentence is from the Old Testament

467
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
 It says we need to have a job of preaching

468
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
 We need to take the initiative

469
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,760
 to share the content of the gospel

470
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
 "Believe and act as a shield

471
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
 to wipe out all the evil"

472
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,760
 A rocket will cause harm to the enemy

473
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,760
 and even disturb the people

474
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
 But it may not be fatal

475
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
 The same goes for the devil

476
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,760
 The devil may not give us a fatal blow

477
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
 but it may disturb our faith

478
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
 and our vigilance

479
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
 So we need to resist with faith

480
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Also, wear a helmet of salvation

481
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
 It is very important

482
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,760
 We are saved today

483
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 No one can condemn us

484
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
 We will not go to hell

485
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
 We are already saved in the presence of God

486
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
 This is very important

487
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
 The sword of the Holy Spirit is the way of God

488
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
 The Bible is the way of God

489
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,760
 I have talked about this military uniform

490
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,760
 You may have heard of it since you were a child

491
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
 Have you noticed

492
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,760
 the special feature of this uniform?

493
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
 It is often used as a defensive weapon

494
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
 It is not very aggressive

495
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,760
 Even the sword of the Holy Spirit

496
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
 is a word of God

497
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
 It reminds me of Jesus

498
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
 when he was tested

499
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
 He used the word of God

500
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
 to defeat the devil

501
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,760
 It seems that this military uniform

502
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
 is not for close combat

503
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
 but for defensive

504
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
 Yes

505
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
 As believers

506
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
 we need to know the truth

507
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
 Is it safe?

508
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
 Is it well-known?

509
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,760
 Can we keep the faith?

510
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
 Can we distinguish

511
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
 which is the word of God

512
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
 which is the will of God

513
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
 which is the trick of the devil

514
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,760
 so that we will not fall into the trap of the devil

515
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,760
 Our life and actions

516
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
 can only come out of the Christian style

517
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
 and the gospel

518
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
 As I said

519
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
 the devil is very smart

520
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
 He will not show up to scare us

521
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,760
 but to attack our weak spot

522
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
 and make us fall from God

523
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,760
 I heard a young man say

524
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,760
 why do I always pray

525
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
 but God does not listen to me

526
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
 and I am still in a lot of trouble

527
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,760
 But the person next to me

528
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
 or the people I do not believe in

529
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
 may live a better life than me

530
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,760
 Should I still keep the faith?

531
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,760
 Do I really believe that God exists?

532
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,760
 I don't know if you feel the same

533
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
 When something unpleasant

534
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
 happens in our life

535
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
 we start to question God

536
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
 Is God real?

537
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
 Does God love me?

538
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
 Does prayer work?

539
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
 Is this faith possible?

540
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
 Just now

541
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
 when DSC released the list

542
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
 Sister, I don't know how many of you

543
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
 have faced DSC and released the list

544
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
 When you see the results

545
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
 do you question God?

546
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,760
 God, why don't you bless me?

547
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
 Why did my Chinese break?

548
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
 Will it happen?

549
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 Sometimes the devil uses these situations

550
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
 to make us question

551
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
 God, are you real?

552
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 God, do you love me?

553
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
 The devil uses these situations

554
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,760
 to make us question God

555
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
 Or maybe

556
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 today

557
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
 I know many of you are busy

558
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
 in the service

559
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,760
 You are busy in the service

560
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 but the devil can test us

561
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
 in the service

562
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
 Maybe you are busy

563
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
 in the service

564
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
 You are the group leader

565
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
 You are the senior mentor

566
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
 You are the first camp leader

567
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
 You are the first camp leader

568
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
 You are the one who went to Cambodia

569
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
 You are the one who went to Taiwan

570
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
 You are the one who went to the local school

571
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
 You should not be the one

572
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
 You met the local school in Taiwan

573
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
 Are you really busy?

574
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,760
 You are really busy in the service

575
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
 but you do not forget

576
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
 that there are more important things

577
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
 than the service

578
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 Some people say

579
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
 in the service

580
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 you interact with people

581
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
 there are many conflicts

582
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
 which make you

583
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
 have many friction with the senior mentors

584
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
 which hurts your faith

585
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
 and your faith

586
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
 You even have a broken relationship

587
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
 with the group

588
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
 Yes

589
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
 Not necessarily in the church

590
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,760
 but in the church

591
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
 the devil can not test you

592
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
 in the church

593
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
 Maybe the devil is testing us

594
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
 with these things

595
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
 and hurting our faith

596
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
 and destroying our

597
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
 relationship with the faith

598
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,760
 Jesus said

599
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
 Satan will get you

600
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
 Next passage

601
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
 Next passage

602
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
 Next PowerPoint, please

603
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,760
 He said

604
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,800
 He will get you like a piece of tin

605
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,760
 What does it mean?

606
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 It means he will get you

607
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
 in a simple way

608
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
 Yes

609
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
 It is true

610
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
 So sisters

611
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
 you should wear the uniform

612
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
 and stand up straight

613
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
 to distinguish

614
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
 which is the voice of the devil

615
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
 and which is the voice of God

616
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
 which is the voice of the Bible

617
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
 How does God look at me?

618
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
 How does God look at me?

619
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
 What does God want me to do?

620
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
 Yes

621
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
 God does not want me

622
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,760
 to lose my faith

623
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
 God does not want me

624
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
 to fail in my studies

625
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
 God does not want me

626
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
 to destroy my relationship

627
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
 with others

628
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
 God does not want me

629
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
 to be at odds

630
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 with you

631
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 God does not want me

632
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
 to be away from the group

633
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
 or the faith

634
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
 You may encounter

635
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
 something unintentional

636
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
 We should distinguish

637
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
 between the two

638
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 The word "village"

639
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
 in the word "village"

640
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 refers to a village

641
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,760
 It means that you will not be able to take it off

642
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
 when you wear it

643
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
 It means that you will not be able to

644
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 take it off

645
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
 when you wear it

646
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
 when it is cold

647
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
 or when it is hot

648
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
 or when you wear a jacket

649
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
 It does not mean that

650
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
 You will not be able to take it off

651
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
 when you wear it

652
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 We are not

653
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
 wearing the uniform

654
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
 as a choice

655
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
 We are not

656
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 listening to God's words

657
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
 as a choice

658
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,760
 You may ask

659
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
 "I do not have to wear

660
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
 the uniform all the time

661
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
 I am not that weak

662
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
 I do not fall into

663
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
 the trap of the devil

664
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
 I do not lose my confidence

665
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
 I do not doubt God

666
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
 If you have the chance

667
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
 to read the second chapter

668
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
 the first chapter

669
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 In the second to the third chapter

670
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
 it says

671
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
 "When"

672
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 "When"

673
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
 means when we do not believe in God

674
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
 "you will live

675
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
 in sin again

676
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,720
 and will be a leader

677
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
 in the world

678
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 who is the devil

679
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
 who is now working in the hearts of the wicked

680
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
 We have also lived

681
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 in their midst

682
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
 indulging in the lust of flesh

683
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 and doing what the flesh

684
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
 and the thoughts of the heart

685
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
 do, like others

686
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
 and we will be

687
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
 the ones who are punished

688
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
 What is it saying?

689
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,720
 Paul reminds us

690
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
 that when we do not believe in God

691
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,720
 we like those lives

692
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,720
 we like those criminal lives

693
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,720
 we like the test of the devil

694
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,720
 we like to do what we do

695
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 We are used to it

696
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,720
 So, the bad things

697
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
 falling into the trap of the devil

698
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
 are just things that happen

699
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
 casually

700
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
 Doing bad things

701
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
 is more comfortable for us

702
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
 Because before we believe in God

703
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 we are used to

704
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
 those lives

705
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,720
 Doing things that do not

706
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
 conform to God's will

707
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
 and offending God

708
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 is more comfortable for us

709
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 So, we need to remind ourselves

710
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
 to wear this uniform

711
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,720
 and not take it off

712
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
 Sisters

713
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
 We need to discern the voice of the devil

714
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
 and resist the test of the devil

715
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
 We need to wear this uniform

716
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
 not according to our preferences

717
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
 but wear it often

718
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
 so that we can

719
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,720
 resist the test of the devil

720
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
 and make our lives

721
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,720
 stand steadily

722
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
 At last

723
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
 the 18th to 20th verses

724
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
 It talks about prayer

725
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
 According to the structure of the original text

726
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 what is it saying?

727
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
 Prayer has two purposes

728
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 The first purpose is

729
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 to make me have the ability

730
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
 to speak openly

731
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
 and to be proud of my recitation

732
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 The second purpose is

733
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
 to make me be able to

734
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 speak out openly

735
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
 according to my duty

736
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,720
 Actually, these two purposes

737
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
 are similar

738
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
 Simply speaking

739
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
 it is related to the recitation

740
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
 We need to do a good job

741
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
 in the recitation

742
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
 But to do a good job

743
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
 in the recitation

744
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 it is important for many people

745
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
 to believe in Jesus

746
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
 and to pray

747
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
 Paul saw that

748
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,720
 he needed to pray for him

749
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
 Why did he need to pray for Paul?

750
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
 Because at that time

751
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
 when Paul was writing this letter

752
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
 he was in prison

753
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
 He was arrested

754
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
 He was in prison

755
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
 He could not freely

756
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,720
 preach the gospel

757
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,720
 He hoped to be released earlier

758
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
 If you are familiar with the Bible

759
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
 you will know that

760
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
 Paul was very powerful

761
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
 Although he was in prison

762
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
 he continued to preach the gospel

763
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
 to the soldiers and the prisoners

764
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
 So Paul prayed for his disciples

765
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
 Even if he was in prison

766
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 he hoped he could

767
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 preach the gospel

768
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
 and make people believe in Jesus

769
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
 But it is very special

770
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
 Paul not only asked people

771
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
 to pray for him

772
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
 Paul also said

773
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
 to pray for the disciples

774
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,720
 including him and me

775
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 I guess

776
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
 the disciples were worried

777
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
 about Paul

778
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
 whether he was in prison

779
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
 or something happened

780
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
 whether he was sick

781
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
 They prayed for the disciples

782
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
 Maybe the disciples

783
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
 lost their faith

784
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 Paul was a great

785
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
 missionary

786
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
 a great man

787
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
 He was in prison

788
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
 and suffered

789
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
 It was hurting the disciples' faith

790
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 So they prayed for the disciples

791
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
 not to lose their faith

792
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 because of Paul's imprisonment

793
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,680
 But I believe

794
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
 what is more important

795
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
 is that the disciples

796
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,680
 need to preach the gospel

797
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 because preaching the gospel

798
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,680
 is not Paul's sole responsibility

799
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
 All the disciples

800
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
 are the messengers of the gospel

801
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
 We are all responsible

802
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
 So we need to do

803
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
 this kind of work

804
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
 But to do this kind of work

805
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
 we need the help of the Holy Spirit

806
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
 It is not just me praying for the disciples

807
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,680
 I pray for them to be strong and strong

808
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
 to be rich

809
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,680
 to make them believe in Jesus

810
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
 It is not just me

811
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
 to convince them

812
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
 to repent and believe in the gospel

813
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 It is the Holy Spirit

814
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,680
 working in their hearts

815
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
 The Holy Spirit is God

816
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
 No matter what we say

817
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,680
 we cannot leave God

818
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,680
 We cannot not rely on God

819
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
 Prayer is very important

820
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,680
 Prayer is a humble heart

821
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,680
 We need to pray to God

822
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
 to help us

823
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
 "God, I cannot do this

824
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
 Please help me"

825
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
 It is a humble heart

826
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
 to pray to God for help

827
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
 The gospel is not

828
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
 a personal gift

829
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
 It is a success

830
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
 because of the power of the gospel

831
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
 What is more important

832
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
 is the work of the Holy Spirit

833
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
 in people's hearts

834
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
 I would like to share

835
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
 a story about the gospel

836
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
 with you

837
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,680
 Once, a brother

838
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
 whose father was sick

839
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,680
 and was admitted to the hospital

840
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,680
 He asked me to preach the gospel

841
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
 This brother

842
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,680
 had believed in the gospel for more than 10 years

843
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
 He was holding a lamp

844
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
 and was praying

845
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
 "Hail to the Lord, the Lord is with us"

846
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
 Do you know this?

847
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
 I do not know

848
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
 I always think you are the second generation

849
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
 You do not understand the gospel

850
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
 Or

851
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,680
 "Please put a Hello Kitty here"

852
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
 No, it is the "Cat of God"

853
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
 (Laughter)

854
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
 "Please put it there"

855
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

856
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

857
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

858
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

859
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

860
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

861
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

862
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

863
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

864
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

865
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

866
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

867
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

868
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

869
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

870
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

871
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

872
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

873
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

874
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

875
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

876
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

877
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
 "I have a bad luck today"

878
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,640
 "It's our first time meeting"

879
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
 "Don't be so aggressive"

880
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
 "Let's talk first"

881
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
 "Let's care about Uncle"

882
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
 "I remember when I left"

883
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
 "I told Uncle"

884
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 "Uncle, let me pray for you"

885
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
 "Okay, Uncle"

886
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
 "I'm willing to pray"

887
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
 "But suddenly"

888
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,640
 "Auntie took out a Buddha's mouth"

889
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
 "You wear it first"

890
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
 "Wear the Buddha's mouth first"

891
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
 "I'm praying"

892
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
 "But you wear the Buddha's mouth"

893
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
 "Do you understand?"

894
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
 "At that moment, I immediately felt"

895
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
 "Wow, it's really a battle of the soul"

896
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,640
 "It's good"

897
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 "Auntie took out the Buddha's mouth"

898
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
 "Auntie immediately came out"

899
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
 "Don't do that, Grandma"

900
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
 "Let's put the Buddha's mouth down first"

901
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,640
 "Let's pray first"

902
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
 "It's good, she put the Buddha's mouth down"

903
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
 "I prayed for Uncle"

904
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
 "After praying"

905
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
 "I heard Uncle"

906
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
 "talking to me in Amman"

907
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
 "But it was very quiet"

908
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
 "Then a few days later"

909
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,640
 "Another missionary"

910
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
 "visited Uncle"

911
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
 "It was very amazing"

912
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,600
 "The missionary said"

913
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
 "That day, Uncle visited"

914
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
 "not me, another missionary"

915
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 "A retired missionary"

916
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
 "Uncle was very energetic"

917
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
 "Very energetic"

918
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 "He was willing to listen to the recitation"

919
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 "He listened to the entire recitation"

920
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
 "He even decided to believe in God"

921
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 "I was very grateful"

922
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
 "Brother told me"

923
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 "Brother said, "I'm very grateful"

924
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
 "A few days later, this retired missionary"

925
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
 "came to listen to the recitation with my father"

926
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 "He decided to believe in God"

927
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 "He said, "Don't do that"

928
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 "Hurry up"

929
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
 "I immediately said, "How about this"

930
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,600
 "I will do the ceremony with him"

931
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,600
 "Uncle's physical condition was not good"

932
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 "A few days later"

933
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,600
 "I went up to do the ceremony with him"

934
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
 "It was the second time I met Uncle"

935
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,600
 "I felt that Uncle's spirit was much worse"

936
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
 "Even his response and voice were much weaker"

937
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
 "But I was very grateful"

938
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
 "Every time I asked him"

939
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
 "Did you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior?"

940
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
 "His answer was very clear"

941
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
 "I asked him"

942
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
 "Yes, do you believe that Jesus"

943
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,600
 "has been very clearly expressed in your life?"

944
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
 "I did the ceremony for him"

945
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 "After the ceremony"

946
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
 "we prayed together"

947
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
 "We did not take out the Buddha's name this time"

948
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
 "We prayed together"

949
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
 "When we prayed together"

950
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
 "Uncle's voice was very loud"

951
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
 "He said, "Amen"

952
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
 "All his relatives heard it"

953
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 "What I want to say is"

954
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
 "Sister, it is true"

955
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,600
 "A person believes in Jesus Christ is God's work"

956
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
 "We should pray to God"

957
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,600
 "God will change people in our lives"
