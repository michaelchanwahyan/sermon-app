1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
 When I saw Woody, I thought he was holding a gold medal

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,640
 to thank the people around him

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,740
 But I'm really grateful

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,480
 to hear about the growth of their faith

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
 Sister Ding, I don't know what you think

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,620
 after hearing their story

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,280
 This year is very special

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,260
 I think if you share it with them

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,820
 they will know for sure

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,000
 As they said

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,760
 they are not the sisters who serve in the Youth Ministry

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:44,100
 They go to camp and to the short-term school

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,980
 They have different experiences and different growth

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,020
 But after hearing their stories

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,420
 Sister Ding, I want to ask you

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,980
 Give you five seconds to think

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,620
 After this summer vacation

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,960
 or looking back at your faith a year ago

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,060
 your faith life

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,500
 to this moment

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,060
 is there any difference?

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,600
 Your relationship with God

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,340
 your relationship with the team

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,240
 or even your faith in life

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,500
 Give you five seconds to think

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,620
 Is there any difference?

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,720
 Five seconds should be enough

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,820
 I don't know what you think

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,480
 This year's theme is

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,120
 Transform Our Lives Going for Christ

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,660
 I don't know how much of your life

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,560
 you have implemented

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,800
 the theme of this year

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,100
 But I think these two weeks

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,400
 after participating in different activities

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,540
 we have done some reviews

37
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,680
 to think about how you are doing this summer

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,380
 We also have an experience

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,980
 We think that this summer

40
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,620
 we feel that many sisters in the Youth Ministry

41
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,260
 your spirit, your faith

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,560
 and your commitment are back

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,400
 You are willing to do

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,560
 and try

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
 Even in the camp

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,060
 you are willing to explore more

47
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,600
 to ask more about what faith is

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,040
 This year, in the coming new year

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,000
 we will have a new theme

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,740
 In fact, the worship of the church

51
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,340
 is also the direction of our new theme

52
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,980
 This year's new direction

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,240
 we want to do one thing

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,980
 to show God's way

55
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,120
 to walk into the corner of the world

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,420
 The theme of today's sermon is

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,520
 Alive in Christ, Let's Go and Shine

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,060
 This is what we want to do

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,700
 with you in the Youth Ministry in the new year

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,860
 I think in the new year

61
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,540
 I want to take you one step further

62
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,700
 to see what we have done

63
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,540
 In the past two years

64
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,900
 we have done many different short sermons

65
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,640
 and many different services

66
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,280
 to explore faith

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,380
 But this year, I really want to

68
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,280
 through the sermon of the Church of Christ

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,920
 to broaden your vision of faith

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,120
 I think in the past few years

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,420
 we have often talked to you about

72
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,720
 life growth, life transformation

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 We need to experience God more

74
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,520
 We will continue to

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,600
 experience and explore these with you

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,400
 But I think this year

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,060
 I want to take one step further

78
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,300
 to show that our faith

79
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,040
 is not just about our own lives

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,540
 but also to broaden your vision of faith

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,040
 It turns out that

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,540
 our faith is not just about ourselves

83
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,140
 It turns out that our faith has many things

84
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,320
 that God's perspective can be so broad

85
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,720
 Today, I want to share with you

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,520
 the 60 chapters of the New Testament

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,560
 the 60 chapters of the New Testament

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,060
 and see how the New Testament

89
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,360
 will lead us to this year's theme

90
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,900
 Let's talk about the background of the New Testament

91
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,400
 There are 66 chapters in the New Testament

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,540
 People usually divide the 66 chapters into three parts

93
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,740
 The 60 chapters we are going to look at today

94
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,080
 are in the third part

95
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,220
 The third part of the New Testament

96
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
 is very special

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,120
 It has a very important theme

98
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,980
 It only talks about the message of salvation

99
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,980
 It doesn't talk about the judgment

100
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,560
 or other messages

101
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,160
 The 62 chapters

102
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,960
 are the very core message of the third part

103
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,700
 It talks about the scene

104
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,700
 when Jerusalem was rebuilt

105
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,500
 and glorified

106
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,900
 and even the rebuilding of the temple

107
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,780
 When we look at the 60 chapters today

108
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,120
 there are similarities with the 59 chapters

109
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,280
 because there are many similar words

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,280
 such as glory, salvation, justice, light

111
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,220
 The 59 chapters are about

112
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,900
 the world without salvation or justice

113
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,300
 Only God can bring these things out

114
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,460
 It also talks about the coming of the Messiah

115
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,140
 and the people's being a symbol of justice

116
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,900
 and other themes

117
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,740
 Today, we are going to look at only three chapters

118
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,860
 These three chapters are the main theme

119
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,960
 of the whole 60 chapters

120
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,160
 Let's read the three chapters together

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
 Let's read the 60 chapters of the New Testament

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,700
 Chapter 1-3

123
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,300
 Ready?

124
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,500
 "Behold, the light is coming,

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,900
 and the glory of the Lord is coming to you.

126
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,640
 See, the darkness covers the earth,

127
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,600
 and the darkness covers the people.

128
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,680
 The Lord is coming, and the glory of the Lord is coming to you.

129
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,880
 The glory of the Lord is coming to you.

130
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,580
 The glory of the Lord is coming to you."

131
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,860
 You may be familiar with this song

132
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,020
 because you often sing this song

133
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,260
 Before we enter the scripture

134
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,460
 let's pray together

135
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,660
 Lord, lead us

136
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,400
 Let us be filled with your heart

137
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,260
 Let us let your words

138
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,800
 come to our lives

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,200
 Lord, lead us with your light

140
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,400
 Lead us in the new year

141
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,340
 Let us learn how to live in faith

142
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,840
 and how to live in life

143
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,580
 Lord, lead us

144
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,540
 Thank you, Lord, for your help

145
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,940
 Lord, bless us

146
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,620
 We have just read the three chapters

147
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,720
 In the three chapters

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,820
 we may ask a question

149
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,960
 What are you referring to?

150
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,360
 In the third part of Isaiah

151
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
 we see that the "you"

152
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,700
 is referring to the rock

153
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,940
 and to Jerusalem

154
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,940
 This is a call to the rock

155
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,040
 The rock is to shine

156
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,280
 and to bring forth

157
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,640
 the reason why it should do so

158
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,880
 The light has come

159
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,880
 The glory of the Lord is coming to you

160
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,860
 We may ask, what is the light?

161
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,760
 The light is not coming from the rock

162
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,400
 but from God

163
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,660
 So the announcement is about

164
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,860
 God coming to the rock

165
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,040
 Then the next sentence is

166
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,980
 "The glory of the Lord is coming to you"

167
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,880
 We may ask, what is the meaning

168
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,620
 of "is coming to you"?

169
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,820
 The word "discover"

170
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,320
 is a meaning of rising

171
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,120
 This word is constantly used

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,220
 in the three chapters

173
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,060
 because the word "discover"

174
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,660
 is the same as "rise"

175
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,960
 It is like a scene

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,340
 when the sun rises

177
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,040
 and shines on the earth

178
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,880
 It is a similar scene

179
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,940
 Likewise, when we read this word

180
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,840
 we may focus on the word "glory"

181
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,380
 "Brother, I don't know what glory is"

182
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,480
 We often talk about glory

183
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 I don't know if you know what it is

184
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,880
 The word "glory"

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,220
 has a special meaning in Hebrew

186
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,220
 It refers to something that is important

187
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,760
 and real

188
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,600
 It usually refers to the glory of God

189
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,800
 or even the glory of God

190
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,700
 But this word, especially here

191
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,200
 is about God's appearance

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
 God's presence

193
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,080
 and even God's authority over His people

194
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,480
 So we see that this sentence

195
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,720
 is a message that is balanced

196
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,180
 God's presence is with Zion

197
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,620
 God wants to shine on Zion

198
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,520
 This announcement may seem far away

199
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,000
 to us who are reading this

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,700
 But it is very meaningful

201
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,900
 to the readers of the time

202
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
 Why?

203
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,600
 Because for the entire people of Israel

204
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
 when we look back at their entire experience

205
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,240
 what was the time when

206
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,080
 Jehovah's Witnesses and their glory

207
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,880
 were together?

208
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,080
 It was when they left Egypt

209
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,480
 and stayed in Mount Sinai

210
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,620
 Later, when their people developed

211
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,960
 when the king of Solomon went to build the temple

212
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,820
 at the time of the offering

213
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,160
 Jehovah's Witnesses were among them

214
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,060
 But when their people

215
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,000
 started to leave God

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,240
 different Bible records

217
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,040
 have Jehovah's Witnesses

218
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
 leaving Jerusalem

219
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
 Later, they went through the kingdom of the king

220
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,000
 and the city of Beelzebub

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,640
 and the city of Zeon

222
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,080
 and became a group of tyrants

223
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,680
 So when we talk about Jehovah's Witnesses

224
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,080
 and their glory

225
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,780
 what is important is that

226
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,620
 the entire people

227
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,920
 experienced a transformation

228
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,420
 and were resurrected

229
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,320
 What we see is that

230
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,160
 the people of Israel

231
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,560
 were connected to the nobles on earth

232
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
 and wanted to glorify themselves

233
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,800
 But the people were gone

234
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,600
 But Jehovah said

235
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,140
 that he wanted to come to Zeon

236
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,540
 to resurrect them

237
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,980
 I think for the readers of the time

238
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,320
 what they saw was

239
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,780
 that they were able to experience salvation

240
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,820
 and the king of the tribes

241
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,220
 was able to realize

242
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,420
 the promise Jehovah made to them

243
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,620
 I think what Jehovah is saying here

244
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,020
 is that the glory and light of Jehovah

245
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,800
 should be glorified in Zeon

246
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,160
 and be resurrected in the darkness of Zeon

247
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,200
 I think what Jehovah is saying here

248
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,240
 is that the people of Israel

249
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,000
 and the entire people

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,100
 were revived and experienced a transformation

251
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,900
 I think the book of Exodus is very special

252
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,440
 In addition to talking about the situation at the time

253
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,540
 it also represents the events of the New Testament

254
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,240
 We often hear about the New Testament

255
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
 I think that when the New Testament is written

256
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,580
 people can be able to shine a light on life

257
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,220
 through the light of Jesus Christ

258
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,820
 and also let people experience life's changes

259
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,960
 Similarly, after 2,000 years

260
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,520
 we are still here

261
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,000
 I think we are experiencing the same things

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,300
 The glory of God, the presence of God

263
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,940
 the light of God shining on our lives

264
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,640
 are all shared by people during the summer

265
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,980
 However, brothers and sisters

266
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,540
 when we look back at the summer

267
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,140
 we have watched the videos

268
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,920
 we have a lot of experiences

269
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,820
 in the short stories and the camp

270
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,780
 We have a lot of letters

271
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,180
 In the camp of the Great Zion

272
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,420
 we have a lot of different letters

273
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,360
 In the camp of the early days

274
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,900
 we made a sheep

275
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,500
 to shine a light on the world

276
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 There are a lot of different letters

277
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,300
 In the camp of the high school

278
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,600
 that house was destroyed

279
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,100
 There are a lot of different letters

280
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,040
 I think we have a lot of letters

281
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,880
 that are very special

282
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,780
 In the three camps this year

283
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,720
 there are a lot of letters

284
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,780
 with a lot of lights

285
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,460
 and different themes

286
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,120
 We say that we want to experience life's changes

287
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,060
 We want to experience the resurrection of the Holy Spirit

288
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,420
 We want to shine a light on the world

289
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,620
 But sometimes I think

290
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,400
 we experience these things every summer

291
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,900
 We have to shine a light for God

292
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,600
 We say this every year

293
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
 I want to ask you

294
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,980
 Is what you wrote in your letter

295
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,780
 the same as last year?

296
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,180
 Some people may think

297
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,940
 I write the same letter every year

298
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,180
 I said I would go to church this year

299
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,520
 but I didn't

300
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 What is it?

301
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,360
 It seems to be a slogan

302
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,520
 Or maybe in our faith

303
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,160
 there is a situation

304
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,860
 I named it

305
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,660
 This situation

306
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,200
 or we all have a fantasy

307
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,840
 about a summer vacation

308
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,700
 What is it?

309
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,380
 Let Dr. Fung explain

310
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,240
 This is the situation

311
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,740
 When we experience the summer vacation

312
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,640
 we feel like we are back

313
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,020
 We experience the presence of God

314
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,180
 and the changes of life

315
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,620
 We are grateful to God

316
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,180
 Next week we start school

317
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,420
 We start school

318
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,520
 I want to write in this letter

319
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,020
 I must be able to do this

320
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,960
 Then in November

321
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,740
 we enter stage 1

322
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,900
 We are very busy

323
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,860
 I study UT, midterm

324
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,640
 My life is very energetic

325
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,740
 I am exhausted

326
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,880
 I am very tired

327
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,040
 In December and January

328
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,540
 I start exams

329
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,080
 I have a lot to do

330
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,180
 I have to serve

331
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,920
 I can't do this

332
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,020
 I am a little burnt out

333
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,920
 I need to take a break

334
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,020
 We enter stage 2

335
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,860
 Stage 3

336
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,820
 January to June

337
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,920
 At this time

338
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,660
 my life is full of things to do

339
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,760
 The challenge of my faith is getting bigger

340
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,100
 I have a youth leader

341
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,300
 I have a lot to do

342
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,400
 It is like the summer vacation

343
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,360
 has been washed away by the current

344
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,780
 I think that for people with post-traumatic stress disorder

345
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,340
 they usually have a situation

346
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,820
 that before the summer vacation ends

347
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,180
 they will write

348
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,280
 As the care leader said last week

349
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,960
 we want to write a walking bible

350
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,760
 When we walk out

351
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,660
 we tell people what our faith is

352
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,260
 But in the end

353
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,700
 we become a walking dead

354
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,400
 But it is a very funny thing

355
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,600
 Or

356
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,360
 we are grateful to God's leadership

357
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,800
 When we come back next summer

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,000
 our walking dead will suddenly

359
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,640
 change us into a human

360
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,140
 and make us a walking bible in our faith

361
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,580
 Brothers and sisters

362
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,080
 I would like to ask you

363
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,060
 In the past few years

364
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,460
 have we been in this cycle?

365
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,200
 Brothers and sisters

366
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,700
 I think our faith life is really endless

367
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,400
 In the new year

368
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,000
 I would like to learn something from you

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,640
 We have to be alive in Christ

370
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,600
 Or we have to see

371
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,580
 what we experience in the summer vacation

372
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,620
 When we are going to do it

373
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,820
 we have to have a mindset

374
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,320
 that what we experience

375
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,780
 what we learn to do

376
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,980
 those abilities come from God

377
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,120
 When we learn to do something

378
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,220
 we have to remember that

379
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,000
 God gives us the ability to do what we want

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,360
 God controls our life

381
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,060
 so that we can know how to live out

382
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,340
 what we write

383
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,880
 As the Bible says

384
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,740
 the reason why John was able to shine

385
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,940
 was not because of himself

386
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,840
 but because of the presence of Jesus

387
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,980
 and the power of God

388
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,980
 Likewise, our life has to be illuminated

389
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,520
 At least we have to learn one thing

390
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,660
 Our life has to be able to keep alive in Christ

391
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,960
 We have to let this light

392
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,200
 keep shining in our lives

393
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
 You know, I think this light

394
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,700
 is not a flash light

395
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,940
 Wow

396
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,000
 I think this light

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,480
 is not a flash light in the summer vacation

398
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,380
 This light is a long-lasting spotlight

399
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,520
 to shine on our lives

400
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,880
 Brothers and sisters

401
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,980
 Let's learn together

402
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,460
 What we learn is

403
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,120
 we learn to be alive in Christ

404
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,160
 We don't become a walking dead

405
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,940
 in November

406
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,860
 What we see is

407
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,740
 the light of our lives

408
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,260
 comes from God

409
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,800
 I think this light

410
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,700
 is a constant light that shines on our lives

411
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,500
 Its glory and presence

412
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,600
 are always with our lives

413
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,780
 Likewise, our lives

414
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,780
 are under God's control

415
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,280
 So, are we willing to continue

416
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,240
 learning and doing this?

417
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,580
 This is the first part

418
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,980
 I want to share with you this year

419
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,120
 The second part

420
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,560
 I think this light

421
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,320
 is not just a flash light

422
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,120
 When we look at the Bible

423
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,000
 when John said to rise up

424
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,160
 to restore the rock

425
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,460
 it is not just a moment

426
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,800
 When we look at the Bible

427
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
 we see the first verse

428
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,240
 has two verbs

429
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
 "to rise up and shine"

430
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,540
 This is a commandment

431
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,920
 It means that the rock

432
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,340
 and the whole nation

433
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,320
 have a mission to respond

434
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,760
 "to rise up and shine"

435
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,020
 In English, it is "arise and shine"

436
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,260
 This word has a similar meaning

437
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,800
 It is like a mother

438
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,600
 calling a sleeping baby

439
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,060
 Likewise, John says

440
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,200
 to awaken a sleeping rock

441
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
 "You have to rise up and respond"

442
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,440
 What is the response?

443
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
 When we look at the second verse

444
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,320
 there is a link

445
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
 In the second verse

446
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,980
 the word "to rise up" is not there

447
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,620
 but in the original text

448
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,680
 there is a word "because"

449
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,260
 It means that John said

450
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,260
 to shine the rock

451
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
 there is a reason

452
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,260
 When we look at the third verse

453
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,800
 we see a very important contrast

454
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
 It is a big theme

455
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,600
 Light and darkness

456
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,740
 John said that the earth is dark

457
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,680
 and the people are covered by darkness

458
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,440
 This scene is like

459
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,020
 the blindfold game

460
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,720
 where you can't see anything

461
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,620
 The word "darkness"

462
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,520
 also means "death"

463
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,220
 in the Bible

464
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,160
 "No signs"

465
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,320
 "A dead end"

466
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
 This is the scene

467
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,820
 that we are trying to imagine

468
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,400
 Everything is dark

469
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,040
 except for a place called Zion

470
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,100
 where there is a sudden glow

471
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,800
 The surrounding area is dark

472
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,500
 and the people are not blind

473
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,380
 They are even covered by darkness

474
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,340
 When we look at this scene

475
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,880
 if you are familiar with the Bible

476
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,280
 you might think of a scene

477
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,480
 When the Egyptians went to Egypt

478
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,560
 to experience the flood

479
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,420
 the land was dark

480
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,660
 Only the houses of the Egyptians

481
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,200
 had light

482
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
 It is a similar scene

483
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,000
 But I think Isaiah

484
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
 did not just want to express the situation

485
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,140
 In the second verse

486
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,880
 the word "to rise up" is there

487
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,760
 The word is used to

488
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,880
 wake up the people of Zion

489
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,280
 and the readers of the Bible

490
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
 What is it saying?

491
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,560
 "Were you not in the darkness before?"

492
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 "Now the Lord is calling you"

493
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,200
 "to appear before you"

494
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,800
 "Since you have come out of the darkness"

495
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,100
 "do not poison the light"

496
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,580
 "You must let the light shine"

497
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,780
 "so that the people of darkness will know"

498
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,480
 "the light of Zion is a thing"

499
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,880
 In the third verse

500
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,580
 when the light is brought out

501
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,680
 what impact will it have?

502
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,380
 The Bible says

503
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,260
 "The kingdom of man will come to save you"

504
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,820
 "The Lord will come to save you"

505
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,160
 What we see is

506
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,200
 the most important goal

507
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,900
 is to let the people of darkness

508
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,440
 know the beauty of light

509
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,700
 We know that Zion

510
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,580
 is a mission

511
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,880
 Likewise

512
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,080
 we see in the third verse

513
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
 "Your light and your revelation"

514
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,480
 the word "to rise up" appears again

515
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,580
 I want to say something

516
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,480
 in response to Zion's glory

517
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,980
 and its light

518
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,760
 to attract the people of darkness

519
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,100
 to Zion

520
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,860
 Zion has a mission

521
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,400
 to do this

522
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,620
 This is also a key point

523
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,220
 for Zion to witness God

524
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,460
 Zion has to bring out its light

525
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,000
 The light is not about how bright it is

526
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
 or how beautiful the city is

527
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,100
 The light is for the people of darkness

528
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,520
 to let the people of darkness know the light

529
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,920
 and let them know

530
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,280
 the origin of the light

531
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,180
 and what kind of God Jehovah is

532
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,820
 and to share his glory

533
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,120
 Zion is like a lighthouse

534
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,860
 It is the focus of the nation

535
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,120
 to let the nation know

536
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,100
 what the light is

537
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,760
 and to come to worship God

538
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
 and to offer up

539
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,860
 This is also what the book of Exodus says

540
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,400
 in chapter 60, verse 3

541
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
 It says a lot

542
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
 The people of darkness must return

543
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,540
 and offer up

544
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
 The people must be reconciled

545
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,040
 and see the hope

546
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,200
 This is what we sing in Exodus 60

547
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,680
 The lyrics

548
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,280
 are about this scene

549
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,440
 It is very special

550
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,120
 Exodus does not describe it clearly

551
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,920
 what kind of light Zion was under

552
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,880
 It only says

553
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
 regardless of the light

554
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,260
 Zion must shine

555
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,420
 and let people see hope

556
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,800
 Brothers and sisters

557
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,360
 For us

558
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,600
 for those who are new to the world

559
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,160
 and even for those who are here and now

560
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,500
 this is our mission

561
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,440
 Just like Jesus gave us the great mission

562
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,080
 to shine the light on our door

563
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,240
 I mean, the door of the Lord

564
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,480
 Brothers and sisters

565
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,420
 The focus of the light

566
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,380
 never says

567
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,020
 what kind of light we need to have in our life

568
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,140
 We never need to fulfill

569
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,720
 any criteria to shine the light

570
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,980
 We shine the light

571
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,420
 because we are willing to show

572
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,120
 the beauty of the light in our life

573
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,960
 Just like what Gaga said

574
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,860
 What God is good?

575
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,360
 I forgot what she said

576
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,160
 To let people see

577
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,700
 how great God is

578
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,200
 The Lord said to restore Zion

579
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,300
 and to shine the light for the Lord

580
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,640
 The light is not just about the light

581
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,140
 but to let more people around us

582
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,480
 worship and know the Lord

583
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,920
 I think this mission is very consistent

584
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,820
 When we look at the New Testament

585
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,020
 the disciples in the process of the church

586
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,820
 also shined the light

587
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,300
 to let more foreigners

588
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,060
 and more Jews

589
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,660
 become Christians and worship the Lord

590
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,440
 Let me say more

591
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,340
 Ah

592
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,540
 Back to Hong Kong

593
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,040
 I don't know if you've seen

594
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,540
 the history of Hong Kong

595
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,580
 In the past, Hong Kong was a center for the mission of the Church

596
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,740
 There were many different pastors

597
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,580
 such as Mary Sun

598
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,780
 They brought the light to Hong Kong

599
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,700
 and let many different churches

600
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
 come closer to the top

601
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,020
 During the summer vacation this year

602
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,800
 you went to Tuen Xuan

603
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,100
 In the process, we met Elman

604
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,960
 Sarah Wilson

605
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,240
 and Jackie

606
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,740
 I think that whether in Campbell

607
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,480
 Taiwan or Hong Kong

608
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,540
 they are using their lives to shine the light

609
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,180
 to let people see what it is to be a pastor

610
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:48,080
 I think that these are all true

611
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,280
 I think that these are all true

612
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,360
 For us, we see that

613
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,920
 God uses people from different places

614
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,060
 to let people see the beauty of the light

615
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,560
 Sisters

616
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,760
 In the past, we talked a lot about

617
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,900
 the growth of our lives

618
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,840
 We will continue to do so

619
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,180
 But this year

620
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,000
 I want to take another step forward

621
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,980
 to show everyone

622
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,480
 that faith has a universal nature

623
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,980
 Faith is not just about

624
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
 the relationship between ourselves and God

625
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,780
 Faith is not just about

626
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,920
 the relationship between ourselves and the group

627
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,660
 Faith is not just about

628
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,160
 the relationship between ourselves and the group

629
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,660
 Faith is not just about

630
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,260
 the relationship between ourselves and the group

631
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,700
 I think that in Hong Kong

632
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,640
 and in other places around the world

633
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
 there are many people

634
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
 who are doing the same thing

635
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,980
 Sisters

636
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,600
 Are we willing to

637
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,420
 step out of our comfort zone

638
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,520
 to do the "Let's go and shine" thing

639
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,620
 to let us show off

640
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,380
 in different places

641
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,320
 how bright we are

642
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,960
 and to let people see

643
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,360
 how beautiful the light

644
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,320
 and God in our lives are

645
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,300
 Sisters

646
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,700
 This year's theme is

647
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,200
 "Alive in Christ, Let's go and shine"

648
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,740
 I think that we, as colleagues

649
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,340
 would like to learn this thing together

650
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,500
 I'm not saying that

651
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,080
 when we can do "Alive in Christ"

652
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,740
 our lives will not be challenged

653
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,680
 and our lives will not be exhausted

654
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,420
 We will experience those things

655
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,980
 I'm not saying that

656
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,180
 as a missionary

657
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,180
 I can be alive 365 days a year

658
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,820
 There will be times when I feel exhausted

659
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,660
 But I think that

660
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,420
 when we are in a momentary situation

661
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,960
 our life

662
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
 is there a choice

663
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,660
 to continue to seek God?

664
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,260
 Just like what Gaga said

665
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,140
 "The wisdom of the soul"

666
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,740
 Is there a wisdom

667
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,540
 in our lives

668
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,800
 that we can continue to walk like this?

669
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,000
 Sisters, I think that

670
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,300
 this is something that we, as colleagues

671
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,180
 would like to continue to learn together

672
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,440
 "Alive in Christ, Let's go and shine"

673
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,340
 is the call of Isaiah

674
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,580
 When Zion was saved by God

675
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,380
 he had a mission

676
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,460
 to let the light out

677
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,620
 so that the people in darkness

678
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,820
 could see the light and respond to the light

679
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,060
 The Apostles of the Lord

680
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,560
 and the Apostles of the Lord

681
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,160
 are actually moving stones

682
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,440
 to show the light in their lives

683
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,340
 and to let people see it

684
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,040
 Sisters, today

685
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,340
 this plate may have been passed down to us

686
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,900
 Don't think that when you are young

687
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,440
 you think, "No, I still have to take the DSC"

688
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,580
 "Don't, don't care about me"

689
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,240
 "Please forgive him, don't forgive me"

690
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,580
 But sisters

691
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,120
 the mission is the core of our faith

692
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,260
 Let us learn to respond together

693
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,420
 First, learn the first thing

694
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,460
 "Alive in Christ"

695
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,000
 When we experience the transformation of the life of the cross

696
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,200
 don't go to the walking dead in November

697
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
 What we see is that

698
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
 the light of our life comes from the Lord

699
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,200
 The Lord continues to shine in our lives

700
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,280
 to walk out of the words we have written in the cross

701
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,380
 We have to learn to continue

702
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,120
 like what we said last week

703
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,480
 we have to do a walking bible

704
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,880
 Similarly, when our lives are kept alive

705
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,620
 we should not only be a witness to the light

706
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,420
 but also learn to "Let's go and shine"

707
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,460
 This is a mission that God gave us more than 2,000 years ago

708
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,060
 to let the light shine

709
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,500
 to let people see the beauty of the light

710
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,800
 Indeed, we are also like this

711
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,980
 Some of the elders in the church

712
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,100
 when we go to different places

713
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,980
 we can let people around us see the beauty of the light

714
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,080
 But, sisters, are we willing to see

715
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,580
 that this is what God has given us

716
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,220
 Are we willing to let this become

717
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,860
 what we have been dreaming of and what we have been doing?

718
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,460
 Sisters, I would like to invite you to stand up

719
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,760
 Let's sing a song of repentance

720
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:14,180
 Sisters, I don't know

721
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,580
 when you go home today

722
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,080
 and see the words you have written in the cross

723
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,960
 I don't know if you have ever thought about it

724
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,260
 What you should think about is

725
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,160
 how you want to implement it in your life

726
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,460
 If you haven't thought about it

727
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,500
 you might be writing the same thing

728
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,700
 when you make a better cross next year

729
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,340
 But let us continue to learn

730
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,140
 to keep our lives alive in Christ

731
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,140
 so that we can take another step

732
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,080
 Let's go and try

733
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
 Let's sing a song of repentance

734
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,720
 There is still darkness covering the earth

735
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,720
 There is still darkness covering the people

736
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,740
 There is still a way to wait for you

737
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,740
 There is still darkness covering the earth

738
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,740
 There is still darkness covering the people

739
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,680
 There is still a way to wait for you

740
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,480
 There is still a way to wait for you

741
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,260
 There is still darkness covering the earth

742
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,460
 Let us announce together

743
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,460
 Your repentance is enough

744
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,200
 Your repentance is enough

745
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,200
 Your repentance is enough

746
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,480
 Your repentance is enough

747
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,220
 Your repentance is enough

748
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:02,220
 Your repentance is enough

749
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:10,560
 You always appear to guide me

750
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:18,540
 The light of the sun never fades away

751
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:25,540
 Like my feet, they are full of your wisdom, forever

752
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:33,060
 May the world see the record of your love

753
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,660
 Your repentance is enough

754
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,360
 Your repentance is enough

755
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,360
 Your repentance is enough

756
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,000
 Your repentance is enough

757
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,580
 Your repentance is enough

758
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,580
 Your repentance is enough

759
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,680
 Your repentance is enough

760
