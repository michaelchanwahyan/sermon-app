[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]   Good morning, sisters.
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500]   I think we should give a round of applause to our teachers.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.500]   This is a very good demonstration.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000]   Is this demonstration the same?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   I think the most touching thing is the new teaching method.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.700]   The teachers have always been…
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.500]   I have seen it myself,
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.900]   especially last week, I went to Dongguan.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.000]   A few churches there invited me to speak
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.300]   about the development, management and education of the church.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.000]   What I told them was that without success, there would be no success.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.400]   But they wanted to know if we could introduce the method to them step by step.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.800]   They even invited our private class.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.000]   This was a few months ago.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500]   Is it possible to communicate with them?
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.600]   They saw that the worship of the Church of God
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.300]   was continuously created by many new songs, new verses and new verses.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.300]   Secondly, they really appreciated the new songs and new verses
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.000]   brought by the Church of God.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.800]   They were able to prepare the hearts of the people.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   But they didn't see some of the things.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.800]   But they knew that our brothers and sisters went there to help them
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.700]   to teach them how to wear the robe,
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.800]   to teach them how to wear the robe,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.200]   to teach them how to love their spouse.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   Not all of them went.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.800]   Only our brothers and sisters went.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.100]   Because of this, they were curious to ask,
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.500]   "How did you do it?"
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.200]   Listen, my brothers and sisters.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.300]   I think everyone knows how to recite the Great Message.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.200]   Do you know how to recite it?
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.600]   But whether you know how to interpret the question
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.300]   depends on each person.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.900]   I think everyone knows
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.000]   that the most important commandment of the Great Message
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.100]   is only one commandment.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300]   That is, "Let the people go as they come."
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.500]   How do we do that?
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.000]   There are three different ways.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.800]   "Go" means not to wait for people to come.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.600]   "Going" means to go.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.200]   You have to go to every different place.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.500]   You have to go to the place where people are staying.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.200]   You have to find the people
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.500]   and bring the Great Message to them.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.300]   But don't give it to them so easily.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300]   Once you believe, you have to help them wash the dishes.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.500]   You have to warm up their foundation.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.700]   If the foundation is not warmed up,
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.200]   they will become a woman.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.800]   The same is true for Christians.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.500]   Why do I believe?
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.000]   Unless they have become disciples,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.300]   we will baptize them.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.700]   We will baptize them.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   They will be integrated into the life of the Church
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.000]   and become a part of the body.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.600]   But in the body,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.700]   every body has a function.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   Do you agree, Brother Deng?
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.800]   If there is anything useless in your body,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.000]   you can cut it off.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.400]   No.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   There is nothing useless.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000]   "Doctor, I think the ears are ugly.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.300]   Can you cut them off?"
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.800]   "The nose is ugly. It's so high.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.200]   Can you cut it off?"
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.800]   "My hands are better than my legs.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.200]   My legs are useless.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.900]   Can you cut them off?"
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.100]   "What are the nails for?"
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.200]   "Why don't you make them all out and make them look better?"
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.800]   I tell you,
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.300]   it is impossible to cut them off.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.600]   Everything has its function.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.900]   In today's Church,
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.500]   we hope that everyone in the Church
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.300]   can see that everyone who comes to the Church
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.700]   has a function.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.200]   Nothing is useless.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.000]   Everything is very important.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.300]   I have told people many times
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.000]   what attracts a newcomer to the Church
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.700]   and keeps coming.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.200]   The first impression.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.300]   When they come,
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   they look at our Sister Deng.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.700]   Are they very enthusiastic?
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.600]   When they come,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.100]   they are very active in meeting and greeting them.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.200]   They never say,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.400]   "Where is your toilet?"
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   Then they respond,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.900]   "Go and find it."
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.900]   I tell you,
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.400]   if you have this attitude,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   they will not come again.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.800]   Unless you say,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400]   "I will take you there."
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.100]   You take them there and bring them back.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.200]   I tell you,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.700]   this impression
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.200]   makes them very impressed.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.000]   They will feel that
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.700]   they will definitely come back.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.100]   It is not that they decide after hearing the pastor's words.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.300]   It is from the first day of the meeting.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.800]   If you are a person of grace,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.400]   a body,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.600]   you should do your best
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.800]   to greet them,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.200]   to treat them,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.400]   to care for them,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.700]   to love them.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.100]   Any brother or sister,
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.800]   when they have this need,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.700]   we will immediately,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.300]   for their needs,
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.900]   find a suitable person
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.300]   at the right time
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.800]   to do the right thing
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.900]   to help them.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.100]   This is what we should do.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   In the past two weeks,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.000]   the number of people who have asked for help has been increasing.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.400]   A year ago,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.500]   the director of the Chinese Academy of Medicine,
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500]   Dr. Liang Jialun,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.800]   had already contacted me.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.600]   He said that he had opened a new Chinese Academy in Rome.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.100]   In this new Chinese Academy,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.600]   he wanted to teach the Bible.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.000]   Many people could help him.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.600]   Many people could help him teach the Bible.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.400]   But when it comes to the development of the Church,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.200]   the establishment of the Church,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.000]   he thought about it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.800]   No one could help him.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.000]   So two years ago,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.900]   he told me,
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.200]   "Dr. Song,
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.400]   can you come?"
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.200]   I asked, "How can I come?"
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.900]   "You come for half a year."
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.100]   This is what their teaching is like.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.900]   They come for half a year.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.200]   After half a year,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.100]   Italy does not allow them to stay for more than half a year.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.300]   They have to leave.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.200]   After they leave,
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   they go back again half a year later.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.000]   After they leave, they go back again for half a year.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.500]   I told him,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   "Dr. Liang,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.500]   I have two Chinese Academy.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.900]   I can't leave."
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.200]   The first one is the Chinese Academy of Medicine,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.500]   the second one is the Chinese Academy of Medicine,
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.500]   I kept mentioning it.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.600]   If you want me to go there for a month in a row,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.200]   I can't do it.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.300]   Because in fact,
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.500]   I need to teach
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.400]   everything I do.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.200]   I need to teach.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.100]   After he heard it,
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.800]   he told me last year,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.300]   "Dr. Song, I know you can't stay for so long,
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.200]   but can you open your mind?"
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   How to open your mind?
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.700]   "You come for 10 days."
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.300]   "10 days intensive."
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.600]   It means a dense course.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.500]   "Come and help our students."
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.900]   Because of this reason,
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.900]   two weeks ago,
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.400]   I promised him to go to Rome.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.000]   When I went to Rome,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I didn't just teach in his Chinese Academy.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.800]   He also arranged a nearby
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.300]   Roman Chinese Academy.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.800]   But there is a church in Petrova.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.400]   Petrova is
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.200]   a train station that is 3.5 to 4 hours away from Rome.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.400]   He said that church is worth helping.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.200]   So I went to Petrova.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.300]   When I went to Petrova,
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.500]   I found that this church
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.600]   has 300 to 400 people.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.800]   But what I really admire about them
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.100]   is that 85% of the people
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.900]   are under 40 years old.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.200]   I tell you,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   today, you can't find a church
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.300]   in the whole world
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.600]   that is so young and energetic.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.400]   Second,
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   this church serves
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.000]   a businessman,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.500]   an elder,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.600]   no priest,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.300]   all are believers.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.500]   And their believers
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.300]   are not only working,
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.300]   but also serving in the church.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.000]   But the only problem is
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.900]   that there is no one who is always serving them,
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.400]   training people to serve.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.300]   Many of them can't make it.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.100]   They are worried that the church will be lost.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.500]   So when I went there,
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.600]   a sister told me that
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.100]   recently there is a new heaven and earth church.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.400]   Some people invited them to go there.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.600]   She asked, "What is a new heaven and earth church?"
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.100]   She saw that they are good people
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.300]   and helped this and helped that.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.400]   So she brought some people there.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.600]   When I heard that,
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.300]   I was very worried.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.600]   I told her,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.800]   "Do you know what a new heaven and earth church is?"
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.400]   "I want to ask you."
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.800]   "Do you know what a new heaven and earth church is?"
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.000]   "If you know, raise your hand."
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.300]   I think we are all just daydreaming.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.700]   The new heaven and earth church
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.400]   is the most dangerous
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.800]   and even the most evil church in South Korea.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.300]   They said that the new heaven and earth church has already come
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.700]   and is in our church.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.500]   So you join our church
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.200]   and enjoy the new heaven and earth church.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.100]   When I heard that,
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.100]   I was very worried.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.500]   They are so serious
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.300]   and so vague.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.000]   But the pastor and the pastor's wife
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.400]   don't know what it is.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.300]   Secondly,
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.800]   they had two or three churches
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.200]   that were very close.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.100]   They went to church and together.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.200]   They all gathered together.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.500]   They all gathered together
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.100]   so that they could go to church very soon.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.500]   But since last year,
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   there was a church
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   and the pastor told them,
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.300]   "We will not cooperate with you."
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   "You come to our church
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.000]   and we come to your church."
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.300]   "Because recently,
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.000]   there was a member of our church,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.900]   I don't know his name,
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.700]   he is very capable
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.400]   and he is very capable in healing."
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.900]   "After hearing all these,
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:17.600]   he looks like a new believer."
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.100]   So I asked them,
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.000]   "Do they know how to speak in dialect?"
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.200]   They said, "Pastor, how do you know?"
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.900]   I told them,
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.700]   "The most dangerous movement now
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.900]   is the New Testament Movement."
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.700]   When I spoke,
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.100]   when they heard me,
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.000]   they added one more lesson.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.500]   I had already said and done everything.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.300]   The night before I left,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.700]   I had to give them two hours
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.700]   to talk to us.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.300]   We need training.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.500]   How do you train us?
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.300]   I told my younger sister,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.000]   "After I went to Rome,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.500]   after I went to Dongguan,
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.200]   I found that all the problems
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.300]   are related to the understanding of the Word of God
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.100]   and how to describe the Word of God.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.200]   How do we find a suitable factory
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.100]   to train them?"
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.600]   When I was in the church,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.300]   I met a group of preachers
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.000]   who were preachers in France.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.200]   They had a one-year trial period,
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.000]   but it was not enough.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.800]   The church told them,
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.200]   "We don't want to continue."
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.000]   The group of preachers
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.300]   came back to Hong Kong or Malaysia.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.600]   They were in Malaysia,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.400]   but they had been in Hong Kong for six years.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.000]   They went to this church to learn.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.700]   I happened to be there to teach.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.500]   Both of them came.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.600]   After they came,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.800]   they told me
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.100]   that the church in their hearts was unhappy
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.100]   and that their約 was not yet full.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.300]   They did not want to continue.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.100]   I asked them why.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.000]   They told me that the church was in France.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   In the French church,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.300]   in the meeting,
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.400]   one-third of the people
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.700]   were French.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.300]   They spoke French.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.400]   The meeting was to teach French to the sisters.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.500]   They all spoke French.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.000]   But none of the preachers
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.400]   knew a single French word.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.300]   I asked, "If you don't know French,
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.100]   does that mean you don't have a license?"
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.700]   They said, "Yes, we don't."
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.000]   I asked, "How do you open a meeting?"
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   They said, "Someone will translate for you."
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.700]   "You go to visit people,
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.800]   but you don't know how to drive a car.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.300]   How do you go?"
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.200]   They said, "Someone will drive you."
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.300]   I realized that if that was the case,
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.700]   you would be blind,
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.300]   and you wouldn't be able to see French.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.900]   You would be deaf, and you wouldn't be able to hear French.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.500]   You would be mute, and you wouldn't be able to speak French.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   You would be deaf.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.600]   I told them,
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.700]   "Brother,
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.200]   I don't think you should blame the church,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   but you should blame your missionary organization.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.700]   When our missionaries join the OMF,
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.900]   they need to learn the language for at least two years.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.500]   After learning, they need to pass the test,
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.600]   and then they can go to the factory.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.500]   How can you do that so quickly?"
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.800]   I told them,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.500]   "I encourage you to think about
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.500]   using your own language
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.800]   to serve in the places you go to.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.200]   Don't waste your time.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.400]   It's not worth it."
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.900]   Dear brothers and sisters,
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.900]   today I am here to talk about
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:01.000]   the importance of "the living and the dying."
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.700]   Let's take a look at this PowerPoint.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.400]   1 Timothy 2, 1-6.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.000]   I would like to show you
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.700]   how the Bible uses this great mission
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.800]   in their actual lives.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.900]   Let's read together.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.900]   "I tell you,
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.700]   you must be strong in the one side of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.500]   You must hear my teaching in front of many witnesses.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.700]   You must be faithful and faithful
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.000]   to be able to teach others."
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.900]   This is the Bible.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.000]   You can see
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.500]   that the most important thing is the living and the dying.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.700]   Paul explains it very clearly.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.300]   He tells Timothy,
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:47.100]   "Timothy, you must be strong in the one side of Jesus Christ."
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.700]   If you pay attention,
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.400]   both the later and earlier books of Timothy
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.700]   are very personal books
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.100]   especially given to Paul and Suleiman.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.200]   One of the sons is Timothy,
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   and the other is Tithon.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.700]   But these two books are different.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.100]   The content of the books
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.100]   is very different from that of Tithon and Timothy.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.800]   The tone of the words is also different.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.700]   Why?
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.000]   Because it is very simple.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.100]   Paul knew these two sons.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.800]   He even knew their personalities.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.000]   Timothy was a good boy.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.500]   Timothy was a relatively weak person.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.100]   He was introverted.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.700]   He grew up in a Christian family.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.300]   But the problem was that he had not gone through the storm.
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.400]   Because of this reason,
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   what did he need most?
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.300]   He saw him.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.200]   What you need most is actual experience.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:51.300]   The appearance you get from your mother's faith
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.600]   is completely correct.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.900]   But is it enough?
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.500]   Paul tells him, "You are not strong."
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.100]   Because of this,
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.000]   when he saw this family living for a very short time,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.900]   he felt their bottom.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.900]   What is the bottom?
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.300]   It is not just social relations.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.500]   "Have you eaten?"
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.400]   "Good morning."
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.300]   "How are you?"
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:11.900]   "I am fine."
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.400]   No.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.900]   It is not even a deep relationship.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.900]   A deep relationship means
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.300]   that you know the deep things in your heart.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.400]   You know how their original family is.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.500]   Paul had to enter the spiritual realm.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.400]   In our group today,
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.100]   I want to tell you
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.300]   not to pretend
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.500]   that no one knows your original family.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.900]   Your struggle,
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.800]   your struggle in the spiritual realm,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.500]   we have to enter the spiritual realm.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.800]   We have to use the words of God,
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.100]   our experience,
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.700]   the experience of some brothers and sisters,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.000]   and the experience of the ancestors.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.900]   We have to encourage each other.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.100]   This is what we have to do today.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.300]   So we can see clearly here
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.100]   that Paul is applying the Great Mission.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.200]   Go.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.900]   Go to this home.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.200]   Then put the needs of this home
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.600]   in your heart.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.800]   Then, based on the needs he knows,
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.900]   based on the different people,
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.400]   give different instructions.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.600]   This is why
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   after following Paul,
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.900]   there was a great experience.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.100]   In the church of Philippians,
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.200]   after he drove away the demons,
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   he was persecuted and imprisoned.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   Throughout the whole process,
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   from beginning to end, he was persecuted.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.300]   How did Paul meet the Lord in prison?
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.200]   The Lord knew.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.700]   Today, I will first show you
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.900]   Paul's attitude towards the Lord
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.400]   in the "The Message of the New Life"
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.700]   He said to the Lord,
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.800]   "Lord,
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.900]   I am your son.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.400]   You must know
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   that you have to listen to what I teach
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.900]   in front of many witnesses.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.000]   You must also teach those who are faithful and can teach others."
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.800]   There are four generations of hermits here.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.200]   Paul was the first generation.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.800]   Timothy was the second generation.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.300]   Those who are faithful and can teach others
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.200]   were the third generation.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.400]   Then there were others, the fourth generation.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.200]   They must be in the fire of the Lord.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.800]   I am very grateful to see our disciples today.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.400]   They have the fire of the Lord.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.000]   How did the masters come?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Through training.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.800]   The Bible says
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.700]   that our patriarchs did the same thing.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.400]   Every year,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.800]   a shepherd would come with me.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.300]   Or a pair of shepherds would come with me.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.100]   After the shepherd,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.800]   the next would be the patriarch.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.500]   After the patriarch,
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.600]   the new life,
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   the "re-education of values" would come.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.000]   These people came out
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.800]   and became members of the group.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   Can we divide into two groups?
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   Can we divide into four groups?
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.400]   We kept dividing
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.000]   until we had soldiers to use.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.400]   Dear brothers and sisters,
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   the patriarchs were like this.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.800]   Three groups.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   What happened?
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.400]   We had three groups of leaders.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.600]   We had a deputy leader.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.000]   Then we had a team.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.400]   One more thing,
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   the disciples.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.100]   In the past,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.000]   we had this arrangement.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Every person in the three groups
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   had two or three disciples
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.600]   to preach for them.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.800]   After preaching, you would be the leader.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.000]   What was the purpose of the disciples?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.600]   The purpose was to become members of the three groups.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   After being members,
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.400]   they would be on the team.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.000]   Then they would be deputy leaders.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.600]   Then they would be leaders.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   The new life.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.000]   You may ask,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.200]   "Why is that?"
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   Because it's very simple.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.600]   The disciples had experienced it.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.400]   In the past, we didn't have this arrangement.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   What was the result?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.000]   Let's look at the 18th chapter of the Book of Genesis.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.200]   This chapter left a deep impression on me.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   It was around 32 years ago.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   32 years ago, in 1992 or 1991,
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   we decided to form a small group to lead the church.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   The main reason was
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.800]   that we had 100 disciples at the beginning.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   In the second year, we had more than 200 disciples.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.400]   In the third year, we had 300 or 400 disciples.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   But at that time,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.600]   there were only two preachers.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.400]   How could we raise so many people?
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.800]   Moreover,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.000]   the people of the Holy See were very good at choosing.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.600]   They would find a deputy leader.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.200]   They would find someone from the Hong Kong TV station,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.800]   meaning the Hong Kong TV station,
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.600]   who was the most helpful to us.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.000]   They would find him.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.800]   So I invited two preachers to find me.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.600]   I invited four preachers.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.400]   They found me again.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   The result was
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.200]   exactly the same as Moses' experience.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.000]   His father told him,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.400]   "Moses, you can't do it like this.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.200]   One by one, they are lining up to find you,
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.400]   to break up the discipline.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.200]   What is the result?
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.600]   How many disciples do you have?
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.400]   Two million.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.200]   You have to find thousands of people.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.600]   You have to line up.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.800]   Why do you have to line up?
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.600]   Because it's not your turn yet.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   Moses was the only one to be a deputy leader,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.200]   to arrange and break up the discipline.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.600]   So he was lining up from morning to night.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.400]   Moses had to be a deputy leader from morning to night,
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.000]   to do all kinds of different things.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.600]   His father told him,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.400]   "The result of your doing this,
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.200]   first, you will burn out.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.000]   Second, the people will rush out.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   Third, sooner or later, everyone will die out."
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   After I saw Moses,
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   I had a very deep impression.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   It was because of this that I reminded myself,
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.600]   "So, Moses,
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.000]   do you want to be the only one acting,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.400]   and the rest of the people watching,
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.600]   and the result of your doing this,
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.400]   you will burn out,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.600]   and the rest of the people will rush out?
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.200]   In the end,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.600]   all the people in the assembly,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   including you,
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.400]   will all die out?"
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.600]   I was in agony.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.000]   I decided to do one thing.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.600]   I decided to group up the whole church.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.400]   I formed a small group to share the burden.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.000]   I gathered my strength.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.400]   The church members gathered their strength
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.000]   to form a group.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.400]   Once the group was formed,
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.000]   the group leader would lead the group.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   The group leader would lead the group.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   First,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   the first group to benefit from this
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   was the church members themselves.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Some say, "Learning is not enough."
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.400]   But what we actually see is,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.600]   "Teaching is not enough."
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.200]   When we go to preach,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.600]   when we form a group,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.800]   we see where we are lacking.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.000]   You go to read,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.200]   you go to write,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   you go to listen,
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.800]   and even when you are pre-studying,
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.600]   when the church leaders are doing the pre-study,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.000]   you will be distracted.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.800]   You won't be sleeping.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   You will be writing everything down.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.000]   The reason is that you need to form a group.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.600]   Dear brothers and sisters,
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.200]   have you seen your responsibilities?
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.600]   Your children,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.800]   your families,
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.000]   your grandchildren.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Recently, I received a message from a brother,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Wallace, who is a member of the "Patriarchal Family."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.400]   And his wife.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.200]   When they returned to the US,
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   their eldest grandson came to check.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.600]   He was diagnosed with a blood clot.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.200]   Then, their eldest grandson, eldest son, and eldest granddaughter
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.400]   came to check their values.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.800]   Then, they went to several different churches
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.600]   to help them form a group.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.400]   I felt "Hallelujah" in my heart.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.200]   I was filled with gratitude for this brother.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   Also, he helped us to watch over the owner of the building.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.400]   I don't know if you have seen that video.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.200]   He said, "I am your descendant."
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.000]   Why?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.400]   "I am the disciple of Bass."
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.600]   Bass, the elder, can you stand up?
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.800]   Let's give Bass a round of applause.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:44.400]   Bass, please stand up.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.200]   When Bass was working for the government,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.400]   this owner, Kwong Ching Wai,
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.000]   was his subordinate.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   He was an official.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   He went to check on Wai Cheng's estate.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.600]   When he arrived, he was very concerned about him.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.200]   Why did he have so many worries?
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.000]   He started to drink with his whole family.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.200]   In order to make Wai Cheng believe him,
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.800]   he said, "I believe you."
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.200]   It was just a cover-up.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.800]   But he did not let go of this cover-up.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.400]   He said, "You have been here once.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.600]   You said you believed me.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.000]   Why don't you go to his church with my master?"
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.200]   Where was the church?
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.000]   It was in the side of Fang Fang,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.200]   in the Yin Fu Tang.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.800]   He came for the first time.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.000]   When he came for the first time,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.600]   he just said, "The 10th and 6th precepts are that one cannot kill."
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   "That's great!"
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.200]   Wai Cheng said that.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   I don't want to say it again.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.800]   But I was very touched.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.200]   This brother, Kwong Ching Wai,
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.800]   after learning the "One Drop of Blood",
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.000]   he went back to the U.S. Embassy in Singapore.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.400]   He started to lead the group from that time.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.200]   He led the group in doing business,
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.400]   in doing everything.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.200]   He led the group in the elders.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.600]   Until now,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.000]   he has not changed.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.600]   He leads a few,
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.800]   a dozen "One Drop of Blood" groups every year.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.400]   I am very grateful.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.200]   This brother is a faithful person.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.800]   Now, let's see
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.600]   how we can spread the gospel.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.400]   First, we need to study.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   Study is,
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.800]   as long as Paul teaches,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   you need to teach those who are faithful and can teach others.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.400]   You need to find suitable people to teach them.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   Until everything I teach you,
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.000]   you tell them everything.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.200]   But is it enough?
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   No.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.600]   Finally, let's look at the 3rd precept.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.200]   It's not just about preaching.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.600]   From the 3rd precept to the 6th precept,
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   the subject is too exaggerated.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   Let's read it together.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   You must be like me.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   Next page, please.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.200]   Yes, I will read it together.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.400]   You must be like me,
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.800]   suffer together,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.000]   as a Christian soldier of Jesus.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.600]   Those who are in the army
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.800]   cannot be arrogant.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.600]   It is better to let the people in the army be happy.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.800]   When the athletes are competing,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.600]   they cannot be proud of their ability,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.200]   but they must be hard-working.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.400]   Let me tell you,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.600]   preaching is absolutely necessary.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.400]   In Timothy's family,
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.600]   his mother and his grandmother
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.200]   were very important to him.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:43.400]   He saw the faith in his mother and grandmother.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.000]   What is this faith?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.800]   It is not hypocritical at all.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.000]   What did he believe?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.400]   What did he do?
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.600]   What did he say?
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   What did he do?
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:59.000]   This is the example of his mother and grandmother.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   So the word "inconsistency"
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.400]   is not a hypocrisy.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.600]   It is not a big talk.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.800]   It is something that can be said and done.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.400]   Dear brothers and sisters,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.000]   you must know that
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.800]   your children,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.600]   your grandchildren,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.200]   they are always against
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.400]   the students who do not believe.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.200]   Secondly, they are against the teachers who do not believe.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   How can you influence them?
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   By church?
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.400]   They come to church for one, one hour, two hours a week.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.200]   Can you change their past?
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.800]   Absolutely not.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.600]   How can you influence them?
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.000]   It depends on how you treat them at home.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.600]   If they see that you are very different from others,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   from the aunties and uncles that they know,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.400]   I tell them,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.200]   "It is very difficult for you to make them not believe in our Lord."
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.400]   I have seen it. I have shared it with my friends.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.600]   I have been to my friends' homes.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.000]   "Wow, they are all rude when they eat."
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.400]   "Dad is rude."
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.000]   "Mom is rude too."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.600]   Then the children take their food and go to the TV.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.800]   They have nothing to talk about.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.400]   When they go to drink tea, they take a newspaper.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   They don't talk at all.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   But we are not like that.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.800]   We don't break our fingers.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.200]   They feel very different.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.000]   Then their classmates come to our home.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.200]   I tell them, "Your home is very strange."
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.000]   They ask, "How is it strange?"
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.200]   "Why do you all hold hands and pray?"
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   "When you eat, you give me food, I give you food."
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.400]   "Why are you so busy?"
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.800]   "That is love."
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.200]   But he said,
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.200]   "I like your home very much."
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.000]   He likes our home.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.800]   I am very grateful.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.000]   His classmates.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.400]   Many of them came to our church.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.000]   They are all men.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Why?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.600]   Because they saw
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.000]   something that his home did not have.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.800]   Something that he did not have.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.400]   Something that he did not care about.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.200]   Dear brothers and sisters,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.000]   don't think that when we are at home,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.800]   you are like this.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.200]   You don't say anything, you don't do anything.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.800]   Your son or daughter will become a believer.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   And become a disciple.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   That is impossible.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.400]   Unless we are in the Church of the New Testament and the Church of the Old Testament,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   we are allowed to see that we are living
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.800]   and that is what we believe.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.000]   We are living what we believe.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.200]   We are attracted to it.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.800]   Listen to my sermon.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.600]   Let's try to see.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   Paul was like this.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.400]   Thimolthi was like this.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.000]   Let's come and see.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.200]   In the New Testament, Paul told him,
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.000]   "You will suffer with me."
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.200]   Don't think that if you believe, you will be a believer.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.800]   No.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:19.600]   Then Thimolthi thought of how Paul was imprisoned.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   One by one, he cried and cried.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.000]   He was very unhappy.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.400]   But when Paul entered the prison,
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.600]   he preached, sang, and praised God.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   He was beaten up by more than 40 people.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.200]   They took off their clothes and came to beat him.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:39.400]   After the beating, they put the two legs of the wooden dog on the metal chain.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.800]   They tied them up.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.200]   But what did they do when they entered?
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   They sang, preached, and praised God.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   I want to ask you.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.600]   They took off their clothes, beat him,
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   and then they were put in the prison.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.400]   They were very heavy prisoners.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   They were locked up.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.000]   If you were in there, would you preach?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.400]   Most people would.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.000]   What did you preach?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.400]   "Lord, you have sinned against me."
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.200]   "People in your world have come to wrong me."
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.400]   "Punish them."
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.600]   Is this how you preach?
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.400]   "Let me get out of here quickly."
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.200]   Is this how you preach?
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.000]   No.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.600]   Second, you sang.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.800]   Can you sing?
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.600]   Third, you praised God.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.800]   Can you praise God?
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.400]   I believe that when you are in there,
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.200]   it is easier to pray to God.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.000]   It is very difficult to praise God.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.200]   But Paul, the prisoner of Syria,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.400]   was locked up like this.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.000]   What was the result?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.400]   The whole prison was full of prisoners.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.000]   It was shocking.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Why were these two prisoners locked up so easily?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.200]   So everyone was questioning what they were singing and preaching.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.600]   Then God performed a miracle.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.200]   The doors were broken.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.000]   The iron chains were broken.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.200]   But no one died.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.400]   Think about it.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.800]   How many earthquakes
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.600]   would shake your watch to the ground?
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   Can you think about it?
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.400]   How many earthquakes?
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.800]   Not even ten.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.600]   If you were broken,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.000]   your watch would shake.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.800]   I am sure it was not an earthquake.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   It was a miracle.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.200]   And at this miracle,
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.800]   the prison warden fell asleep.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.400]   It was a big problem.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.600]   When he woke up, he realized that he could not be saved.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.200]   He could not go back.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.600]   He wanted to die.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.800]   What did Paul do?
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.000]   Today, we will look at
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.400]   how deeply the faith that can be seen
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.800]   was affected.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.400]   First, the faith that can be seen.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.800]   Paul saw the body of the man.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.200]   He asked people to throw stones at him.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.600]   But he prayed,
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.000]   "Don't give them the sin."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.600]   Then he fell asleep.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.000]   Second, he saw the Lord's resurrection.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.200]   He showed it to him.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.600]   The 15th chapter of the Gospels,
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.000]   the 8th chapter begins.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.800]   He saw it with his own eyes.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.200]   Third,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.800]   the 14th chapter of the Book of Mormon.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.200]   He experienced it himself.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.800]   He was beaten with stones.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.600]   People thought he was dead.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.200]   He was dragged out of the city.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.000]   But he woke up.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.400]   When he woke up,
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.000]   he did not run away so quickly.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.400]   He entered the city again.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   Look at him.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.800]   He entered the city again.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   What did he do?
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.000]   He preached.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.200]   Then,
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.400]   the 16th chapter of the Book of Mormon.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.200]   This is the case of being wronged.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.600]   After the miracle happened,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.400]   the man wanted to commit suicide.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.000]   I think as a prison guard,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   when you saw him taking a knife to commit suicide,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.600]   you would not say a word.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.400]   You would watch him die.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.600]   Then you would leave.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.400]   Would you?
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.600]   You would watch him die.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.200]   You would watch him die.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.400]   After he died,
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.000]   you would leave.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.800]   But Paul did not.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.200]   He shouted,
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.600]   "Do not die!"
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.800]   "We are all here!"
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.200]   He said this
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   to the prison guard.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.000]   "I do not want you to die."
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.800]   "I would rather die."
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.000]   Because this prisoner
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.200]   could be executed at any time.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.000]   He was in a prison cell.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.600]   There was no chance to make a statement at that time.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.800]   He could do whatever he wanted.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   But Paul,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.000]   he was shouting for him.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.200]   The prison guard,
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.000]   at that time,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.200]   could not explain
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.400]   why there was such a prison guard.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.600]   "You could have watched me die."
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   "Why did you shout for me?"
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.000]   He was surprised.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.400]   So he asked,
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   "How can I be saved?"
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.800]   Paul told him,
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.000]   "When you believe in Jesus Christ,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.800]   you and your family will be saved."
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.200]   So, because of this reason,
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.000]   the prison guard believed in Jesus Christ,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.400]   so he took him out
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.400]   and brought him home.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.800]   He served them food,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.200]   washed their feet,
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.600]   and was also washed.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.000]   The whole family was washed.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.800]   "Are you sure you will die?"
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.200]   "The authorities are coming to find you."
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.400]   "Why are two heavy prisoners missing?"
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.800]   "One is called Paul, the other is called Sarah."
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.600]   "They went to the prison guard's house."
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.400]   "When the high priest saw this,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.000]   he let these two prisoners go to your house."
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   He believed in Jesus Christ.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.600]   He served them food,
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.000]   washed their feet,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   and did everything.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.200]   Some people believe
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.800]   that death is inevitable,
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:38.000]   and the whole family may be excommunicated.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.400]   But the Bible says in chapter 34,
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.000]   let's read it together.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.800]   "Then the prison guard took them to his house,
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.600]   and put them on a table,
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:56.400]   and he and his family were filled with joy."
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.800]   They were filled with joy.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.000]   From a person who was afraid of death,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.200]   who wanted to die,
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.400]   who wanted to commit suicide,
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.600]   and to change,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.000]   they became filled with joy.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.400]   Why?
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   Because they had seen the truth.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.800]   Jesus Christ is the Lord of Resurrection.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.200]   Why should I be afraid?
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.600]   Since what I did was right,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.000]   why should I be afraid?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.400]   The two prisoners were still there.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.600]   I can tell them what happened
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.800]   as a witness.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.200]   On the other hand,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.000]   how did Paul see his own departure?
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.800]   In the book of Timothy, chapter 4, verse 7-8,
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.000]   "He took a book and placed it on his son,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   and said to him, 'What is it?'
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.400]   'Let us read together.'
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.600]   'I have already fought the battle,
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.400]   and I have already gone all the way,
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   and I have already kept the way I believe.'
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.200]   'From now on, I will be known as a righteous man.'
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   'On the day the Lord of Justice comes,
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.600]   He will bestow upon me,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.000]   not only upon me,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.600]   but also upon all those who love Him.'"
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.000]   What does death mean?
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Death is the award of a class president.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.400]   To each of us who follows the Lord today,
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.600]   to the whole world,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.000]   death is the award of a class president
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.800]   after the sports race.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.200]   Who is the winner?
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.400]   Who is the winner?
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.200]   Paul said,
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.400]   "If I follow the Lord my whole life,
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.400]   I will be in front of God,
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.000]   in the Lord's hands,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.400]   and receive the champion's award."
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.000]   He will receive the title of the winner.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.200]   After visiting Rome,
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.400]   I saw many things
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   that can be seen in the faith.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.400]   I saw the influence of the faith
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.000]   Let me show you.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.600]   This time,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.400]   when I was not teaching,
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   I had a section every day,
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.200]   for two to three hours.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.800]   Someone took us to Rome.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   What did we visit?
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.600]   Some churches.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   They prepared for us
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.400]   some commemorative信徒.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.800]   The first one was
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   the place where Peter the Great was persecuted.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   I went to this place.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.200]   There were three floors of earthen houses.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.000]   The first floor.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   The second floor.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.600]   The third floor.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.800]   It was very dark.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.400]   The most unforgettable thing in my heart
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.800]   was this pillar.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.600]   It was written on this pillar
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.000]   that Paul was on this pillar.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.800]   I think he was made out of it.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.000]   It was a completely identical pillar.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   It was where he was beheaded.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   There was a painting
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   about Paul's faith.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   It also mentioned Peter's cross
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   was shown in that place.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   After that,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.600]   I saw that there was a document
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.400]   not only in Italian,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.800]   but also in English,
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.000]   which was written in that place.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.400]   This church commemorated
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.600]   Paul and Peter's faith.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.000]   I went to another church
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.600]   to commemorate a Roman Caesar
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:33.000]   named Cleopatra.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.600]   In the early 4th century,
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:45.000]   she killed 10,203 Roman soldiers.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.800]   Why did she kill so many soldiers?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.600]   Because these soldiers
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.800]   did not listen to Caesar
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.600]   when he was killing the Christians.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   They would rather I die
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.000]   than kill the Christians.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.600]   They were innocent.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.800]   That is why they were killed.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   I never thought that
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.200]   after the Great Emperor was killed,
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.800]   the next one to come was Constantine.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.400]   He changed the whole of Rome
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   to become a Christian country.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.600]   Why did he do that?
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   Why did he change?
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.200]   He saw some unchangeable facts.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   The number of Christians who died
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.400]   was 100,000.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:35.200]   What he believed was the true historical facts.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.800]   What they believed was the truth.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.200]   How did Paul go to jail?
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.600]   In Philippians 4, verse 22,
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.200]   he even said this
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   when he was in jail.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.400]   Let's read it together.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.200]   "The apostles and the saints asked you for your safety.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.000]   The people of Caesar
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.400]   asked you for your safety."
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.200]   He specifically said
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   that in this place of Philippi,
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   the people of Caesar
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.800]   asked you for your safety.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.400]   We will ask today,
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   why did the people of Caesar
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   ask the apostles for their safety?
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.800]   Unless someone in Caesar believed.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.200]   It turned out that Constantine's faith
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.400]   came from his mother.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   Where did his mother's faith come from?
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.000]   It must have been passed down to him by the Christians.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   How did the Christians pass it down?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.600]   It must have been passed down when he was in jail.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   I am here to offer this testimony.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   We can see
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.400]   that what Paul established
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.600]   was a model of living in the flesh.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.200]   The model of the Antiochian Church,
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   the education of the Holy Scripture,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.000]   was the most important.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.400]   It was in the Church,
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.800]   by the Church,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.600]   and for the Church.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.400]   It was established in the Church,
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.800]   by the Church,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   and for the Church.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.400]   In other words,
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.200]   the Holy Scripture education
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.600]   is closely related to the Church.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.800]   Let's watch a video
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.600]   and prepare our hearts.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.200]   Many of our brothers and sisters in the Church
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.000]   have received the equipment
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   and returned to the Church to serve.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.600]   We are grateful to them.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.200]   I hope we can
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.400]   study the Holy Scripture at any time, any place.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   "Live to learn, live to use, build a door to the world."
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.800]   "The whole world will be at your feet."
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.200]   "The whole world will be at your feet."
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.600]   I went to Rome
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.800]   to help the Italian Catholic Church
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.400]   that was established by Fr. Giancarlo Lungarum.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.000]   It was a Christian Catholic Church.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.400]   I came to help them.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.000]   On the other hand,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   we see that the whole world
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   is becoming more and more
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.800]   rich in equipment
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.400]   before the Lord comes.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.400]   I hope that the brothers and sisters in the Church
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.000]   can cherish this opportunity
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.800]   to seize the opportunity.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.400]   Our own Church has the Holy Scripture.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.200]   We can study more and more
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   and equip ourselves.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   May God bless you.
