173
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,760
 and do many things that are against God's will

174
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,240
 What St Paul was talking about was not people who did not believe in God

175
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
 He was talking about believers

176
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
 What does the Bible say?

177
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,400
 He says, 'there shall be no obstacles in your help'

178
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
 When it comes to believers

179
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 you should no longer be the same as those who did not believe in God

180
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,400
 You should have left the darkness and sins

181
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,200
 You should no longer do things that are the same as those who did not believe in God

182
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,040
 You should not do things that offend God

183
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,280
 But believers are still in the darkness

184
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,760
 Why are believers still in the darkness?

185
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,160
 Why are they separated from God?

186
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,080
 It is because they are ignorant and stubborn

187
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,120
 Not only that

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,920
 Let's look at the 19th chapter

189
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,400
 In the 19th chapter, the New Testament is even more straightforward

190
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
 The New Testament says,

191
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:46,160
 "Since they are ignorant, they should be free to do all kinds of things that are against God's will"

192
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
 What is he talking about?

193
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,000
 He is talking about people's choices

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
 People should be firm in their hearts

195
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,200
 People should be free to do all kinds of things that are against God's will

196
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,080
 In English, he says,

197
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,600
 "Greedy to practice every kind of impurity"

198
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,760
 It means that you want to practice

199
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,640
 What is he talking about?

200
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
 Not just once

201
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,920
 It is repeated over and over again

202
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 These practices may even become a habit

203
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,840
 It turns out that believers should have left the darkness

204
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,400
 They should have been in the light

205
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,680
 But they deliberately chose to break the law

206
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,360
 They went back to the darkness again and again

207
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,640
 And separated themselves from God

208
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,400
 When we look at this, we understand

209
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,400
 Why did Paul use such a strict, strict, and high-level sermon?

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
 Because it is people's will

211
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,600
 It is people's choice

212
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,840
 And this kind of life

213
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,040
 The life of leaving God

214
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,400
 The life in the darkness

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
 Is not able to build the body of Christ

216
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
 To raise Christ to glory

217
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
 But I think

218
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,600
 There is no reason for believers not to know

219
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,760
 Why do they fall back into the darkness so easily?

220
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
 Or maybe they are not willing to leave the darkness

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,920
 Let's understand what darkness means

222
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,920
 Darkness means that there is no light

223
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,960
 God did not make darkness

224
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,720
 God made light, but lost the light

225
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,920
 In ancient times, light was generally used

226
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,200
 To represent rational thinking

227
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
 In Judaism, light represents life

228
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,200
 It is mentioned in the Bible that light is Jesus himself

229
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,320
 It is God himself

230
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,240
 When people lose the light

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,560
 It means that they leave God

232
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,320
 Their hearts become dark

233
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,720
 They lose their rational thinking

234
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,200
 When they lose the light in the darkness

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,280
 Their souls become anxious, anxious, and fearful

236
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,840
 All kinds of worries come out

237
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 How do we settle these fears, worries, and pressures?

238
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,240
 People will do many things to help themselves settle their anxieties

239
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,120
 And what is the easiest thing to do?

240
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,160
 It is to do the things in the world

241
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,320
 It is the easiest thing to do

242
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,240
 When we can do these things in the world

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
 It is really OK

244
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,400
 We can have a moment of peace

245
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
 We can really settle some things

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,640
 Then we may want to do more

247
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,280
 We want to do more in the world

248
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,640
 When we do more in the world

249
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,520
 The distance between us and God will be further and further

250
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,920
 When the distance between us and God is further and further

251
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,160
 What will happen to our hearts?

252
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,520
 We will continue to be in the darkness

253
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,760
 When we are in the darkness, the anxiety will come out

254
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,560
 In the end, we will be in an infinite cycle

255
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,480
 We will keep practicing this mode

256
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,560
 So why did the Bible say that our hearts become numb?

257
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,080
 Because we have been used to practicing

258
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,840
 We don't know how to find God

259
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,320
 We are used to being in the darkness

260
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,120
 Especially when we are under a lot of pressure

261
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,640
 And when we are in trouble

262
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,880
 We will easily want to throw up

263
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,040
 The habit of throwing up

264
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,080
 Will easily appear in our lives

265
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,000
 I remember

266
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,640
 When I was still working at the workplace

267
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,520
 I remembered my colleagues

268
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
 My colleagues love to drink

269
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,280
 Of course, drinking is not a crime

270
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,760
 But I want to say that they don't drink

271
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,080
 They drink

272
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,920
 Do you know what drinking is?

273
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,720
 You know, right?

274
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,920
 You don't know? I see you are looking away

275
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,160
 That's great, you are so simple

276
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,120
 You drink until you are drunk

277
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,480
 They love to drink

278
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,840
 They drink when they are happy

279
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,360
 Because they are happy

280
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,880
 Drinking makes them happier

281
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,280
 What if they are not happy?

282
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800
 They drink even more

283
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,760
 Because they will be sober after getting drunk

284
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,280
 They will be drunk

285
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,680
 They will throw up and talk nonsense

286
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,560
 Some people will hug and kiss

287
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,560
 It's scary when a man kisses a woman

288
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,800
 Why do they drink when they are happy?

289
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,480
 Why do they drink when they are not happy?

290
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,360
 I believe

291
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,760
 They are under a lot of pressure at work

292
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,080
 They want to solve the pressure immediately

293
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
 They are not happy

294
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,640
 Drinking is a good way

295
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,800
 It brings a moment of happiness

296
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,680
 It brings a moment of happiness

297
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,280
 I believe they know

298
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,920
 It's not good for your body to get drunk with alcohol

299
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,000
 Some people drink until

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,680
 They look like they won't drink anymore

301
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,400
 They know it's not good, but they are used to it

302
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
 They can't change it

303
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
 They drink because they have to

304
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,320
 That's why they are happy

305
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
 They have to get drunk

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,880
 To forget their pain

307
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,000
 I think of young people

308
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,280
 They are under a lot of pressure

309
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
 At home, in their growth

310
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,640
 Or in their studies

311
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,240
 In their relationships

312
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,680
 They are under a lot of pressure

313
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,720
 They will use the way of cutting their hands

314
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,960
 To solve their inner pain

315
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,160
 They know it's not good to cut their hands

316
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
 It hurts, right?

317
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,520
 And if they cut their hands

318
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,800
 They will have to wear long sleeves in summer

319
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,720
 To cover it

320
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,880
 They don't dare to wear short sleeves

321
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,160
 But why do they still cut their hands?

322
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,280
 Because the pain in their heart is too painful

323
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,960
 They can't solve the pressure and pain

324
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,240
 They would rather their body's pain

325
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,360
 Can reduce their inner pain

326
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,320
 And it seems to work

327
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,520
 929 is a habit

328
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,960
 Continuous practice is a habit

329
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,840
 Yes, sisters

330
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,720
 I don't know

331
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
 Although we believe in God

332
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,960
 Our lives are saved by God

333
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,080
 But are there some things

334
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,640
 We can't get rid of the darkness?

335
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,720
 There are some things we should know

336
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,080
 Don't do it

337
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
 It's offensive to God

338
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
 It's not pleasant

339
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,880
 But are we using

340
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,440
 Some thoughts that don't fit God's mind

341
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,880
 Our way of life

342
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,800
 To deal with our insecurity?

343
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,560
 It even becomes our habit

344
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,240
 So we inadvertently

345
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,400
 Still stay in the darkness

346
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,880
 In the darkness

347
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,120
 And make us

348
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,120
 Get farther and farther away from God?

349
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,480
 Sister Ling

350
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
 I don't know what method you are using

351
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,720
 To deal with your pressure

352
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 What method

353
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,280
 To deal with your insecurity?

354
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,320
 These methods

355
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,720
 These life styles

356
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,000
 Have they made you

357
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,560
 Get farther away from God?

358
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,280
 Let's continue

359
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,720
 When we say

360
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,880
 There are still these old life styles

361
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,360
 Or these habits

362
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
 That make us fall into the darkness

363
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,240
 How can we return to the light?

364
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
 In the 20th chapter

365
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
 It says

366
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,960
 "But what you learned from Christ is not like this"

367
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,640
 "But"

368
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,320
 Usually

369
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,240
 The word "but"

370
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,120
 Is used to make a strong comparison

371
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,880
 I want to tell the believers

372
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,000
 Believers

373
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,640
 You shouldn't be like this

374
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,000
 You should be like Christ

375
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
 You shouldn't be like what I said

376
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,840
 Like the believers

377
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
 To be like Christ

378
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,640
 There is a verse that says

379
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,000
 I want to use the New Testament to make it clearer

380
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,960
 The New Testament says

381
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,200
 "You must have heard of his testimony"

382
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,120
 "And have received the teaching in him"

383
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,160
 "For the truth is in Jesus"

384
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,240
 The Bible uses the word "if"

385
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,920
 As if it is a conditional sentence

386
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,000
 A question sentence

387
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
 No

388
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,360
 This is a very solid statement

389
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,920
 What does it say?

390
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,520
 "For the truth is in Jesus"

391
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,520
 "And have received the teaching in him"

392
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,680
 And "receive"

393
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,640
 He uses the word "receive"

394
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,120
 Receive is not just about knowing

395
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,600
 Or knowing the truth

396
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,680
 It also includes the truth

397
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,000
 There is a very special verse

398
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,440
 He says

399
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,280
 "The truth is in Jesus"

400
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,960
 It's very interesting

401
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,160
 In the book of Paul

402
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,120
 The name "Jesus"

403
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,880
 Is not used often

404
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,480
 Because it is usually used to mean

405
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
 Jesus Christ

406
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
 Or Jesus Christ

407
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,960
 Or Jesus Christ

408
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,520
 The name "Jesus"

409
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,640
 Is very rare in the book of Paul

410
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,160
 I believe Paul wanted to tell the believers

411
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,760
 Jesus is a man who can live

412
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,320
 And speak the truth

413
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,640
 The believers should follow Jesus

414
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,040
 The believers should follow Jesus

415
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,040
 Not just to hear the truth

416
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,640
 But to listen to the teachings

417
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,600
 Or to understand

418
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,560
 And to carry out the teachings

419
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,000
 The truth

420
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,520
 Not just to hear

421
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,320
 But to carry it out

422
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,480
 Then

423
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
 In 22-24

424
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
 He tells us

425
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,240
 How to carry out the teachings of Jesus Christ

426
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
 In these three verses

427
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,520
 There are three uncertainties

428
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,880
 They are "discard"

429
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,480
 "renew"

430
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
 And "re-enact"

431
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,640
 Let's first look at

432
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,160
 "re-enact" and "discard"

433
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,720
 Because these two words are actually one word

434
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,600
 I found that the translation of "New Testament of Japan" is clearer

435
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,520
 No need to explain so much

436
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,720
 He says in "New Testament of Japan"

437
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,520
 "Discard" means to remove the old man

438
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,800
 This old man belongs to your past lifestyle

439
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,960
 "Discard" means to follow the old man

440
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
 "Discard" means to follow the old man

441
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 "The lust of the heart is growing day by day"

442
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,760
 We need to discard

443
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,320
 What is "discard"?

444
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
 It's about our old lifestyle

445
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,720
 Until we no longer follow

446
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,680
 The lifestyle of the non-believers

447
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,560
 Or the non-believers

448
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,720
 Of course

449
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,440
 Not all non-believers have problems

450
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,640
 They are all wrong

451
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,400
 What is he talking about?

452
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,000
 That lifestyle is to follow the lust of the heart

453
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,560
 Those who have problems

454
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,080
 Those who offend God

455
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,000
 The lifestyle of the non-believers

456
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,680
 We need to leave

457
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,760
 If you have the opportunity

458
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,920
 You can also look at the following 25-32 chapters

459
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,240
 There are more examples

460
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,280
 About what is not in line with God's will

461
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,480
 What is offending God

462
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,680
 Those things will lead the believers to leave God

463
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,160
 Farther and farther

464
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
 What do the believers need to do?

465
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
 They need to leave

466
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,880
 They need to stop this lifestyle

467
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,280
 Yes, they need to stop

468
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
 They can't have this lifestyle anymore

469
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,840
 This kind of habit

470
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,760
 Then we look at "discard"

471
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,920
 As I said, it's a pair

472
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,000
 It's like wearing clothes

473
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,720
 Except for a dirty shirt

474
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,800
 You need to wear a new shirt

475
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
 What is this shirt?

476
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
 It is to follow the image of God

477
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,680
 I don't know what you think of when you hear this

478
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,360
 You should think of God's creator

479
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,920
 Adam and Eve are made according to God's image

480
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,200
 Yes, we should be like Adam and Eve

481
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,120
 Made according to God's image

482
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,160
 We can be a new person

483
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
 Just like Adam and Eve in the beginning

484
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,880
 At the time of Eden

485
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,760
 They are no longer separated from God

486
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,160
 Very close to God

487
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,360
 We can live out the purpose of God's creation

488
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,360
 Our life can live out God's will

489
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,160
 But because of sin

490
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,240
 We are separated from God

491
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,800
 But Jesus Christ's redemption

492
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,840
 Let us return to God's embrace again

493
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,960
 Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life

494
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,640
 Lead us back to God's embrace

495
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 And the punishment that Jesus suffered

496
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
 And the punishment that Jesus suffered

497
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
 We should live out God's will

498
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,240
 So that we can return to God's embrace

499
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,160
 And become holy

500
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,480
 Yes, we should stop our old behavior

501
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
 Stop, don't do it again

502
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
 We should be a new person

503
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,560
 We should do the old things

504
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,680
 Don't do the dirty things

505
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,480
 But we should do the things that are in harmony with God's will

506
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,800
 And the last word is

507
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,040
 "Renew"

508
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,560
 In English, it means to be renewed in the spirit of your mind

509
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,280
 It's not just about renewing our mind

510
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,560
 It's our mind

511
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,240
 Are we willing to be changed by God?

512
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,360
 Are we willing to use a new way

513
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,480
 A renewed way

514
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,760
 To live out a new person, a new way of life?

515
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,960
 Why do we need to renew?

516
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,360
 Why do we need to use new things?

517
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,600
 Because the old things are not compatible

518
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,120
 It's like when you upgrade your phone and computer

519
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,320
 But you don't upgrade, you buy a new one

520
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,200
 You don't need to update the iOS, right?

521
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,480
 I don't know, I don't know

522
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,520
 Why do we need to change?

523
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,160
 To upgrade or to change a new phone or a new computer

524
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,480
 Because we need to adapt to the new era

525
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,520
 I have the courage to ask

526
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,240
 Is there anyone still using their phone

527
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,120
 To type and type in but not able to go online?

528
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,640
 Is there anyone still using this type of phone?

529
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,880
 Watchman, you seem to want to raise your hand

530
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,160
 We are basically normal

531
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,040
 Of course, there are some people who really need it

532
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,440
 Because they have two phones

533
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,840
 Maybe one of their phones is really just for typing

534
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,760
 But I believe most of us are using a smartphone

535
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,480
 Smartphone

536
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,440
 Yes, because of the need of the times

537
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,120
 If we are just using a phone for typing

538
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,800
 Our life is actually quite difficult

539
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,840
 Just going to a restaurant, you may not be able to eat

540
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,800
 Because the restaurant is ordering food

541
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
 You have to do the dishes yourself

542
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,120
 No one serves you

543
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,440
 Yes

544
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,480
 Because we need to adapt to a new life

545
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,520
 So we need to upgrade

546
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,880
 Yes, today, we believe in God

547
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,920
 We are new people, we need to upgrade and change

548
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,120
 Only by being able to adapt to a new life

549
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,480
 Can we be able to express God's will

550
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,880
 It's very interesting

551
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,160
 These three groups of words

552
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,400
 If we just look at "disappear" and "rebirth"

553
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,520
 We can understand what they mean

554
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,200
 But it's very interesting

555
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,880
 You will find that "disappear" is above

556
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,040
 "rebirth" is below

557
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,640
 "rebirth" is in the middle of "disappear"

558
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,440
 Yes, this is an important expression

559
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
 "rebirth" is very important

560
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,720
 Because our heart is affecting our brain

561
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
 Our brain is affecting how we walk

562
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,600
 This is how people should work

563
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,920
 Your heart is first

564
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
 Think about it

565
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,800
 If I want to buy a new computer

566
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,080
 My brain needs to think

567
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,640
 To decide the price

568
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
 Who is the cheapest

569
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,120
 Then I will buy it

570
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
 This is how it should work

571
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,560
 So, the word "rebirth" is in the middle

572
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,360
 It's very important

573
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,920
 If we don't want to

574
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,080
 It's very difficult to take action to coordinate

575
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,200
 Also, the word "rebirth"

576
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,760
 The original Chinese character is a present tense

577
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,480
 Yes, it's very interesting

578
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,080
 "Disappear" and "rebirth" are past tense

579
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,920
 The present tense has a continuous meaning

580
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,240
 It means to keep rebirthing

581
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,160
 It's not enough to rebirth once

582
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,240
 We need to keep rebirthing

583
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,440
 Why?

584
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,160
 Why do we need to keep rebirthing?

585
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,840
 I believe it's because

586
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
 Our old habits

587
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,160
 Our old lifestyle

588
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,440
 Have been with us for too long

589
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,880
 These habits are easy to get out of

590
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,320
 We need to be gifted

591
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
 To keep rebirthing our heart

592
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 To remind us again

593
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,600
 How to live out the Christian lifestyle

594
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,720
 Just like when we go to a restaurant

595
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,560
 We need to count the K-codes before we order

596
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,080
 At first, we are not used to it

597
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,720
 We want to ask the waiters to order

598
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,320
 But we need to count the codes

599
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,560
 When we are asked to do so

600
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
 But as we count the codes

601
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,200
 Maybe today

602
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,520
 You will count the codes naturally

603
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,400
 We need to get used to it

604
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
 We need to practice

605
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,520
 Because the old thinking is very rigid

606
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,400
 We need to break the old thinking

607
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
 And create a new habit

608
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,880
 We need to learn from our habits

609
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
 Don't let the old thinking come out so easily

610
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
 Ask God first

611
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
 Ask the Heavens

612
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,240
 Or think about

613
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,200
 This habit, this response

614
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 Is it in conflict with the principles of the Bible?

615
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
 We need to practice

616
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,240
 Ask the Heavens more

617
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,040
 Don't let the old thinking come out so easily

618
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,200
 We need the help of the Holy Spirit

619
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,040
 We need the Holy Spirit's reminder

620
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,800
 So that we can have the right choice

621
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,760
 And make a right choice

622
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,720
 Sisters

623
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,120
 We really need the Holy Spirit

624
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,360
 And rely on God

625
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,600
 So that we can live out the Christian lifestyle

626
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,640
 It may not be easy

627
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
 Because we have lived for so many years

628
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,000
 We have so many habits and cultures

629
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 It is hard for us to get rid of them

630
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,800
 But we can change

631
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
 We can practice

632
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 We can practice and change our old habits

633
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,120
 Create a new habit

634
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,120
 A habit that we can rely on the Heavens

635
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
 And pray to God

636
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,320
 Don't rely on yourself

637
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,320
 Lastly, I would like to share my experiences

638
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,320
 The reminders that the Heavens give me in my life

639
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,320
 I am a person who is afraid of doing the wrong things

640
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 Because I always did the wrong things when I was young

641
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
 What would happen if I did the wrong things?

642
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 Have you ever experienced doing the wrong things?

643
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
 Have you ever done the wrong things?

644
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
 Wow, you are really good at it

645
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 You are wrong

646
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,320
 Usually, people will scold you for doing the wrong things

647
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,320
 I was always scolded when I was young

648
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,320
 I have a low self-image

649
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
 I always thought I was a useless person

650
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 I was always criticized

651
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
 So I really want to do well

652
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
 Because I am afraid of doing the wrong things

653
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
 Because I will be scolded if I do the wrong things

654
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
 So I really want to work hard

655
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
 To do better things

656
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 So that I won't be scolded

657
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,320
 But I will bring this pattern or habit

658
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,320
 into my appearance

659
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
 I also have this tendency

660
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 It sounds like nothing

661
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
 But it's not

662
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
 When I really want to do well

663
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
 No matter what I arrange

664
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,320
 Whether it's a meeting or a speech

665
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
 Or if there is a problem in my life

666
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
 I will deal with it immediately

667
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
 I want to think more

668
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
 Plan better

669
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
 Do better

670
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,320
 The best is to deal with all the problems

671
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
 And settle them

672
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
 When I settle all these things

673
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
 I won't feel insecure

674
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 I won't be scolded if I do well

675
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,320
 I will have this pattern of doing things

676
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 Now I am learning

677
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,320
 It's quite tiring to do this all the time

678
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 Doing everything well

679
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 It's tiring for my life

680
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
 Now I am learning

681
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,320
 Do I have to do something immediately?

682
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 Do I have to deal with things immediately?

683
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 Do I have to go beyond all these things?

684
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,320
 Or should I pray first?

685
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,320
 To give up the difficulties I face

686
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 Or the difficulties that the sisters face

687
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 I remember I told the sisters

688
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 At the beginning of the year

689
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 I don't remember if I said this on this platform

690
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
 I remember I said this on React

691
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
 The lesson I want to learn in 2024

692
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 Is to learn to let go

693
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
 I should learn to let go

694
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
 Don't hold on to things so tightly

695
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
 Don't rely on your own efforts

696
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 I have to practice

697
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,320
 How to let go and give to God

698
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,320
 Recently, a brother shared with me

699
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,320
 The situation of his sisters

700
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
 I was very worried

701
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
 Just like me in the past

702
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
 I have a habit of saying

703
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
 "You have a problem? We should talk about it"

704
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
 "We should make an appointment"

705
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
 I said we should make an appointment

706
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
 To solve these problems

707
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
 Don't make the relationship

708
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
 Too tense

709
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
 Or maybe a lot of things are just misunderstandings

710
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
 I hope we can solve it quickly

711
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
 I said we should make an appointment

712
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
 But the brother said

713
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
 "I don't know what to do"

714
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
 "We should try to talk about it"

715
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
 "We are all grown up now"

716
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
 "We are all mature now"

717
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
 "We can try to solve it"

718
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
 He told me not to interfere

719
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
 I thought

720
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
 "Yes, you are all grown up"

721
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
 "You are all mature"

722
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
 "Why can't I trust you with these things?"

723
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
 "I should trust you"

724
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
 "You have the ability to solve it"

725
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
 "You have the ability to solve it"

726
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
 "You have the ability to solve it"

727
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
 "You have the ability to solve it"

728
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
 "I should trust you"

729
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
 "You have the ability to solve it"

730
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
 "Yes, God has mentioned me"

731
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
 "I should trust you"

732
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
 "You have the ability to solve it"

733
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
 "I should learn to let go"

734
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
 To me, it was a new experience

735
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
 To me, it was a new experience

736
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
 It was my habit

737
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
 I jump in when I have something to talk about

738
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
 I jump in when I have something to talk about

739
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 But now I am learning

740
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
 But now I am learning

741
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
 I am learning

742
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
 I give my head to God

743
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
 I realize that

744
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
 I realize that

745
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
 I don't have to do too much

746
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
 I don't have to do too much

747
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
 I have the opportunity to grow

748
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
 I have the opportunity to grow

749
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
 It is a lesson of trust and communication

750
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
 I trust my sisters

751
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
 I trust my sisters

752
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
 They carry a lot of things

753
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
 They carry a lot of things

754
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
 They do things well

755
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
 I trust them

756
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
 I don't know, sisters

757
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
 I don't know, sisters

758
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
 Do you have anything to update?

759
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
 Do you have anything to update?

760
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
 I don't know what word you have created in the beginning of 2024

761
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 I don't know what word you have created in the beginning of 2024

762
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
 It is the end of 2024

763
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
 Do you have any word to create?

764
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
 It is the end of 2024

765
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
 It is the end of 2024

766
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
 I don't know what you have to update

767
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
 I don't know what you have to update

768
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
 I don't know what you have to update

769
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
 I hope you can practice new habits

770
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 I hope you can practice new habits

771
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
 These habits will help you to be closer to God

772

 These habits will help you to be closer to God

773
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
 These habits will help us to leave the darkness

774
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
 These habits will help us to be closer to God

775
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320

777
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
 I don't know if you have any

778
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
 I don't know if you have any

779
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
 Sisters, sometimes I feel it is not easy

780
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
 Sisters, sometimes I feel it is not easy

781
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
 Because we have lived for so many years

782
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
 Many things are very considerate

783
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
 Many things come out naturally

784
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
 There are some ways to respond

785
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
 There are some ways to respond

786
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
 There are some ways to respond

787
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
 But some things, some ways

788
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
 May not be in harmony

789
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
 Maybe these habits

790
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
 May lead us to leave God

791
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
 May lead us to leave God

792
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 We need the Holy Spirit to remind us

793
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
 We need a new perspective

794
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
 A new way

795
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
 To bring Christ out

796
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
 I know it is not easy

797
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 But we can practice

798
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
 But we can practice

799
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
 To make us more accustomed

800
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
 To rely on God

801
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
 Not on ourselves

802
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
 I will put the Bible on the table

803
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
 I will put the Bible on the table

804
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
 Sisters, I don't know

805
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
 What is your life situation?

806
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
 What is your life situation?

807
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
 What is your life situation?

808
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
 Are there any things

809
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
 That make us stay in the darkness?

810
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
 That make us stay in the darkness?

811
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
 Next Sunday is Christmas

812
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
 It is the day of the resurrection of Christ

813
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
 It is the day of the resurrection of Christ

814
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
 Christ is the true light

815
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
 He will shine on the darkness

816
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
 He will shine on the darkness

817
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
 He will shine on those who are trapped

818
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
 He will shine on those who are trapped

819
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
 He will take people out of the darkness

820
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
 He will take people out of the darkness

821
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
 Into a wonderful light

822
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
 Into a wonderful light

823
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
 Into a wonderful light

824
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
