[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.760]   and do many things that are against God's will
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.240]   What St Paul was talking about was not people who did not believe in God
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.520]   He was talking about believers
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.320]   What does the Bible say?
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.400]   He says, 'there shall be no obstacles in your help'
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.600]   When it comes to believers
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   you should no longer be the same as those who did not believe in God
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.400]   You should have left the darkness and sins
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.200]   You should no longer do things that are the same as those who did not believe in God
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.040]   You should not do things that offend God
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.280]   But believers are still in the darkness
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.760]   Why are believers still in the darkness?
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.160]   Why are they separated from God?
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.080]   It is because they are ignorant and stubborn
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.120]   Not only that
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.920]   Let's look at the 19th chapter
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.400]   In the 19th chapter, the New Testament is even more straightforward
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.840]   The New Testament says,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:46.160]   "Since they are ignorant, they should be free to do all kinds of things that are against God's will"
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.560]   What is he talking about?
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.000]   He is talking about people's choices
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.240]   People should be firm in their hearts
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.200]   People should be free to do all kinds of things that are against God's will
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.080]   In English, he says,
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:06.600]   "Greedy to practice every kind of impurity"
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.760]   It means that you want to practice
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.640]   What is he talking about?
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.080]   Not just once
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.920]   It is repeated over and over again
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   These practices may even become a habit
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.840]   It turns out that believers should have left the darkness
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.400]   They should have been in the light
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.680]   But they deliberately chose to break the law
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.360]   They went back to the darkness again and again
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.640]   And separated themselves from God
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.400]   When we look at this, we understand
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   Why did Paul use such a strict, strict, and high-level sermon?
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.720]   Because it is people's will
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.600]   It is people's choice
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.840]   And this kind of life
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.040]   The life of leaving God
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.400]   The life in the darkness
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.800]   Is not able to build the body of Christ
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.080]   To raise Christ to glory
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.280]   But I think
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.600]   There is no reason for believers not to know
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.760]   Why do they fall back into the darkness so easily?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.440]   Or maybe they are not willing to leave the darkness
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.920]   Let's understand what darkness means
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   Darkness means that there is no light
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.960]   God did not make darkness
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.720]   God made light, but lost the light
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.920]   In ancient times, light was generally used
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.200]   To represent rational thinking
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.400]   In Judaism, light represents life
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.200]   It is mentioned in the Bible that light is Jesus himself
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.320]   It is God himself
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.240]   When people lose the light
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.560]   It means that they leave God
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.320]   Their hearts become dark
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.720]   They lose their rational thinking
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.200]   When they lose the light in the darkness
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.280]   Their souls become anxious, anxious, and fearful
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.840]   All kinds of worries come out
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   How do we settle these fears, worries, and pressures?
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.240]   People will do many things to help themselves settle their anxieties
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.120]   And what is the easiest thing to do?
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.160]   It is to do the things in the world
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.320]   It is the easiest thing to do
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.240]   When we can do these things in the world
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.120]   It is really OK
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.400]   We can have a moment of peace
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.360]   We can really settle some things
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.640]   Then we may want to do more
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.280]   We want to do more in the world
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.640]   When we do more in the world
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.520]   The distance between us and God will be further and further
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.920]   When the distance between us and God is further and further
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.160]   What will happen to our hearts?
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.520]   We will continue to be in the darkness
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.760]   When we are in the darkness, the anxiety will come out
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.560]   In the end, we will be in an infinite cycle
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.480]   We will keep practicing this mode
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.560]   So why did the Bible say that our hearts become numb?
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.080]   Because we have been used to practicing
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.840]   We don't know how to find God
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.320]   We are used to being in the darkness
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.120]   Especially when we are under a lot of pressure
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.640]   And when we are in trouble
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.880]   We will easily want to throw up
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.040]   The habit of throwing up
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.080]   Will easily appear in our lives
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.000]   I remember
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.640]   When I was still working at the workplace
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.520]   I remembered my colleagues
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   My colleagues love to drink
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.280]   Of course, drinking is not a crime
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.760]   But I want to say that they don't drink
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.080]   They drink
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.920]   Do you know what drinking is?
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.720]   You know, right?
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.920]   You don't know? I see you are looking away
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.160]   That's great, you are so simple
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.120]   You drink until you are drunk
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.480]   They love to drink
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.840]   They drink when they are happy
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.360]   Because they are happy
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.880]   Drinking makes them happier
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.280]   What if they are not happy?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.800]   They drink even more
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.760]   Because they will be sober after getting drunk
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.280]   They will be drunk
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.680]   They will throw up and talk nonsense
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.560]   Some people will hug and kiss
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   It's scary when a man kisses a woman
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.800]   Why do they drink when they are happy?
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.480]   Why do they drink when they are not happy?
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.360]   I believe
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.760]   They are under a lot of pressure at work
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.080]   They want to solve the pressure immediately
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.480]   They are not happy
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.640]   Drinking is a good way
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.800]   It brings a moment of happiness
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.680]   It brings a moment of happiness
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.280]   I believe they know
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.920]   It's not good for your body to get drunk with alcohol
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.000]   Some people drink until
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.680]   They look like they won't drink anymore
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.400]   They know it's not good, but they are used to it
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.640]   They can't change it
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   They drink because they have to
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.320]   That's why they are happy
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.720]   They have to get drunk
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.880]   To forget their pain
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.000]   I think of young people
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.280]   They are under a lot of pressure
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.480]   At home, in their growth
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.640]   Or in their studies
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.240]   In their relationships
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.680]   They are under a lot of pressure
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.720]   They will use the way of cutting their hands
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.960]   To solve their inner pain
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.160]   They know it's not good to cut their hands
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   It hurts, right?
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.520]   And if they cut their hands
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.800]   They will have to wear long sleeves in summer
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.720]   To cover it
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.880]   They don't dare to wear short sleeves
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.160]   But why do they still cut their hands?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.280]   Because the pain in their heart is too painful
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.960]   They can't solve the pressure and pain
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.240]   They would rather their body's pain
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.360]   Can reduce their inner pain
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.320]   And it seems to work
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.520]   929 is a habit
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.960]   Continuous practice is a habit
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.840]   Yes, sisters
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.720]   I don't know
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.160]   Although we believe in God
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.960]   Our lives are saved by God
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.080]   But are there some things
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.640]   We can't get rid of the darkness?
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.720]   There are some things we should know
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.080]   Don't do it
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.000]   It's offensive to God
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.440]   It's not pleasant
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.880]   But are we using
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.440]   Some thoughts that don't fit God's mind
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.880]   Our way of life
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.800]   To deal with our insecurity?
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.560]   It even becomes our habit
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.240]   So we inadvertently
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.400]   Still stay in the darkness
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.880]   In the darkness
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.120]   And make us
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   Get farther and farther away from God?
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.480]   Sister Ling
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   I don't know what method you are using
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.720]   To deal with your pressure
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   What method
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.280]   To deal with your insecurity?
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.320]   These methods
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.720]   These life styles
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.000]   Have they made you
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.560]   Get farther away from God?
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.280]   Let's continue
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.720]   When we say
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.880]   There are still these old life styles
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.360]   Or these habits
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.760]   That make us fall into the darkness
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.240]   How can we return to the light?
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.440]   In the 20th chapter
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440]   It says
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.960]   "But what you learned from Christ is not like this"
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.640]   "But"
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.320]   Usually
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.240]   The word "but"
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.120]   Is used to make a strong comparison
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.880]   I want to tell the believers
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.000]   Believers
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.640]   You shouldn't be like this
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.000]   You should be like Christ
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.240]   You shouldn't be like what I said
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.840]   Like the believers
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.080]   To be like Christ
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.640]   There is a verse that says
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.000]   I want to use the New Testament to make it clearer
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.960]   The New Testament says
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.200]   "You must have heard of his testimony"
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.120]   "And have received the teaching in him"
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.160]   "For the truth is in Jesus"
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.240]   The Bible uses the word "if"
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.920]   As if it is a conditional sentence
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.000]   A question sentence
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.840]   No
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.360]   This is a very solid statement
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:00.920]   What does it say?
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.520]   "For the truth is in Jesus"
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.520]   "And have received the teaching in him"
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.680]   And "receive"
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.640]   He uses the word "receive"
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.120]   Receive is not just about knowing
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.600]   Or knowing the truth
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.680]   It also includes the truth
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.000]   There is a very special verse
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.440]   He says
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.280]   "The truth is in Jesus"
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.960]   It's very interesting
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.160]   In the book of Paul
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.120]   The name "Jesus"
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.880]   Is not used often
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.480]   Because it is usually used to mean
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.000]   Jesus Christ
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.200]   Or Jesus Christ
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.960]   Or Jesus Christ
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.520]   The name "Jesus"
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.640]   Is very rare in the book of Paul
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.160]   I believe Paul wanted to tell the believers
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.760]   Jesus is a man who can live
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.320]   And speak the truth
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.640]   The believers should follow Jesus
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.040]   The believers should follow Jesus
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   Not just to hear the truth
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.640]   But to listen to the teachings
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.600]   Or to understand
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.560]   And to carry out the teachings
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.000]   The truth
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.520]   Not just to hear
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.320]   But to carry it out
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.480]   Then
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.680]   In 22-24
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.440]   He tells us
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.240]   How to carry out the teachings of Jesus Christ
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   In these three verses
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.520]   There are three uncertainties
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.880]   They are "discard"
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.480]   "renew"
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.560]   And "re-enact"
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.640]   Let's first look at
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.160]   "re-enact" and "discard"
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.720]   Because these two words are actually one word
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.600]   I found that the translation of "New Testament of Japan" is clearer
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.520]   No need to explain so much
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.720]   He says in "New Testament of Japan"
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.520]   "Discard" means to remove the old man
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.800]   This old man belongs to your past lifestyle
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.960]   "Discard" means to follow the old man
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.360]   "Discard" means to follow the old man
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   "The lust of the heart is growing day by day"
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.760]   We need to discard
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.320]   What is "discard"?
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   It's about our old lifestyle
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.720]   Until we no longer follow
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.680]   The lifestyle of the non-believers
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.560]   Or the non-believers
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.720]   Of course
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.440]   Not all non-believers have problems
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.640]   They are all wrong
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.400]   What is he talking about?
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.000]   That lifestyle is to follow the lust of the heart
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.560]   Those who have problems
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.080]   Those who offend God
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.000]   The lifestyle of the non-believers
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.680]   We need to leave
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.760]   If you have the opportunity
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.920]   You can also look at the following 25-32 chapters
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.240]   There are more examples
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.280]   About what is not in line with God's will
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.480]   What is offending God
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.680]   Those things will lead the believers to leave God
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.160]   Farther and farther
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.440]   What do the believers need to do?
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.560]   They need to leave
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.880]   They need to stop this lifestyle
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.280]   Yes, they need to stop
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.080]   They can't have this lifestyle anymore
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.840]   This kind of habit
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.760]   Then we look at "discard"
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.920]   As I said, it's a pair
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.000]   It's like wearing clothes
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.720]   Except for a dirty shirt
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.800]   You need to wear a new shirt
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.400]   What is this shirt?
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   It is to follow the image of God
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.680]   I don't know what you think of when you hear this
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.360]   You should think of God's creator
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.920]   Adam and Eve are made according to God's image
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.200]   Yes, we should be like Adam and Eve
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.120]   Made according to God's image
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.160]   We can be a new person
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.080]   Just like Adam and Eve in the beginning
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   At the time of Eden
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.760]   They are no longer separated from God
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.160]   Very close to God
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.360]   We can live out the purpose of God's creation
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   Our life can live out God's will
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.160]   But because of sin
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.240]   We are separated from God
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.800]   But Jesus Christ's redemption
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.840]   Let us return to God's embrace again
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.960]   Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.640]   Lead us back to God's embrace
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.640]   And the punishment that Jesus suffered
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   And the punishment that Jesus suffered
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.240]   We should live out God's will
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   So that we can return to God's embrace
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.160]   And become holy
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.480]   Yes, we should stop our old behavior
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.320]   Stop, don't do it again
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.920]   We should be a new person
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.560]   We should do the old things
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.680]   Don't do the dirty things
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.480]   But we should do the things that are in harmony with God's will
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.800]   And the last word is
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.040]   "Renew"
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.560]   In English, it means to be renewed in the spirit of your mind
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.280]   It's not just about renewing our mind
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.560]   It's our mind
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.240]   Are we willing to be changed by God?
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.360]   Are we willing to use a new way
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.480]   A renewed way
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.760]   To live out a new person, a new way of life?
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.960]   Why do we need to renew?
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.360]   Why do we need to use new things?
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.600]   Because the old things are not compatible
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.120]   It's like when you upgrade your phone and computer
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.320]   But you don't upgrade, you buy a new one
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.200]   You don't need to update the iOS, right?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.480]   I don't know, I don't know
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.520]   Why do we need to change?
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.160]   To upgrade or to change a new phone or a new computer
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.480]   Because we need to adapt to the new era
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.520]   I have the courage to ask
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.240]   Is there anyone still using their phone
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.120]   To type and type in but not able to go online?
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.640]   Is there anyone still using this type of phone?
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.880]   Watchman, you seem to want to raise your hand
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.160]   We are basically normal
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.040]   Of course, there are some people who really need it
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.440]   Because they have two phones
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.840]   Maybe one of their phones is really just for typing
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.760]   But I believe most of us are using a smartphone
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.480]   Smartphone
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.440]   Yes, because of the need of the times
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.120]   If we are just using a phone for typing
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.800]   Our life is actually quite difficult
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.840]   Just going to a restaurant, you may not be able to eat
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.800]   Because the restaurant is ordering food
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.000]   You have to do the dishes yourself
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.120]   No one serves you
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.440]   Yes
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.480]   Because we need to adapt to a new life
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.520]   So we need to upgrade
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.880]   Yes, today, we believe in God
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.920]   We are new people, we need to upgrade and change
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.120]   Only by being able to adapt to a new life
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.480]   Can we be able to express God's will
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.880]   It's very interesting
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.160]   These three groups of words
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.400]   If we just look at "disappear" and "rebirth"
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.520]   We can understand what they mean
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.200]   But it's very interesting
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.880]   You will find that "disappear" is above
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.040]   "rebirth" is below
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.640]   "rebirth" is in the middle of "disappear"
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.440]   Yes, this is an important expression
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.120]   "rebirth" is very important
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.720]   Because our heart is affecting our brain
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   Our brain is affecting how we walk
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.600]   This is how people should work
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.920]   Your heart is first
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.200]   Think about it
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.800]   If I want to buy a new computer
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.080]   My brain needs to think
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.640]   To decide the price
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.640]   Who is the cheapest
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.120]   Then I will buy it
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   This is how it should work
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.560]   So, the word "rebirth" is in the middle
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.360]   It's very important
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.920]   If we don't want to
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.080]   It's very difficult to take action to coordinate
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.200]   Also, the word "rebirth"
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.760]   The original Chinese character is a present tense
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.480]   Yes, it's very interesting
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.080]   "Disappear" and "rebirth" are past tense
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.920]   The present tense has a continuous meaning
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.240]   It means to keep rebirthing
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.160]   It's not enough to rebirth once
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.240]   We need to keep rebirthing
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.440]   Why?
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.160]   Why do we need to keep rebirthing?
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.840]   I believe it's because
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   Our old habits
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.160]   Our old lifestyle
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.440]   Have been with us for too long
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.880]   These habits are easy to get out of
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.320]   We need to be gifted
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   To keep rebirthing our heart
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   To remind us again
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.600]   How to live out the Christian lifestyle
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.720]   Just like when we go to a restaurant
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.560]   We need to count the K-codes before we order
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.080]   At first, we are not used to it
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.720]   We want to ask the waiters to order
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.320]   But we need to count the codes
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.560]   When we are asked to do so
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.000]   But as we count the codes
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.200]   Maybe today
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.520]   You will count the codes naturally
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.400]   We need to get used to it
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.840]   We need to practice
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.520]   Because the old thinking is very rigid
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.400]   We need to break the old thinking
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.800]   And create a new habit
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.880]   We need to learn from our habits
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.000]   Don't let the old thinking come out so easily
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.240]   Ask God first
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.840]   Ask the Heavens
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.240]   Or think about
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.200]   This habit, this response
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   Is it in conflict with the principles of the Bible?
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   We need to practice
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.240]   Ask the Heavens more
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.040]   Don't let the old thinking come out so easily
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.200]   We need the help of the Holy Spirit
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.040]   We need the Holy Spirit's reminder
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.800]   So that we can have the right choice
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.760]   And make a right choice
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.720]   Sisters
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.120]   We really need the Holy Spirit
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.360]   And rely on God
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.600]   So that we can live out the Christian lifestyle
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.640]   It may not be easy
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.400]   Because we have lived for so many years
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.000]   We have so many habits and cultures
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It is hard for us to get rid of them
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.800]   But we can change
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   We can practice
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   We can practice and change our old habits
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.120]   Create a new habit
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   A habit that we can rely on the Heavens
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.640]   And pray to God
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.320]   Don't rely on yourself
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   Lastly, I would like to share my experiences
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   The reminders that the Heavens give me in my life
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   I am a person who is afraid of doing the wrong things
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   Because I always did the wrong things when I was young
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   What would happen if I did the wrong things?
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   Have you ever experienced doing the wrong things?
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   Have you ever done the wrong things?
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   Wow, you are really good at it
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   You are wrong
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   Usually, people will scold you for doing the wrong things
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   I was always scolded when I was young
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.320]   I have a low self-image
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   I always thought I was a useless person
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   I was always criticized
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.320]   So I really want to do well
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.320]   Because I am afraid of doing the wrong things
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   Because I will be scolded if I do the wrong things
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   So I really want to work hard
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   To do better things
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.320]   So that I won't be scolded
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   But I will bring this pattern or habit
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.320]   into my appearance
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   I also have this tendency
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.320]   It sounds like nothing
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   But it's not
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   When I really want to do well
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   No matter what I arrange
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   Whether it's a meeting or a speech
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.320]   Or if there is a problem in my life
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   I will deal with it immediately
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   I want to think more
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   Plan better
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   Do better
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   The best is to deal with all the problems
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   And settle them
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   When I settle all these things
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   I won't feel insecure
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   I won't be scolded if I do well
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   I will have this pattern of doing things
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   Now I am learning
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   It's quite tiring to do this all the time
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   Doing everything well
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   It's tiring for my life
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   Now I am learning
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   Do I have to do something immediately?
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   Do I have to deal with things immediately?
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   Do I have to go beyond all these things?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   Or should I pray first?
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   To give up the difficulties I face
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   Or the difficulties that the sisters face
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   I remember I told the sisters
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   At the beginning of the year
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   I don't remember if I said this on this platform
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   I remember I said this on React
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   The lesson I want to learn in 2024
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   Is to learn to let go
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   I should learn to let go
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   Don't hold on to things so tightly
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   Don't rely on your own efforts
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   I have to practice
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   How to let go and give to God
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   Recently, a brother shared with me
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   The situation of his sisters
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   I was very worried
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   Just like me in the past
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   I have a habit of saying
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   "You have a problem? We should talk about it"
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   "We should make an appointment"
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   I said we should make an appointment
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   To solve these problems
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   Don't make the relationship
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.320]   Too tense
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   Or maybe a lot of things are just misunderstandings
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   I hope we can solve it quickly
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   I said we should make an appointment
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   But the brother said
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   "I don't know what to do"
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   "We should try to talk about it"
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.320]   "We are all grown up now"
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   "We are all mature now"
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   "We can try to solve it"
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   He told me not to interfere
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   I thought
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.320]   "Yes, you are all grown up"
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   "You are all mature"
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   "Why can't I trust you with these things?"
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   "I should trust you"
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.320]   "You have the ability to solve it"
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   "You have the ability to solve it"
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   "You have the ability to solve it"
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.320]   "You have the ability to solve it"
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   "I should trust you"
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   "You have the ability to solve it"
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   "Yes, God has mentioned me"
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   "I should trust you"
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   "You have the ability to solve it"
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   "I should learn to let go"
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   To me, it was a new experience
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   To me, it was a new experience
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.320]   It was my habit
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   I jump in when I have something to talk about
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   I jump in when I have something to talk about
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   But now I am learning
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   But now I am learning
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   I am learning
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   I give my head to God
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   I realize that
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   I realize that
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   I don't have to do too much
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   I don't have to do too much
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   I have the opportunity to grow
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   I have the opportunity to grow
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   It is a lesson of trust and communication
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   I trust my sisters
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   I trust my sisters
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   They carry a lot of things
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   They carry a lot of things
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   They do things well
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   I trust them
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   I don't know, sisters
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.320]   I don't know, sisters
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.320]   Do you have anything to update?
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   Do you have anything to update?
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   I don't know what word you have created in the beginning of 2024
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   I don't know what word you have created in the beginning of 2024
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   It is the end of 2024
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.320]   Do you have any word to create?
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.320]   It is the end of 2024
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   It is the end of 2024
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   I don't know what you have to update
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   I don't know what you have to update
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   I don't know what you have to update
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   I hope you can practice new habits
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   I hope you can practice new habits
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   These habits will help you to be closer to God
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.320]   These habits will help you to be closer to God
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   These habits will help us to leave the darkness
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   These habits will help us to be closer to God
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   These habits will help us to be closer to God
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   These habits will help us to be closer to God
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   I don't know if you have any
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   I don't know if you have any
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   Sisters, sometimes I feel it is not easy
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.320]   Sisters, sometimes I feel it is not easy
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   Because we have lived for so many years
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   Many things are very considerate
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   Many things come out naturally
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   There are some ways to respond
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   There are some ways to respond
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   There are some ways to respond
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   But some things, some ways
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   May not be in harmony
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   Maybe these habits
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.320]   May lead us to leave God
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   May lead us to leave God
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   We need the Holy Spirit to remind us
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.320]   We need a new perspective
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   A new way
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.320]   To bring Christ out
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   I know it is not easy
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   But we can practice
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   But we can practice
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.320]   To make us more accustomed
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   To rely on God
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   Not on ourselves
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   I will put the Bible on the table
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.320]   I will put the Bible on the table
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.320]   Sisters, I don't know
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   What is your life situation?
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   What is your life situation?
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   What is your life situation?
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   Are there any things
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.320]   That make us stay in the darkness?
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   That make us stay in the darkness?
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.320]   Next Sunday is Christmas
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   It is the day of the resurrection of Christ
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   It is the day of the resurrection of Christ
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.320]   Christ is the true light
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   He will shine on the darkness
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   He will shine on the darkness
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   He will shine on those who are trapped
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   He will shine on those who are trapped
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   He will take people out of the darkness
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   He will take people out of the darkness
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   Into a wonderful light
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.320]   Into a wonderful light
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Into a wonderful light
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   Into your life again?
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   Would you like to invite Christ
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   Into your life again?
