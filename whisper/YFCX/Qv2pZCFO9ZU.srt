1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 Good morning, sisters.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,500
 I think we should give a round of applause to our teachers.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,500
 This is a very good demonstration.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is this demonstration the same?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 I think the most touching thing is the new teaching method.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,700
 The teachers have always been…

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,500
 I have seen it myself,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,900
 especially last week, I went to Dongguan.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,000
 A few churches there invited me to speak

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,300
 about the development, management and education of the church.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,000
 What I told them was that without success, there would be no success.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,400
 But they wanted to know if we could introduce the method to them step by step.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,800
 They even invited our private class.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,000
 This was a few months ago.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,500
 Is it possible to communicate with them?

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,600
 They saw that the worship of the Church of God

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,300
 was continuously created by many new songs, new verses and new verses.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,300
 Secondly, they really appreciated the new songs and new verses

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,000
 brought by the Church of God.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,800
 They were able to prepare the hearts of the people.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,000
 But they didn't see some of the things.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,800
 But they knew that our brothers and sisters went there to help them

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,700
 to teach them how to wear the robe,

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,800
 to teach them how to wear the robe,

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
 to teach them how to love their spouse.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
 Not all of them went.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
 Only our brothers and sisters went.

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,100
 Because of this, they were curious to ask,

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,500
 "How did you do it?"

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,200
 Listen, my brothers and sisters.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,300
 I think everyone knows how to recite the Great Message.

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,200
 Do you know how to recite it?

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
 But whether you know how to interpret the question

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,300
 depends on each person.

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,900
 I think everyone knows

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,000
 that the most important commandment of the Great Message

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,100
 is only one commandment.

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,300
 That is, "Let the people go as they come."

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,500
 How do we do that?

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
 There are three different ways.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,800
 "Go" means not to wait for people to come.

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
 "Going" means to go.

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,200
 You have to go to every different place.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,500
 You have to go to the place where people are staying.

45
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,200
 You have to find the people

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,500
 and bring the Great Message to them.

47
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,300
 But don't give it to them so easily.

48
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,300
 Once you believe, you have to help them wash the dishes.

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,500
 You have to warm up their foundation.

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,700
 If the foundation is not warmed up,

51
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,200
 they will become a woman.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
 The same is true for Christians.

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,500
 Why do I believe?

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,000
 Unless they have become disciples,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,300
 we will baptize them.

56
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,700
 We will baptize them.

57
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,700
 They will be integrated into the life of the Church

58
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,000
 and become a part of the body.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
 But in the body,

60
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,700
 every body has a function.

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
 Do you agree, Brother Deng?

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,800
 If there is anything useless in your body,

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
 you can cut it off.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
 No.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 There is nothing useless.

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
 "Doctor, I think the ears are ugly.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,300
 Can you cut them off?"

68
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,800
 "The nose is ugly. It's so high.

69
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,200
 Can you cut it off?"

70
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,800
 "My hands are better than my legs.

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
 My legs are useless.

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,900
 Can you cut them off?"

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,100
 "What are the nails for?"

74
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,200
 "Why don't you make them all out and make them look better?"

75
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
 I tell you,

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,300
 it is impossible to cut them off.

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,600
 Everything has its function.

78
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,900
 In today's Church,

79
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,500
 we hope that everyone in the Church

80
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,300
 can see that everyone who comes to the Church

81
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,700
 has a function.

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,200
 Nothing is useless.

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
 Everything is very important.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,300
 I have told people many times

85
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,000
 what attracts a newcomer to the Church

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,700
 and keeps coming.

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,200
 The first impression.

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,300
 When they come,

89
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
 they look at our Sister Deng.

90
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
 Are they very enthusiastic?

91
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,600
 When they come,

92
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,100
 they are very active in meeting and greeting them.

93
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,200
 They never say,

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,400
 "Where is your toilet?"

95
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
 Then they respond,

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,900
 "Go and find it."

97
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,900
 I tell you,

98
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,400
 if you have this attitude,

99
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,000
 they will not come again.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
 Unless you say,

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
 "I will take you there."

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,100
 You take them there and bring them back.

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,200
 I tell you,

104
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,700
 this impression

105
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,200
 makes them very impressed.

106
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
 They will feel that

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,700
 they will definitely come back.

108
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,100
 It is not that they decide after hearing the pastor's words.

109
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,300
 It is from the first day of the meeting.

110
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,800
 If you are a person of grace,

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
 a body,

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
 you should do your best

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
 to greet them,

114
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
 to treat them,

115
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
 to care for them,

116
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,700
 to love them.

117
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,100
 Any brother or sister,

118
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,800
 when they have this need,

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,700
 we will immediately,

120
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,300
 for their needs,

121
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,900
 find a suitable person

122
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,300
 at the right time

123
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,800
 to do the right thing

124
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,900
 to help them.

125
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,100
 This is what we should do.

126
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
 In the past two weeks,

127
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,000
 the number of people who have asked for help has been increasing.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,400
 A year ago,

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,500
 the director of the Chinese Academy of Medicine,

130
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 Dr. Liang Jialun,

131
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,800
 had already contacted me.

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,600
 He said that he had opened a new Chinese Academy in Rome.

133
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,100
 In this new Chinese Academy,

134
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,600
 he wanted to teach the Bible.

135
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,000
 Many people could help him.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,600
 Many people could help him teach the Bible.

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,400
 But when it comes to the development of the Church,

138
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,200
 the establishment of the Church,

139
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
 he thought about it.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,800
 No one could help him.

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
 So two years ago,

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,900
 he told me,

143
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
 "Dr. Song,

144
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,400
 can you come?"

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
 I asked, "How can I come?"

146
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,900
 "You come for half a year."

147
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,100
 This is what their teaching is like.

148
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
 They come for half a year.

149
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,200
 After half a year,

150
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,100
 Italy does not allow them to stay for more than half a year.

151
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,300
 They have to leave.

152
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,200
 After they leave,

153
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
 they go back again half a year later.

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
 After they leave, they go back again for half a year.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
 I told him,

156
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 "Dr. Liang,

157
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
 I have two Chinese Academy.

158
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
 I can't leave."

159
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,200
 The first one is the Chinese Academy of Medicine,

160
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,500
 the second one is the Chinese Academy of Medicine,

161
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 I kept mentioning it.

162
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,600
 If you want me to go there for a month in a row,

163
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,200
 I can't do it.

164
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,300
 Because in fact,

165
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,500
 I need to teach

166
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,400
 everything I do.

167
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
 I need to teach.

168
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,100
 After he heard it,

169
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,800
 he told me last year,

170
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,300
 "Dr. Song, I know you can't stay for so long,

171
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,200
 but can you open your mind?"

172
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
 How to open your mind?

173
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,700
 "You come for 10 days."

174
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,300
 "10 days intensive."

175
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,600
 It means a dense course.

176
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
 "Come and help our students."

177
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,900
 Because of this reason,

178
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
 two weeks ago,

179
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,400
 I promised him to go to Rome.

180
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
 When I went to Rome,

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I didn't just teach in his Chinese Academy.

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,800
 He also arranged a nearby

183
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,300
 Roman Chinese Academy.

184
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,800
 But there is a church in Petrova.

185
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
 Petrova is

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,200
 a train station that is 3.5 to 4 hours away from Rome.

187
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,400
 He said that church is worth helping.

188
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,200
 So I went to Petrova.

189
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,300
 When I went to Petrova,

190
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,500
 I found that this church

191
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,600
 has 300 to 400 people.

192
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,800
 But what I really admire about them

193
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,100
 is that 85% of the people

194
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,900
 are under 40 years old.

195
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,200
 I tell you,

196
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
 today, you can't find a church

197
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,300
 in the whole world

198
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,600
 that is so young and energetic.

199
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
 Second,

200
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,400
 this church serves

201
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,000
 a businessman,

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
 an elder,

203
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,600
 no priest,

204
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,300
 all are believers.

205
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,500
 And their believers

206
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,300
 are not only working,

207
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,300
 but also serving in the church.

208
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,000
 But the only problem is

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,900
 that there is no one who is always serving them,

210
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,400
 training people to serve.

211
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,300
 Many of them can't make it.

212
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,100
 They are worried that the church will be lost.

213
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,500
 So when I went there,

214
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,600
 a sister told me that

215
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,100
 recently there is a new heaven and earth church.

216
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,400
 Some people invited them to go there.

217
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
 She asked, "What is a new heaven and earth church?"

218
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,100
 She saw that they are good people

219
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,300
 and helped this and helped that.

220
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,400
 So she brought some people there.

221
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
 When I heard that,

222
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,300
 I was very worried.

223
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,600
 I told her,

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
 "Do you know what a new heaven and earth church is?"

225
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,400
 "I want to ask you."

226
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
 "Do you know what a new heaven and earth church is?"

227
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,000
 "If you know, raise your hand."

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,300
 I think we are all just daydreaming.

229
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,700
 The new heaven and earth church

230
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,400
 is the most dangerous

231
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,800
 and even the most evil church in South Korea.

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,300
 They said that the new heaven and earth church has already come

233
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,700
 and is in our church.

234
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,500
 So you join our church

235
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,200
 and enjoy the new heaven and earth church.

236
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,100
 When I heard that,

237
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
 I was very worried.

238
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,500
 They are so serious

239
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,300
 and so vague.

240
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,000
 But the pastor and the pastor's wife

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
 don't know what it is.

242
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,300
 Secondly,

243
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,800
 they had two or three churches

244
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,200
 that were very close.

245
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,100
 They went to church and together.

246
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,200
 They all gathered together.

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,500
 They all gathered together

248
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,100
 so that they could go to church very soon.

249
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,500
 But since last year,

250
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 there was a church

251
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 and the pastor told them,

252
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,300
 "We will not cooperate with you."

253
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
 "You come to our church

254
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,000
 and we come to your church."

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,300
 "Because recently,

256
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,000
 there was a member of our church,

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
 I don't know his name,

258
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,700
 he is very capable

259
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,400
 and he is very capable in healing."

260
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,900
 "After hearing all these,

261
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,600
 he looks like a new believer."

262
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,100
 So I asked them,

263
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,000
 "Do they know how to speak in dialect?"

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
 They said, "Pastor, how do you know?"

265
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,900
 I told them,

266
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,700
 "The most dangerous movement now

267
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,900
 is the New Testament Movement."

268
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,700
 When I spoke,

269
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,100
 when they heard me,

270
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,000
 they added one more lesson.

271
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,500
 I had already said and done everything.

272
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,300
 The night before I left,

273
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,700
 I had to give them two hours

274
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,700
 to talk to us.

275
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,300
 We need training.

276
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,500
 How do you train us?

277
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,300
 I told my younger sister,

278
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,000
 "After I went to Rome,

279
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,500
 after I went to Dongguan,

280
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,200
 I found that all the problems

281
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,300
 are related to the understanding of the Word of God

282
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,100
 and how to describe the Word of God.

283
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,200
 How do we find a suitable factory

284
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,100
 to train them?"

285
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,600
 When I was in the church,

286
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,300
 I met a group of preachers

287
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,000
 who were preachers in France.

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,200
 They had a one-year trial period,

289
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
 but it was not enough.

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,800
 The church told them,

291
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,200
 "We don't want to continue."

292
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
 The group of preachers

293
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,300
 came back to Hong Kong or Malaysia.

294
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,600
 They were in Malaysia,

295
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,400
 but they had been in Hong Kong for six years.

296
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,000
 They went to this church to learn.

297
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,700
 I happened to be there to teach.

298
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,500
 Both of them came.

299
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,600
 After they came,

300
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,800
 they told me

301
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,100
 that the church in their hearts was unhappy

302
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
 and that their約 was not yet full.

303
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,300
 They did not want to continue.

304
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,100
 I asked them why.

305
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,000
 They told me that the church was in France.

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 In the French church,

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,300
 in the meeting,

308
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,400
 one-third of the people

309
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,700
 were French.

310
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,300
 They spoke French.

311
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,400
 The meeting was to teach French to the sisters.

312
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,500
 They all spoke French.

313
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,000
 But none of the preachers

314
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,400
 knew a single French word.

315
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,300
 I asked, "If you don't know French,

316
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,100
 does that mean you don't have a license?"

317
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,700
 They said, "Yes, we don't."

318
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,000
 I asked, "How do you open a meeting?"

319
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 They said, "Someone will translate for you."

320
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,700
 "You go to visit people,

321
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,800
 but you don't know how to drive a car.

322
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
 How do you go?"

323
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,200
 They said, "Someone will drive you."

324
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,300
 I realized that if that was the case,

325
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,700
 you would be blind,

326
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,300
 and you wouldn't be able to see French.

327
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,900
 You would be deaf, and you wouldn't be able to hear French.

328
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,500
 You would be mute, and you wouldn't be able to speak French.

329
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 You would be deaf.

330
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,600
 I told them,

331
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,700
 "Brother,

332
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,200
 I don't think you should blame the church,

333
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,000
 but you should blame your missionary organization.

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,700
 When our missionaries join the OMF,

335
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,900
 they need to learn the language for at least two years.

336
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,500
 After learning, they need to pass the test,

337
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,600
 and then they can go to the factory.

338
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,500
 How can you do that so quickly?"

339
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,800
 I told them,

340
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,500
 "I encourage you to think about

341
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 using your own language

342
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,800
 to serve in the places you go to.

343
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,200
 Don't waste your time.

344
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,400
 It's not worth it."

345
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,900
 Dear brothers and sisters,

346
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,900
 today I am here to talk about

347
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:01,000
 the importance of "the living and the dying."

348
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,700
 Let's take a look at this PowerPoint.

349
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,400
 1 Timothy 2, 1-6.

350
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,000
 I would like to show you

351
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,700
 how the Bible uses this great mission

352
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,800
 in their actual lives.

353
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,900
 Let's read together.

354
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
 "I tell you,

355
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,700
 you must be strong in the one side of Jesus Christ.

356
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,500
 You must hear my teaching in front of many witnesses.

357
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,700
 You must be faithful and faithful

358
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,000
 to be able to teach others."

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,900
 This is the Bible.

360
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,000
 You can see

361
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,500
 that the most important thing is the living and the dying.

362
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,700
 Paul explains it very clearly.

363
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,300
 He tells Timothy,

364
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,100
 "Timothy, you must be strong in the one side of Jesus Christ."

365
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,700
 If you pay attention,

366
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,400
 both the later and earlier books of Timothy

367
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,700
 are very personal books

368
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,100
 especially given to Paul and Suleiman.

369
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,200
 One of the sons is Timothy,

370
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
 and the other is Tithon.

371
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,700
 But these two books are different.

372
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
 The content of the books

373
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,100
 is very different from that of Tithon and Timothy.

374
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,800
 The tone of the words is also different.

375
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,700
 Why?

376
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,000
 Because it is very simple.

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,100
 Paul knew these two sons.

378
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,800
 He even knew their personalities.

379
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
 Timothy was a good boy.

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,500
 Timothy was a relatively weak person.

381
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,100
 He was introverted.

382
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,700
 He grew up in a Christian family.

383
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,300
 But the problem was that he had not gone through the storm.

384
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,400
 Because of this reason,

385
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
 what did he need most?

386
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,300
 He saw him.

387
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,200
 What you need most is actual experience.

388
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:51,300
 The appearance you get from your mother's faith

389
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,600
 is completely correct.

390
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,900
 But is it enough?

391
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,500
 Paul tells him, "You are not strong."

392
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,100
 Because of this,

393
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,000
 when he saw this family living for a very short time,

394
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,900
 he felt their bottom.

395
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 What is the bottom?

396
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,300
 It is not just social relations.

397
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,500
 "Have you eaten?"

398
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,400
 "Good morning."

399
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,300
 "How are you?"

400
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,900
 "I am fine."

401
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,400
 No.

402
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,900
 It is not even a deep relationship.

403
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
 A deep relationship means

404
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,300
 that you know the deep things in your heart.

405
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,400
 You know how their original family is.

406
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,500
 Paul had to enter the spiritual realm.

407
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,400
 In our group today,

408
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,100
 I want to tell you

409
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,300
 not to pretend

410
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,500
 that no one knows your original family.

411
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,900
 Your struggle,

412
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,800
 your struggle in the spiritual realm,

413
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,500
 we have to enter the spiritual realm.

414
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,800
 We have to use the words of God,

415
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,100
 our experience,

416
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,700
 the experience of some brothers and sisters,

417
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,000
 and the experience of the ancestors.

418
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,900
 We have to encourage each other.

419
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,100
 This is what we have to do today.

420
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,300
 So we can see clearly here

421
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,100
 that Paul is applying the Great Mission.

422
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
 Go.

423
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,900
 Go to this home.

424
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,200
 Then put the needs of this home

425
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,600
 in your heart.

426
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,800
 Then, based on the needs he knows,

427
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
 based on the different people,

428
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,400
 give different instructions.

429
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
 This is why

430
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 after following Paul,

431
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,900
 there was a great experience.

432
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,100
 In the church of Philippians,

433
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,200
 after he drove away the demons,

434
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
 he was persecuted and imprisoned.

435
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
 Throughout the whole process,

436
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 from beginning to end, he was persecuted.

437
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,300
 How did Paul meet the Lord in prison?

438
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,200
 The Lord knew.

439
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,700
 Today, I will first show you

440
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,900
 Paul's attitude towards the Lord

441
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,400
 in the "The Message of the New Life"

442
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,700
 He said to the Lord,

443
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,800
 "Lord,

444
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,900
 I am your son.

445
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,400
 You must know

446
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,400
 that you have to listen to what I teach

447
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,900
 in front of many witnesses.

448
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,000
 You must also teach those who are faithful and can teach others."

449
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,800
 There are four generations of hermits here.

450
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
 Paul was the first generation.

451
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
 Timothy was the second generation.

452
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,300
 Those who are faithful and can teach others

453
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,200
 were the third generation.

454
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,400
 Then there were others, the fourth generation.

455
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,200
 They must be in the fire of the Lord.

456
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,800
 I am very grateful to see our disciples today.

457
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,400
 They have the fire of the Lord.

458
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,000
 How did the masters come?

459
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Through training.

460
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,800
 The Bible says

461
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,700
 that our patriarchs did the same thing.

462
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,400
 Every year,

463
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,800
 a shepherd would come with me.

464
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,300
 Or a pair of shepherds would come with me.

465
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,100
 After the shepherd,

466
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,800
 the next would be the patriarch.

467
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,500
 After the patriarch,

468
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,600
 the new life,

469
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 the "re-education of values" would come.

470
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
 These people came out

471
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,800
 and became members of the group.

472
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 Can we divide into two groups?

473
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
 Can we divide into four groups?

474
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,400
 We kept dividing

475
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
 until we had soldiers to use.

476
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,400
 Dear brothers and sisters,

477
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,000
 the patriarchs were like this.

478
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
 Three groups.

479
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 What happened?

480
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
 We had three groups of leaders.

481
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
 We had a deputy leader.

482
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,000
 Then we had a team.

483
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,400
 One more thing,

484
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 the disciples.

485
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,100
 In the past,

486
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,000
 we had this arrangement.

487
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Every person in the three groups

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 had two or three disciples

489
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,600
 to preach for them.

490
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,800
 After preaching, you would be the leader.

491
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,000
 What was the purpose of the disciples?

492
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,600
 The purpose was to become members of the three groups.

493
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
 After being members,

494
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,400
 they would be on the team.

495
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
 Then they would be deputy leaders.

496
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
 Then they would be leaders.

497
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
 The new life.

498
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
 You may ask,

499
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
 "Why is that?"

500
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
 Because it's very simple.

501
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,600
 The disciples had experienced it.

502
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,400
 In the past, we didn't have this arrangement.

503
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,400
 What was the result?

504
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,000
 Let's look at the 18th chapter of the Book of Genesis.

505
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,200
 This chapter left a deep impression on me.

506
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,200
 It was around 32 years ago.

507
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,200
 32 years ago, in 1992 or 1991,

508
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
 we decided to form a small group to lead the church.

509
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
 The main reason was

510
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,800
 that we had 100 disciples at the beginning.

511
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
 In the second year, we had more than 200 disciples.

512
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,400
 In the third year, we had 300 or 400 disciples.

513
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
 But at that time,

514
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
 there were only two preachers.

515
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
 How could we raise so many people?

516
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,800
 Moreover,

517
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
 the people of the Holy See were very good at choosing.

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
 They would find a deputy leader.

519
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
 They would find someone from the Hong Kong TV station,

520
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,800
 meaning the Hong Kong TV station,

521
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,600
 who was the most helpful to us.

522
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,000
 They would find him.

523
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,800
 So I invited two preachers to find me.

524
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
 I invited four preachers.

525
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
 They found me again.

526
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
 The result was

527
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,200
 exactly the same as Moses' experience.

528
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
 His father told him,

529
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,400
 "Moses, you can't do it like this.

530
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,200
 One by one, they are lining up to find you,

531
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,400
 to break up the discipline.

532
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,200
 What is the result?

533
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,600
 How many disciples do you have?

534
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,400
 Two million.

535
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
 You have to find thousands of people.

536
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
 You have to line up.

537
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
 Why do you have to line up?

538
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,600
 Because it's not your turn yet.

539
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 Moses was the only one to be a deputy leader,

540
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,200
 to arrange and break up the discipline.

541
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
 So he was lining up from morning to night.

542
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,400
 Moses had to be a deputy leader from morning to night,

543
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,000
 to do all kinds of different things.

544
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
 His father told him,

545
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,400
 "The result of your doing this,

546
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,200
 first, you will burn out.

547
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,000
 Second, the people will rush out.

548
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,800
 Third, sooner or later, everyone will die out."

549
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 After I saw Moses,

550
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 I had a very deep impression.

551
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 It was because of this that I reminded myself,

552
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,600
 "So, Moses,

553
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,000
 do you want to be the only one acting,

554
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,400
 and the rest of the people watching,

555
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
 and the result of your doing this,

556
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
 you will burn out,

557
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,600
 and the rest of the people will rush out?

558
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
 In the end,

559
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,600
 all the people in the assembly,

560
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
 including you,

561
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
 will all die out?"

562
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,600
 I was in agony.

563
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,000
 I decided to do one thing.

564
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,600
 I decided to group up the whole church.

565
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,400
 I formed a small group to share the burden.

566
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,000
 I gathered my strength.

567
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
 The church members gathered their strength

568
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
 to form a group.

569
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,400
 Once the group was formed,

570
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,000
 the group leader would lead the group.

571
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 The group leader would lead the group.

572
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 First,

573
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 the first group to benefit from this

574
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 was the church members themselves.

575
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Some say, "Learning is not enough."

576
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
 But what we actually see is,

577
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,600
 "Teaching is not enough."

578
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,200
 When we go to preach,

579
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,600
 when we form a group,

580
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,800
 we see where we are lacking.

581
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,000
 You go to read,

582
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,200
 you go to write,

583
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
 you go to listen,

584
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,800
 and even when you are pre-studying,

585
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,600
 when the church leaders are doing the pre-study,

586
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,000
 you will be distracted.

587
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
 You won't be sleeping.

588
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 You will be writing everything down.

589
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,000
 The reason is that you need to form a group.

590
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
 Dear brothers and sisters,

591
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,200
 have you seen your responsibilities?

592
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
 Your children,

593
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,800
 your families,

594
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,000
 your grandchildren.

595
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Recently, I received a message from a brother,

596
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Wallace, who is a member of the "Patriarchal Family."

597
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
 And his wife.

598
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,200
 When they returned to the US,

599
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 their eldest grandson came to check.

600
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
 He was diagnosed with a blood clot.

601
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,200
 Then, their eldest grandson, eldest son, and eldest granddaughter

602
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,400
 came to check their values.

603
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,800
 Then, they went to several different churches

604
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,600
 to help them form a group.

605
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,400
 I felt "Hallelujah" in my heart.

606
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,200
 I was filled with gratitude for this brother.

607
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:27,200
 Also, he helped us to watch over the owner of the building.

608
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,400
 I don't know if you have seen that video.

609
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,200
 He said, "I am your descendant."

610
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,000
 Why?

611
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
 "I am the disciple of Bass."

612
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
 Bass, the elder, can you stand up?

613
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,800
 Let's give Bass a round of applause.

614
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:44,400
 Bass, please stand up.

615
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,200
 When Bass was working for the government,

616
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
 this owner, Kwong Ching Wai,

617
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,000
 was his subordinate.

618
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 He was an official.

619
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 He went to check on Wai Cheng's estate.

620
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,600
 When he arrived, he was very concerned about him.

621
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,200
 Why did he have so many worries?

622
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,000
 He started to drink with his whole family.

623
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,200
 In order to make Wai Cheng believe him,

624
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
 he said, "I believe you."

625
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,200
 It was just a cover-up.

626
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,800
 But he did not let go of this cover-up.

627
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
 He said, "You have been here once.

628
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
 You said you believed me.

629
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,000
 Why don't you go to his church with my master?"

630
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
 Where was the church?

631
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,000
 It was in the side of Fang Fang,

632
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,200
 in the Yin Fu Tang.

633
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,800
 He came for the first time.

634
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,000
 When he came for the first time,

635
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,600
 he just said, "The 10th and 6th precepts are that one cannot kill."

636
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
 "That's great!"

637
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
 Wai Cheng said that.

638
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,200
 I don't want to say it again.

639
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,800
 But I was very touched.

640
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,200
 This brother, Kwong Ching Wai,

641
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,800
 after learning the "One Drop of Blood",

642
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,000
 he went back to the U.S. Embassy in Singapore.

643
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,400
 He started to lead the group from that time.

644
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,200
 He led the group in doing business,

645
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,400
 in doing everything.

646
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
 He led the group in the elders.

647
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
 Until now,

648
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,000
 he has not changed.

649
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
 He leads a few,

650
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,800
 a dozen "One Drop of Blood" groups every year.

651
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,400
 I am very grateful.

652
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,200
 This brother is a faithful person.

653
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,800
 Now, let's see

654
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,600
 how we can spread the gospel.

655
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
 First, we need to study.

656
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 Study is,

657
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,800
 as long as Paul teaches,

658
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 you need to teach those who are faithful and can teach others.

659
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,400
 You need to find suitable people to teach them.

660
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
 Until everything I teach you,

661
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
 you tell them everything.

662
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
 But is it enough?

663
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 No.

664
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,600
 Finally, let's look at the 3rd precept.

665
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,200
 It's not just about preaching.

666
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
 From the 3rd precept to the 6th precept,

667
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
 the subject is too exaggerated.

668
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
 Let's read it together.

669
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
 You must be like me.

670
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 Next page, please.

671
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,200
 Yes, I will read it together.

672
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,400
 You must be like me,

673
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,800
 suffer together,

674
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
 as a Christian soldier of Jesus.

675
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,600
 Those who are in the army

676
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,800
 cannot be arrogant.

677
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,600
 It is better to let the people in the army be happy.

678
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,800
 When the athletes are competing,

679
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,600
 they cannot be proud of their ability,

680
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,200
 but they must be hard-working.

681
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,400
 Let me tell you,

682
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,600
 preaching is absolutely necessary.

683
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,400
 In Timothy's family,

684
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
 his mother and his grandmother

685
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,200
 were very important to him.

686
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,400
 He saw the faith in his mother and grandmother.

687
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
 What is this faith?

688
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
 It is not hypocritical at all.

689
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,000
 What did he believe?

690
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,400
 What did he do?

691
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,600
 What did he say?

692
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 What did he do?

693
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:59,000
 This is the example of his mother and grandmother.

694
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 So the word "inconsistency"

695
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,400
 is not a hypocrisy.

696
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,600
 It is not a big talk.

697
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,800
 It is something that can be said and done.

698
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,400
 Dear brothers and sisters,

699
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,000
 you must know that

700
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,800
 your children,

701
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
 your grandchildren,

702
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,200
 they are always against

703
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
 the students who do not believe.

704
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,200
 Secondly, they are against the teachers who do not believe.

705
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 How can you influence them?

706
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
 By church?

707
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,400
 They come to church for one, one hour, two hours a week.

708
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
 Can you change their past?

709
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,800
 Absolutely not.

710
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
 How can you influence them?

711
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,000
 It depends on how you treat them at home.

712
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,600
 If they see that you are very different from others,

713
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 from the aunties and uncles that they know,

714
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,400
 I tell them,

715
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,200
 "It is very difficult for you to make them not believe in our Lord."

716
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,400
 I have seen it. I have shared it with my friends.

717
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,600
 I have been to my friends' homes.

718
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,000
 "Wow, they are all rude when they eat."

719
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,400
 "Dad is rude."

720
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,000
 "Mom is rude too."

721
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,600
 Then the children take their food and go to the TV.

722
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,800
 They have nothing to talk about.

723
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,400
 When they go to drink tea, they take a newspaper.

724
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
 They don't talk at all.

725
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
 But we are not like that.

726
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,800
 We don't break our fingers.

727
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
 They feel very different.

728
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,000
 Then their classmates come to our home.

729
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,200
 I tell them, "Your home is very strange."

730
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,000
 They ask, "How is it strange?"

731
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,200
 "Why do you all hold hands and pray?"

732
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
 "When you eat, you give me food, I give you food."

733
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,400
 "Why are you so busy?"

734
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,800
 "That is love."

735
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,200
 But he said,

736
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,200
 "I like your home very much."

737
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,000
 He likes our home.

738
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,800
 I am very grateful.

739
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,000
 His classmates.

740
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,400
 Many of them came to our church.

741
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
 They are all men.

742
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Why?

743
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,600
 Because they saw

744
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
 something that his home did not have.

745
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,800
 Something that he did not have.

746
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,400
 Something that he did not care about.

747
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,200
 Dear brothers and sisters,

748
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
 don't think that when we are at home,

749
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,800
 you are like this.

750
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,200
 You don't say anything, you don't do anything.

751
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,800
 Your son or daughter will become a believer.

752
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
 And become a disciple.

753
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 That is impossible.

754
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,400
 Unless we are in the Church of the New Testament and the Church of the Old Testament,

755
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,400
 we are allowed to see that we are living

756
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,800
 and that is what we believe.

757
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,000
 We are living what we believe.

758
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,200
 We are attracted to it.

759
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,800
 Listen to my sermon.

760
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,600
 Let's try to see.

761
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 Paul was like this.

762
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,400
 Thimolthi was like this.

763
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
 Let's come and see.

764
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,200
 In the New Testament, Paul told him,

765
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,000
 "You will suffer with me."

766
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,200
 Don't think that if you believe, you will be a believer.

767
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,800
 No.

768
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:19,600
 Then Thimolthi thought of how Paul was imprisoned.

769
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 One by one, he cried and cried.

770
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
 He was very unhappy.

771
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,400
 But when Paul entered the prison,

772
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,600
 he preached, sang, and praised God.

773
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
 He was beaten up by more than 40 people.

774
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,200
 They took off their clothes and came to beat him.

775
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,400
 After the beating, they put the two legs of the wooden dog on the metal chain.

776
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,800
 They tied them up.

777
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,200
 But what did they do when they entered?

778
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,200
 They sang, preached, and praised God.

779
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
 I want to ask you.

780
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,600
 They took off their clothes, beat him,

781
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 and then they were put in the prison.

782
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,400
 They were very heavy prisoners.

783
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
 They were locked up.

784
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,000
 If you were in there, would you preach?

785
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,400
 Most people would.

786
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,000
 What did you preach?

787
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,400
 "Lord, you have sinned against me."

788
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,200
 "People in your world have come to wrong me."

789
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
 "Punish them."

790
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
 Is this how you preach?

791
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,400
 "Let me get out of here quickly."

792
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,200
 Is this how you preach?

793
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
 No.

794
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
 Second, you sang.

795
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,800
 Can you sing?

796
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,600
 Third, you praised God.

797
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,800
 Can you praise God?

798
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,400
 I believe that when you are in there,

799
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,200
 it is easier to pray to God.

800
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,000
 It is very difficult to praise God.

801
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,200
 But Paul, the prisoner of Syria,

802
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,400
 was locked up like this.

803
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
 What was the result?

804
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,400
 The whole prison was full of prisoners.

805
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,000
 It was shocking.

806
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Why were these two prisoners locked up so easily?

807
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,200
 So everyone was questioning what they were singing and preaching.

808
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,600
 Then God performed a miracle.

809
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
 The doors were broken.

810
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,000
 The iron chains were broken.

811
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,200
 But no one died.

812
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
 Think about it.

813
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,800
 How many earthquakes

814
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,600
 would shake your watch to the ground?

815
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
 Can you think about it?

816
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,400
 How many earthquakes?

817
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
 Not even ten.

818
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
 If you were broken,

819
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,000
 your watch would shake.

820
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,800
 I am sure it was not an earthquake.

821
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 It was a miracle.

822
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,200
 And at this miracle,

823
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,800
 the prison warden fell asleep.

824
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,400
 It was a big problem.

825
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,600
 When he woke up, he realized that he could not be saved.

826
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,200
 He could not go back.

827
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,600
 He wanted to die.

828
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,800
 What did Paul do?

829
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,000
 Today, we will look at

830
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,400
 how deeply the faith that can be seen

831
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,800
 was affected.

832
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,400
 First, the faith that can be seen.

833
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,800
 Paul saw the body of the man.

834
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,200
 He asked people to throw stones at him.

835
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,600
 But he prayed,

836
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,000
 "Don't give them the sin."

837
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,600
 Then he fell asleep.

838
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,000
 Second, he saw the Lord's resurrection.

839
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,200
 He showed it to him.

840
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,600
 The 15th chapter of the Gospels,

841
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,000
 the 8th chapter begins.

842
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,800
 He saw it with his own eyes.

843
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
 Third,

844
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,800
 the 14th chapter of the Book of Mormon.

845
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,200
 He experienced it himself.

846
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,800
 He was beaten with stones.

847
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,600
 People thought he was dead.

848
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,200
 He was dragged out of the city.

849
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,000
 But he woke up.

850
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
 When he woke up,

851
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,000
 he did not run away so quickly.

852
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,400
 He entered the city again.

853
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
 Look at him.

854
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
 He entered the city again.

855
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
 What did he do?

856
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,000
 He preached.

857
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,200
 Then,

858
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,400
 the 16th chapter of the Book of Mormon.

859
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,200
 This is the case of being wronged.

860
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,600
 After the miracle happened,

861
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,400
 the man wanted to commit suicide.

862
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,000
 I think as a prison guard,

863
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 when you saw him taking a knife to commit suicide,

864
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,600
 you would not say a word.

865
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,400
 You would watch him die.

866
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,600
 Then you would leave.

867
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,400
 Would you?

868
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,600
 You would watch him die.

869
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,200
 You would watch him die.

870
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,400
 After he died,

871
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,000
 you would leave.

872
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,800
 But Paul did not.

873
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,200
 He shouted,

874
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,600
 "Do not die!"

875
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,800
 "We are all here!"

876
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
 He said this

877
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,200
 to the prison guard.

878
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,000
 "I do not want you to die."

879
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,800
 "I would rather die."

880
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,000
 Because this prisoner

881
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,200
 could be executed at any time.

882
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,000
 He was in a prison cell.

883
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,600
 There was no chance to make a statement at that time.

884
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,800
 He could do whatever he wanted.

885
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
 But Paul,

886
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,000
 he was shouting for him.

887
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,200
 The prison guard,

888
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,000
 at that time,

889
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,200
 could not explain

890
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,400
 why there was such a prison guard.

891
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,600
 "You could have watched me die."

892
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,600
 "Why did you shout for me?"

893
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,000
 He was surprised.

894
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
 So he asked,

895
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 "How can I be saved?"

896
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,800
 Paul told him,

897
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,000
 "When you believe in Jesus Christ,

898
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,800
 you and your family will be saved."

899
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,200
 So, because of this reason,

900
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
 the prison guard believed in Jesus Christ,

901
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,400
 so he took him out

902
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
 and brought him home.

903
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
 He served them food,

904
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
 washed their feet,

905
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,600
 and was also washed.

906
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
 The whole family was washed.

907
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,800
 "Are you sure you will die?"

908
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
 "The authorities are coming to find you."

909
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,400
 "Why are two heavy prisoners missing?"

910
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
 "One is called Paul, the other is called Sarah."

911
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,600
 "They went to the prison guard's house."

912
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
 "When the high priest saw this,

913
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,000
 he let these two prisoners go to your house."

914
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 He believed in Jesus Christ.

915
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,600
 He served them food,

916
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,000
 washed their feet,

917
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 and did everything.

918
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,200
 Some people believe

919
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,800
 that death is inevitable,

920
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,000
 and the whole family may be excommunicated.

921
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,400
 But the Bible says in chapter 34,

922
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
 let's read it together.

923
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,800
 "Then the prison guard took them to his house,

924
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,600
 and put them on a table,

925
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,400
 and he and his family were filled with joy."

926
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
 They were filled with joy.

927
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,000
 From a person who was afraid of death,

928
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,200
 who wanted to die,

929
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,400
 who wanted to commit suicide,

930
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,600
 and to change,

931
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,000
 they became filled with joy.

932
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
 Why?

933
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
 Because they had seen the truth.

934
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
 Jesus Christ is the Lord of Resurrection.

935
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,200
 Why should I be afraid?

936
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,600
 Since what I did was right,

937
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,000
 why should I be afraid?

938
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,400
 The two prisoners were still there.

939
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,600
 I can tell them what happened

940
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,800
 as a witness.

941
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,200
 On the other hand,

942
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,000
 how did Paul see his own departure?

943
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,800
 In the book of Timothy, chapter 4, verse 7-8,

944
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,000
 "He took a book and placed it on his son,

945
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 and said to him, 'What is it?'

946
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,400
 'Let us read together.'

947
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
 'I have already fought the battle,

948
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,400
 and I have already gone all the way,

949
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
 and I have already kept the way I believe.'

950
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,200
 'From now on, I will be known as a righteous man.'

951
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,200
 'On the day the Lord of Justice comes,

952
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,600
 He will bestow upon me,

953
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
 not only upon me,

954
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,600
 but also upon all those who love Him.'"

955
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,000
 What does death mean?

956
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Death is the award of a class president.

957
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
 To each of us who follows the Lord today,

958
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,600
 to the whole world,

959
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,000
 death is the award of a class president

960
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,800
 after the sports race.

961
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,200
 Who is the winner?

962
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
 Who is the winner?

963
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,200
 Paul said,

964
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,400
 "If I follow the Lord my whole life,

965
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,400
 I will be in front of God,

966
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,000
 in the Lord's hands,

967
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,400
 and receive the champion's award."

968
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,000
 He will receive the title of the winner.

969
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,200
 After visiting Rome,

970
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,400
 I saw many things

971
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
 that can be seen in the faith.

972
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
 I saw the influence of the faith

973
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,000
 Let me show you.

974
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
 This time,

975
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,400
 when I was not teaching,

976
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
 I had a section every day,

977
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
 for two to three hours.

978
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,800
 Someone took us to Rome.

979
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
 What did we visit?

980
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,600
 Some churches.

981
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
 They prepared for us

982
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,400
 some commemorative信徒.

983
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,800
 The first one was

984
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,800
 the place where Peter the Great was persecuted.

985
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 I went to this place.

986
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
 There were three floors of earthen houses.

987
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,000
 The first floor.

988
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 The second floor.

989
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,600
 The third floor.

990
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,800
 It was very dark.

991
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,400
 The most unforgettable thing in my heart

992
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,800
 was this pillar.

993
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,600
 It was written on this pillar

994
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,000
 that Paul was on this pillar.

995
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,800
 I think he was made out of it.

996
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,000
 It was a completely identical pillar.

997
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 It was where he was beheaded.

998
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 There was a painting

999
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 about Paul's faith.

1000
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 It also mentioned Peter's cross

1001
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 was shown in that place.

1002
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 After that,

1003
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,600
 I saw that there was a document

1004
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,400
 not only in Italian,

1005
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,800
 but also in English,

1006
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,000
 which was written in that place.

1007
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,400
 This church commemorated

1008
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,600
 Paul and Peter's faith.

1009
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,000
 I went to another church

1010
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,600
 to commemorate a Roman Caesar

1011
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:33,000
 named Cleopatra.

1012
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,600
 In the early 4th century,

1013
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:45,000
 she killed 10,203 Roman soldiers.

1014
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,800
 Why did she kill so many soldiers?

1015
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,600
 Because these soldiers

1016
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,800
 did not listen to Caesar

1017
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,600
 when he was killing the Christians.

1018
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
 They would rather I die

1019
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,000
 than kill the Christians.

1020
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,600
 They were innocent.

1021
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,800
 That is why they were killed.

1022
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
 I never thought that

1023
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,200
 after the Great Emperor was killed,

1024
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,800
 the next one to come was Constantine.

1025
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,400
 He changed the whole of Rome

1026
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,400
 to become a Christian country.

1027
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,600
 Why did he do that?

1028
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
 Why did he change?

1029
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,200
 He saw some unchangeable facts.

1030
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
 The number of Christians who died

1031
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,400
 was 100,000.

1032
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,200
 What he believed was the true historical facts.

1033
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,800
 What they believed was the truth.

1034
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,200
 How did Paul go to jail?

1035
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,600
 In Philippians 4, verse 22,

1036
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,200
 he even said this

1037
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
 when he was in jail.

1038
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,400
 Let's read it together.

1039
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
 "The apostles and the saints asked you for your safety.

1040
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,000
 The people of Caesar

1041
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,400
 asked you for your safety."

1042
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,200
 He specifically said

1043
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
 that in this place of Philippi,

1044
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
 the people of Caesar

1045
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,800
 asked you for your safety.

1046
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,400
 We will ask today,

1047
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
 why did the people of Caesar

1048
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
 ask the apostles for their safety?

1049
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,800
 Unless someone in Caesar believed.

1050
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,200
 It turned out that Constantine's faith

1051
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,400
 came from his mother.

1052
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,400
 Where did his mother's faith come from?

1053
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,000
 It must have been passed down to him by the Christians.

1054
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 How did the Christians pass it down?

1055
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,600
 It must have been passed down when he was in jail.

1056
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,600
 I am here to offer this testimony.

1057
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
 We can see

1058
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,400
 that what Paul established

1059
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,600
 was a model of living in the flesh.

1060
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,200
 The model of the Antiochian Church,

1061
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
 the education of the Holy Scripture,

1062
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,000
 was the most important.

1063
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,400
 It was in the Church,

1064
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,800
 by the Church,

1065
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,600
 and for the Church.

1066
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,400
 It was established in the Church,

1067
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,800
 by the Church,

1068
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,800
 and for the Church.

1069
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,400
 In other words,

1070
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,200
 the Holy Scripture education

1071
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,600
 is closely related to the Church.

1072
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,800
 Let's watch a video

1073
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,600
 and prepare our hearts.

1074
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,200
 Many of our brothers and sisters in the Church

1075
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,000
 have received the equipment

1076
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 and returned to the Church to serve.

1077
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,600
 We are grateful to them.

1078
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,200
 I hope we can

1079
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,400
 study the Holy Scripture at any time, any place.

1080
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,400
 "Live to learn, live to use, build a door to the world."

1081
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,800
 "The whole world will be at your feet."

1082
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,200
 "The whole world will be at your feet."

1083
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,600
 I went to Rome

1084
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,800
 to help the Italian Catholic Church

1085
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,400
 that was established by Fr. Giancarlo Lungarum.

1086
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,000
 It was a Christian Catholic Church.

1087
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,400
 I came to help them.

1088
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,000
 On the other hand,

1089
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 we see that the whole world

1090
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 is becoming more and more

1091
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,800
 rich in equipment

1092
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,400
 before the Lord comes.

1093
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
 I hope that the brothers and sisters in the Church

1094
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,000
 can cherish this opportunity

1095
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,800
 to seize the opportunity.

1096
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,400
 Our own Church has the Holy Scripture.

1097
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,200
 We can study more and more

1098
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
 and equip ourselves.

1099
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
 May God bless you.
