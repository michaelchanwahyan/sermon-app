[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300]   When I saw Woody, I thought he was holding a gold medal
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.640]   to thank the people around him
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.740]   But I'm really grateful
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.480]   to hear about the growth of their faith
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.880]   Sister Ding, I don't know what you think
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.620]   after hearing their story
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.280]   This year is very special
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.260]   I think if you share it with them
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.820]   they will know for sure
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.000]   As they said
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.760]   they are not the sisters who serve in the Youth Ministry
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.100]   They go to camp and to the short-term school
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.980]   They have different experiences and different growth
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.020]   But after hearing their stories
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.420]   Sister Ding, I want to ask you
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.980]   Give you five seconds to think
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.620]   After this summer vacation
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.960]   or looking back at your faith a year ago
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.060]   your faith life
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.500]   to this moment
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.060]   is there any difference?
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.600]   Your relationship with God
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.340]   your relationship with the team
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.240]   or even your faith in life
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.500]   Give you five seconds to think
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.620]   Is there any difference?
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.720]   Five seconds should be enough
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.820]   I don't know what you think
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480]   This year's theme is
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.120]   Transform Our Lives Going for Christ
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.660]   I don't know how much of your life
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.560]   you have implemented
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.800]   the theme of this year
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.100]   But I think these two weeks
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.400]   after participating in different activities
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.540]   we have done some reviews
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.680]   to think about how you are doing this summer
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.380]   We also have an experience
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.980]   We think that this summer
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.620]   we feel that many sisters in the Youth Ministry
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.260]   your spirit, your faith
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.560]   and your commitment are back
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.400]   You are willing to do
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.560]   and try
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.000]   Even in the camp
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.060]   you are willing to explore more
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.600]   to ask more about what faith is
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.040]   This year, in the coming new year
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.000]   we will have a new theme
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.740]   In fact, the worship of the church
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.340]   is also the direction of our new theme
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.980]   This year's new direction
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.240]   we want to do one thing
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.980]   to show God's way
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.120]   to walk into the corner of the world
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.420]   The theme of today's sermon is
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.520]   Alive in Christ, Let's Go and Shine
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.060]   This is what we want to do
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.700]   with you in the Youth Ministry in the new year
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.860]   I think in the new year
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.540]   I want to take you one step further
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.700]   to see what we have done
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.540]   In the past two years
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.900]   we have done many different short sermons
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.640]   and many different services
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.280]   to explore faith
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.380]   But this year, I really want to
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.280]   through the sermon of the Church of Christ
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   to broaden your vision of faith
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.120]   I think in the past few years
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.420]   we have often talked to you about
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.720]   life growth, life transformation
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   We need to experience God more
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.520]   We will continue to
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.600]   experience and explore these with you
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.400]   But I think this year
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.060]   I want to take one step further
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.300]   to show that our faith
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.040]   is not just about our own lives
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.540]   but also to broaden your vision of faith
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.040]   It turns out that
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.540]   our faith is not just about ourselves
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.140]   It turns out that our faith has many things
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.320]   that God's perspective can be so broad
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.720]   Today, I want to share with you
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.520]   the 60 chapters of the New Testament
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.560]   the 60 chapters of the New Testament
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.060]   and see how the New Testament
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.360]   will lead us to this year's theme
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.900]   Let's talk about the background of the New Testament
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.400]   There are 66 chapters in the New Testament
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.540]   People usually divide the 66 chapters into three parts
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.740]   The 60 chapters we are going to look at today
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.080]   are in the third part
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.220]   The third part of the New Testament
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.220]   is very special
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.120]   It has a very important theme
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.980]   It only talks about the message of salvation
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   It doesn't talk about the judgment
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.560]   or other messages
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.160]   The 62 chapters
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.960]   are the very core message of the third part
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.700]   It talks about the scene
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   when Jerusalem was rebuilt
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.500]   and glorified
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.900]   and even the rebuilding of the temple
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.780]   When we look at the 60 chapters today
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.120]   there are similarities with the 59 chapters
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.280]   because there are many similar words
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   such as glory, salvation, justice, light
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.220]   The 59 chapters are about
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.900]   the world without salvation or justice
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.300]   Only God can bring these things out
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.460]   It also talks about the coming of the Messiah
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.140]   and the people's being a symbol of justice
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.900]   and other themes
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.740]   Today, we are going to look at only three chapters
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.860]   These three chapters are the main theme
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.960]   of the whole 60 chapters
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.160]   Let's read the three chapters together
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.000]   Let's read the 60 chapters of the New Testament
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.700]   Chapter 1-3
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.300]   Ready?
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.500]   "Behold, the light is coming,
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.900]   and the glory of the Lord is coming to you.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.640]   See, the darkness covers the earth,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.600]   and the darkness covers the people.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.680]   The Lord is coming, and the glory of the Lord is coming to you.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.880]   The glory of the Lord is coming to you.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.580]   The glory of the Lord is coming to you."
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.860]   You may be familiar with this song
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.020]   because you often sing this song
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.260]   Before we enter the scripture
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.460]   let's pray together
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.660]   Lord, lead us
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.400]   Let us be filled with your heart
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.260]   Let us let your words
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.800]   come to our lives
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.200]   Lord, lead us with your light
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.400]   Lead us in the new year
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.340]   Let us learn how to live in faith
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.840]   and how to live in life
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.580]   Lord, lead us
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.540]   Thank you, Lord, for your help
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.940]   Lord, bless us
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.620]   We have just read the three chapters
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.720]   In the three chapters
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.820]   we may ask a question
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.960]   What are you referring to?
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.360]   In the third part of Isaiah
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.160]   we see that the "you"
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.700]   is referring to the rock
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.940]   and to Jerusalem
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.940]   This is a call to the rock
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.040]   The rock is to shine
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.280]   and to bring forth
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.640]   the reason why it should do so
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.880]   The light has come
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   The glory of the Lord is coming to you
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.860]   We may ask, what is the light?
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.760]   The light is not coming from the rock
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.400]   but from God
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.660]   So the announcement is about
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.860]   God coming to the rock
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.040]   Then the next sentence is
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.980]   "The glory of the Lord is coming to you"
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.880]   We may ask, what is the meaning
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.620]   of "is coming to you"?
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.820]   The word "discover"
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.320]   is a meaning of rising
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.120]   This word is constantly used
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.220]   in the three chapters
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.060]   because the word "discover"
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.660]   is the same as "rise"
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.960]   It is like a scene
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.340]   when the sun rises
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.040]   and shines on the earth
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.880]   It is a similar scene
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.940]   Likewise, when we read this word
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.840]   we may focus on the word "glory"
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.380]   "Brother, I don't know what glory is"
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.480]   We often talk about glory
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.480]   I don't know if you know what it is
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.880]   The word "glory"
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.220]   has a special meaning in Hebrew
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.220]   It refers to something that is important
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.760]   and real
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.600]   It usually refers to the glory of God
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.800]   or even the glory of God
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.700]   But this word, especially here
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.200]   is about God's appearance
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   God's presence
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.080]   and even God's authority over His people
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.480]   So we see that this sentence
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.720]   is a message that is balanced
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.180]   God's presence is with Zion
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.620]   God wants to shine on Zion
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.520]   This announcement may seem far away
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.000]   to us who are reading this
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.700]   But it is very meaningful
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.900]   to the readers of the time
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.900]   Why?
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.600]   Because for the entire people of Israel
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   when we look back at their entire experience
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.240]   what was the time when
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.080]   Jehovah's Witnesses and their glory
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.880]   were together?
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.080]   It was when they left Egypt
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.480]   and stayed in Mount Sinai
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.620]   Later, when their people developed
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.960]   when the king of Solomon went to build the temple
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.820]   at the time of the offering
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.160]   Jehovah's Witnesses were among them
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.060]   But when their people
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.000]   started to leave God
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.240]   different Bible records
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.040]   have Jehovah's Witnesses
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.040]   leaving Jerusalem
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   Later, they went through the kingdom of the king
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.000]   and the city of Beelzebub
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.640]   and the city of Zeon
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.080]   and became a group of tyrants
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.680]   So when we talk about Jehovah's Witnesses
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.080]   and their glory
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.780]   what is important is that
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.620]   the entire people
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.920]   experienced a transformation
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.420]   and were resurrected
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.320]   What we see is that
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.160]   the people of Israel
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.560]   were connected to the nobles on earth
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.960]   and wanted to glorify themselves
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.800]   But the people were gone
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.600]   But Jehovah said
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.140]   that he wanted to come to Zeon
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.540]   to resurrect them
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.980]   I think for the readers of the time
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.320]   what they saw was
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.780]   that they were able to experience salvation
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.820]   and the king of the tribes
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.220]   was able to realize
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.420]   the promise Jehovah made to them
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.620]   I think what Jehovah is saying here
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.020]   is that the glory and light of Jehovah
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.800]   should be glorified in Zeon
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.160]   and be resurrected in the darkness of Zeon
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.200]   I think what Jehovah is saying here
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.240]   is that the people of Israel
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.000]   and the entire people
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.100]   were revived and experienced a transformation
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.900]   I think the book of Exodus is very special
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.440]   In addition to talking about the situation at the time
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.540]   it also represents the events of the New Testament
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.240]   We often hear about the New Testament
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.480]   I think that when the New Testament is written
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.580]   people can be able to shine a light on life
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.220]   through the light of Jesus Christ
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.820]   and also let people experience life's changes
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.960]   Similarly, after 2,000 years
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.520]   we are still here
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.000]   I think we are experiencing the same things
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.300]   The glory of God, the presence of God
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.940]   the light of God shining on our lives
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.640]   are all shared by people during the summer
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.980]   However, brothers and sisters
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.540]   when we look back at the summer
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.140]   we have watched the videos
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.920]   we have a lot of experiences
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.820]   in the short stories and the camp
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.780]   We have a lot of letters
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.180]   In the camp of the Great Zion
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.420]   we have a lot of different letters
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.360]   In the camp of the early days
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.900]   we made a sheep
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.500]   to shine a light on the world
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   There are a lot of different letters
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.300]   In the camp of the high school
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.600]   that house was destroyed
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.100]   There are a lot of different letters
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.040]   I think we have a lot of letters
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.880]   that are very special
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.780]   In the three camps this year
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.720]   there are a lot of letters
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.780]   with a lot of lights
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.460]   and different themes
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.120]   We say that we want to experience life's changes
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.060]   We want to experience the resurrection of the Holy Spirit
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.420]   We want to shine a light on the world
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.620]   But sometimes I think
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.400]   we experience these things every summer
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.900]   We have to shine a light for God
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.600]   We say this every year
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.200]   I want to ask you
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.980]   Is what you wrote in your letter
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.780]   the same as last year?
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.180]   Some people may think
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.940]   I write the same letter every year
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.180]   I said I would go to church this year
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.520]   but I didn't
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.520]   What is it?
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.360]   It seems to be a slogan
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.520]   Or maybe in our faith
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.160]   there is a situation
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.860]   I named it
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.660]   This situation
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.200]   or we all have a fantasy
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.840]   about a summer vacation
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.700]   What is it?
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.380]   Let Dr. Fung explain
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.240]   This is the situation
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.740]   When we experience the summer vacation
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.640]   we feel like we are back
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.020]   We experience the presence of God
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.180]   and the changes of life
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.620]   We are grateful to God
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.180]   Next week we start school
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.420]   We start school
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.520]   I want to write in this letter
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.020]   I must be able to do this
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.960]   Then in November
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.740]   we enter stage 1
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.900]   We are very busy
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.860]   I study UT, midterm
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.640]   My life is very energetic
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.740]   I am exhausted
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.880]   I am very tired
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.040]   In December and January
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.540]   I start exams
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.080]   I have a lot to do
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.180]   I have to serve
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.920]   I can't do this
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.020]   I am a little burnt out
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.920]   I need to take a break
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.020]   We enter stage 2
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.860]   Stage 3
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.820]   January to June
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.920]   At this time
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.660]   my life is full of things to do
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.760]   The challenge of my faith is getting bigger
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.100]   I have a youth leader
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.300]   I have a lot to do
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.400]   It is like the summer vacation
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.360]   has been washed away by the current
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.780]   I think that for people with post-traumatic stress disorder
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.340]   they usually have a situation
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.820]   that before the summer vacation ends
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.180]   they will write
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.280]   As the care leader said last week
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.960]   we want to write a walking bible
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.760]   When we walk out
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.660]   we tell people what our faith is
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.260]   But in the end
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.700]   we become a walking dead
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.400]   But it is a very funny thing
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.600]   Or
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.360]   we are grateful to God's leadership
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.800]   When we come back next summer
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.000]   our walking dead will suddenly
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.640]   change us into a human
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.140]   and make us a walking bible in our faith
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.580]   Brothers and sisters
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.080]   I would like to ask you
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.060]   In the past few years
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.460]   have we been in this cycle?
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.200]   Brothers and sisters
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.700]   I think our faith life is really endless
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.400]   In the new year
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.000]   I would like to learn something from you
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.640]   We have to be alive in Christ
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.600]   Or we have to see
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.580]   what we experience in the summer vacation
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.620]   When we are going to do it
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.820]   we have to have a mindset
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.320]   that what we experience
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.780]   what we learn to do
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.980]   those abilities come from God
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.120]   When we learn to do something
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.220]   we have to remember that
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.000]   God gives us the ability to do what we want
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.360]   God controls our life
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.060]   so that we can know how to live out
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.340]   what we write
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.880]   As the Bible says
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.740]   the reason why John was able to shine
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.940]   was not because of himself
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.840]   but because of the presence of Jesus
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.980]   and the power of God
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.980]   Likewise, our life has to be illuminated
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.520]   At least we have to learn one thing
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.660]   Our life has to be able to keep alive in Christ
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.960]   We have to let this light
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.200]   keep shining in our lives
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.800]   You know, I think this light
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.700]   is not a flash light
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.940]   Wow
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.000]   I think this light
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.480]   is not a flash light in the summer vacation
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.380]   This light is a long-lasting spotlight
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.520]   to shine on our lives
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.880]   Brothers and sisters
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.980]   Let's learn together
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.460]   What we learn is
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.120]   we learn to be alive in Christ
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.160]   We don't become a walking dead
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.940]   in November
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.860]   What we see is
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.740]   the light of our lives
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.260]   comes from God
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.800]   I think this light
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.700]   is a constant light that shines on our lives
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.500]   Its glory and presence
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.600]   are always with our lives
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.780]   Likewise, our lives
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.780]   are under God's control
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.280]   So, are we willing to continue
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.240]   learning and doing this?
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.580]   This is the first part
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.980]   I want to share with you this year
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.120]   The second part
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.560]   I think this light
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.320]   is not just a flash light
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.120]   When we look at the Bible
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.000]   when John said to rise up
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.160]   to restore the rock
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.460]   it is not just a moment
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.800]   When we look at the Bible
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.400]   we see the first verse
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.240]   has two verbs
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.640]   "to rise up and shine"
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.540]   This is a commandment
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.920]   It means that the rock
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.340]   and the whole nation
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.320]   have a mission to respond
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.760]   "to rise up and shine"
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.020]   In English, it is "arise and shine"
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.260]   This word has a similar meaning
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.800]   It is like a mother
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.600]   calling a sleeping baby
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.060]   Likewise, John says
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.200]   to awaken a sleeping rock
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.600]   "You have to rise up and respond"
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.440]   What is the response?
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   When we look at the second verse
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.320]   there is a link
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   In the second verse
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.980]   the word "to rise up" is not there
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.620]   but in the original text
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.680]   there is a word "because"
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.260]   It means that John said
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260]   to shine the rock
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260]   there is a reason
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260]   When we look at the third verse
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.800]   we see a very important contrast
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.200]   It is a big theme
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.600]   Light and darkness
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.740]   John said that the earth is dark
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.680]   and the people are covered by darkness
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.440]   This scene is like
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.020]   the blindfold game
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.720]   where you can't see anything
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.620]   The word "darkness"
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.520]   also means "death"
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.220]   in the Bible
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.160]   "No signs"
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   "A dead end"
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   This is the scene
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.820]   that we are trying to imagine
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.400]   Everything is dark
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.040]   except for a place called Zion
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.100]   where there is a sudden glow
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.800]   The surrounding area is dark
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.500]   and the people are not blind
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.380]   They are even covered by darkness
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.340]   When we look at this scene
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.880]   if you are familiar with the Bible
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.280]   you might think of a scene
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.480]   When the Egyptians went to Egypt
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.560]   to experience the flood
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.420]   the land was dark
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.660]   Only the houses of the Egyptians
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.200]   had light
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.160]   It is a similar scene
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.000]   But I think Isaiah
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.500]   did not just want to express the situation
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.140]   In the second verse
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.880]   the word "to rise up" is there
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.760]   The word is used to
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.880]   wake up the people of Zion
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   and the readers of the Bible
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.120]   What is it saying?
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.560]   "Were you not in the darkness before?"
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   "Now the Lord is calling you"
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.200]   "to appear before you"
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.800]   "Since you have come out of the darkness"
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.100]   "do not poison the light"
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.580]   "You must let the light shine"
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.780]   "so that the people of darkness will know"
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.480]   "the light of Zion is a thing"
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.880]   In the third verse
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.580]   when the light is brought out
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.680]   what impact will it have?
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.380]   The Bible says
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.260]   "The kingdom of man will come to save you"
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.820]   "The Lord will come to save you"
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.160]   What we see is
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.200]   the most important goal
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.900]   is to let the people of darkness
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.440]   know the beauty of light
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.700]   We know that Zion
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.580]   is a mission
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.880]   Likewise
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.080]   we see in the third verse
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   "Your light and your revelation"
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.480]   the word "to rise up" appears again
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.580]   I want to say something
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.480]   in response to Zion's glory
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.980]   and its light
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.760]   to attract the people of darkness
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.100]   to Zion
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.860]   Zion has a mission
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.400]   to do this
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.620]   This is also a key point
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.220]   for Zion to witness God
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.460]   Zion has to bring out its light
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.000]   The light is not about how bright it is
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.500]   or how beautiful the city is
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.100]   The light is for the people of darkness
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.520]   to let the people of darkness know the light
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.920]   and let them know
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.280]   the origin of the light
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.180]   and what kind of God Jehovah is
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.820]   and to share his glory
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.120]   Zion is like a lighthouse
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.860]   It is the focus of the nation
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.120]   to let the nation know
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.100]   what the light is
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.760]   and to come to worship God
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.360]   and to offer up
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.860]   This is also what the book of Exodus says
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.400]   in chapter 60, verse 3
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.000]   It says a lot
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.840]   The people of darkness must return
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.540]   and offer up
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.540]   The people must be reconciled
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.040]   and see the hope
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.200]   This is what we sing in Exodus 60
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.680]   The lyrics
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.280]   are about this scene
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.440]   It is very special
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.120]   Exodus does not describe it clearly
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.920]   what kind of light Zion was under
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   It only says
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.520]   regardless of the light
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.260]   Zion must shine
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.420]   and let people see hope
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.800]   Brothers and sisters
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.360]   For us
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.600]   for those who are new to the world
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.160]   and even for those who are here and now
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.500]   this is our mission
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.440]   Just like Jesus gave us the great mission
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.080]   to shine the light on our door
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.240]   I mean, the door of the Lord
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.480]   Brothers and sisters
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.420]   The focus of the light
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.380]   never says
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.020]   what kind of light we need to have in our life
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.140]   We never need to fulfill
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.720]   any criteria to shine the light
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.980]   We shine the light
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.420]   because we are willing to show
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.120]   the beauty of the light in our life
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.960]   Just like what Gaga said
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.860]   What God is good?
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.360]   I forgot what she said
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.160]   To let people see
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.700]   how great God is
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.200]   The Lord said to restore Zion
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.300]   and to shine the light for the Lord
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.640]   The light is not just about the light
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.140]   but to let more people around us
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.480]   worship and know the Lord
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.920]   I think this mission is very consistent
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.820]   When we look at the New Testament
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.020]   the disciples in the process of the church
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.820]   also shined the light
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.300]   to let more foreigners
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.060]   and more Jews
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.660]   become Christians and worship the Lord
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.440]   Let me say more
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.340]   Ah
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.540]   Back to Hong Kong
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.040]   I don't know if you've seen
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.540]   the history of Hong Kong
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.580]   In the past, Hong Kong was a center for the mission of the Church
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.740]   There were many different pastors
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.580]   such as Mary Sun
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.780]   They brought the light to Hong Kong
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.700]   and let many different churches
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.300]   come closer to the top
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.020]   During the summer vacation this year
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.800]   you went to Tuen Xuan
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.100]   In the process, we met Elman
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.960]   Sarah Wilson
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.240]   and Jackie
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.740]   I think that whether in Campbell
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.480]   Taiwan or Hong Kong
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.540]   they are using their lives to shine the light
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.180]   to let people see what it is to be a pastor
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:48.080]   I think that these are all true
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.280]   I think that these are all true
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.360]   For us, we see that
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.920]   God uses people from different places
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.060]   to let people see the beauty of the light
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.560]   Sisters
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.760]   In the past, we talked a lot about
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.900]   the growth of our lives
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.840]   We will continue to do so
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.180]   But this year
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.000]   I want to take another step forward
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.980]   to show everyone
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.480]   that faith has a universal nature
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.980]   Faith is not just about
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.980]   the relationship between ourselves and God
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.780]   Faith is not just about
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.920]   the relationship between ourselves and the group
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.660]   Faith is not just about
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.160]   the relationship between ourselves and the group
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.660]   Faith is not just about
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.260]   the relationship between ourselves and the group
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.700]   I think that in Hong Kong
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.640]   and in other places around the world
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.400]   there are many people
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.240]   who are doing the same thing
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.980]   Sisters
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.600]   Are we willing to
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.420]   step out of our comfort zone
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.520]   to do the "Let's go and shine" thing
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.620]   to let us show off
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.380]   in different places
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.320]   how bright we are
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.960]   and to let people see
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.360]   how beautiful the light
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.320]   and God in our lives are
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.300]   Sisters
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.700]   This year's theme is
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.200]   "Alive in Christ, Let's go and shine"
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.740]   I think that we, as colleagues
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.340]   would like to learn this thing together
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.500]   I'm not saying that
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.080]   when we can do "Alive in Christ"
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.740]   our lives will not be challenged
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.680]   and our lives will not be exhausted
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.420]   We will experience those things
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.980]   I'm not saying that
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.180]   as a missionary
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.180]   I can be alive 365 days a year
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.820]   There will be times when I feel exhausted
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.660]   But I think that
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.420]   when we are in a momentary situation
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.960]   our life
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   is there a choice
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.660]   to continue to seek God?
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.260]   Just like what Gaga said
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.140]   "The wisdom of the soul"
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.740]   Is there a wisdom
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.540]   in our lives
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.800]   that we can continue to walk like this?
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.000]   Sisters, I think that
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.300]   this is something that we, as colleagues
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.180]   would like to continue to learn together
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.440]   "Alive in Christ, Let's go and shine"
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.340]   is the call of Isaiah
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.580]   When Zion was saved by God
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.380]   he had a mission
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.460]   to let the light out
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.620]   so that the people in darkness
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.820]   could see the light and respond to the light
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.060]   The Apostles of the Lord
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.560]   and the Apostles of the Lord
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.160]   are actually moving stones
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.440]   to show the light in their lives
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.340]   and to let people see it
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.040]   Sisters, today
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.340]   this plate may have been passed down to us
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.900]   Don't think that when you are young
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.440]   you think, "No, I still have to take the DSC"
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.580]   "Don't, don't care about me"
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.240]   "Please forgive him, don't forgive me"
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.580]   But sisters
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.120]   the mission is the core of our faith
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.260]   Let us learn to respond together
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.420]   First, learn the first thing
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.460]   "Alive in Christ"
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.000]   When we experience the transformation of the life of the cross
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.200]   don't go to the walking dead in November
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.240]   What we see is that
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   the light of our life comes from the Lord
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.200]   The Lord continues to shine in our lives
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.280]   to walk out of the words we have written in the cross
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.380]   We have to learn to continue
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.120]   like what we said last week
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.480]   we have to do a walking bible
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.880]   Similarly, when our lives are kept alive
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.620]   we should not only be a witness to the light
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.420]   but also learn to "Let's go and shine"
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.460]   This is a mission that God gave us more than 2,000 years ago
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.060]   to let the light shine
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.500]   to let people see the beauty of the light
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.800]   Indeed, we are also like this
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.980]   Some of the elders in the church
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.100]   when we go to different places
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.980]   we can let people around us see the beauty of the light
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:52.080]   But, sisters, are we willing to see
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.580]   that this is what God has given us
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.220]   Are we willing to let this become
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.860]   what we have been dreaming of and what we have been doing?
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.460]   Sisters, I would like to invite you to stand up
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.760]   Let's sing a song of repentance
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:14.180]   Sisters, I don't know
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.580]   when you go home today
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.080]   and see the words you have written in the cross
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.960]   I don't know if you have ever thought about it
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.260]   What you should think about is
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:31.160]   how you want to implement it in your life
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.460]   If you haven't thought about it
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.500]   you might be writing the same thing
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.700]   when you make a better cross next year
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.340]   But let us continue to learn
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.140]   to keep our lives alive in Christ
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.140]   so that we can take another step
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.080]   Let's go and try
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.080]   Let's sing a song of repentance
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.720]   There is still darkness covering the earth
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   There is still darkness covering the people
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.740]   There is still a way to wait for you
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:15.740]   There is still darkness covering the earth
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   There is still darkness covering the people
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.680]   There is still a way to wait for you
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.480]   There is still a way to wait for you
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.260]   There is still darkness covering the earth
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.460]   Let us announce together
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.460]   Your repentance is enough
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.200]   Your repentance is enough
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   Your repentance is enough
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.480]   Your repentance is enough
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.220]   Your repentance is enough
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   Your repentance is enough
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   You always appear to guide me
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:18.540]   The light of the sun never fades away
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:25.540]   Like my feet, they are full of your wisdom, forever
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:33.060]   May the world see the record of your love
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.660]   Your repentance is enough
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.360]   Your repentance is enough
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:46.360]   Your repentance is enough
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:51.000]   Your repentance is enough
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.580]   Your repentance is enough
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:00.580]   Your repentance is enough
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   Your repentance is enough
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   Your repentance is enough
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.700]   Your repentance is enough
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:25.700]   Your repentance is enough
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:30.700]   Your repentance is enough
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.700]   You always appear to guide me
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:44.720]   The light of the sun never fades away
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   Like my feet, they are full of your wisdom, forever
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   May the world see the record of your love
