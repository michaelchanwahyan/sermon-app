[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   I want to ask you a question.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.000]   What gets you up in the morning?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.720]   When a job interviewer asks you that question, what gets you up in the morning?
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.120]   You might be thinking to yourself, coffee.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.800]   But that, according to experts, is the wrong answer.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.060]   Interviewers who ask this question are looking to see what fuels your everyday life.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.560]   We all have something that motivates us.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:55.560]   And they are looking for you to help them understand what it is for you exactly.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.480]   Researchers tell us the five best answers are, "What gets me up in the morning is the
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.680]   opportunity to learn something new."
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.600]   Or "What gets me up in the morning is the ability to make mistakes."
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.320]   Or "What gets me up in the morning is the ability to work with a team."
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.440]   What gets me up in the morning is the opportunity to compete.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.920]   I love friendly competition.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.240]   And lastly, what gets me up in the morning is the notion that every day is a brand new
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.960]   day to grow.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.320]   Now if you're about to go for a job interview, take your phone out, do a screenshot.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.600]   These are the right answers.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:59.800]   But what gets me up in the morning is to be part of building the kingdom of God.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.880]   Now that might sound a little bit weird or specific, but that one statement contains
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:18.400]   all the things that are dear to me, specifically the unity of God's church.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.920]   I've been in this role here at KFCI for almost six years now.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.720]   It's gone quickly, eh?
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:37.000]   And when people ask me why I took this position, my answer is simple, bridge building.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.960]   In my 35 years in Hong Kong, I have witnessed so much division in the body of Christ.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   Denomination against denomination.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.720]   Edges between Protestants and Catholics.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.600]   Charismatics and evangelicals.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.440]   International and local churches.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:14.040]   Christians are wasting more energy fighting each other than fighting the real enemy.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.760]   I've seen church splits and some people who seem to change church more often than they
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.040]   change their toothpaste.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.360]   And to be honest, you can hear it in my tone of voice.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.400]   It makes me sick.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.960]   Which is why I prefer to build bridges and tear down walls rather than the other way
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.520]   round.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:53.880]   I just wish people would see through the lens of the kingdom.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.160]   There is one kingdom and there is one King.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.640]   My job, my calling, my passion is kingdom building.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.560]   Now you might say, surely, isn't it as a pastor to build the church?
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.280]   And you'd have a point.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.680]   The church was precious to Jesus and it's precious to me.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:32.440]   The church is precious to me and that's why we're having this series.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.400]   But in that, I am guided by the words of Jesus.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.360]   Matthew 6, 33, I'll put it on the screen, you know it.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.920]   added to you.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.800]   This is slap bang in the middle of the sermon of the mount as Jesus encourages His followers
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.760]   not to worry about the things of this world.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.200]   Verse 31, asks some important questions.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.720]   So do not worry saying, what should we eat?
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.160]   I bet some of you are thinking already, what am I going to eat for dinner tonight?
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   I know.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.960]   What should we eat?
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   What should we drink?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.080]   What should we wear?
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:34.200]   What Jesus was saying is do not equate your life to the level of the Hang Seng Index or
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.320]   the latest pair of sneakers, Johnny.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.400]   Or the good looking guy or girl you've got your eyes on.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.000]   We are to be kingdom seekers.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.680]   That means submitting to the King, doing the will of the King and making Christ the King
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.200]   your first priority.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.880]   But look at this.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.880]   Jesus told Peter after Peter had declared that Jesus was the Messiah in Matthew 16.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:21.200]   Jesus said this, "I will build my church."
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.760]   I will build my church.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:31.360]   We've spent six weeks together on church together, looking at the early church and what it means
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.840]   to be a church together.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:45.320]   We've looked at being steeped in the word of God, in prayer, in hospitality and community.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.920]   And we have demonstrated them too.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.280]   Who could forget James's amazing recital of the book of Philippians?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   The yummy dinner.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.240]   And Johnny going around not with a glass of sake, but the whole bottle, you know.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.720]   The moving group prayer that we had that week.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:17.100]   And the need for a Paul, a Timothy and a Barnabas.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:26.840]   We found the church that Jesus built still to be alive and ready to move forward in these
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.860]   challenging times.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.440]   Let's face it, they are.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.240]   Soon after Jesus died and rose from the dead, He did exactly that.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.760]   He built His church and He has been building it since.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:52.040]   And yet the danger of so many of us, and dare I say, especially us pastors, is for us to
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.880]   fall into the trap of believing it's our church.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880]   I know this.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.680]   Look, when I ask people, I say, "What church do you attend?"
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.400]   They sometimes answer, "Oh, so-and-so's church."
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.040]   So-and-so being the name of the pastor.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:15.000]   And I say, "So-and-so doesn't have a church."
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.040]   And we've been looking these past six weeks at what it means to be Christ's church.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.880]   The one He birthed on the day of Pentecost.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:34.360]   And what I need to do tonight is really look at these five words closely.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.480]   I will build my church.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.840]   In fact, just to wake you up, let's say it all together, shall we?
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   One, two, three.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.120]   I will build my church.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   Ten out of ten.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   Well done.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.720]   Now, the first word, "I."
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.920]   Maybe you could miss it.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.060]   It marks Christ's lordship.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.160]   The first word in this statement is "I."
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.840]   This marks the unique position of Christ as Lord.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.280]   Nobody else is in a position to say what follows this "I."
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:23.320]   Jesus is the only rightful founder and head of the church.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:32.600]   Not you or me or someone else, no matter how eminent they are.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:40.120]   It's the same "I" as in "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.880]   Who else can say that?
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.720]   The second word, "will."
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.600]   It marks Christ's authority.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.440]   When Jesus says, "will," He expresses His authority.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.140]   He says this in Matthew 28, 18.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.120]   It's at the end of the Great Commission, isn't it?
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:07.600]   That Jesus came to them and said, "All authority on heaven and on earth has been given to me."
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.760]   His will is supreme, except for the will of His Father.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.160]   Again, I'm speaking somewhat harshly, yet I hope appropriately.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:30.760]   It's surprising how many believers in Christ proceed according to what pleases them.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:37.880]   We're building a consumer culture into the church without bothering to ask if it pleases
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.360]   Christ and seeking their master's authority.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.880]   Whatever is not according to His will is contrary to it.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.660]   The third word, "build," marks Christ's work.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.840]   When Jesus says, "build," He expresses His work.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.720]   In the book of John, He says this, "My food is to do the will of the one who sent me to
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   finish His work."
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   He then goes on to say, "My Father is at work until now, so I am at work."
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:26.160]   My friends, promoting a dogma, a doctrine, a denomination is not the work of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:36.140]   Only in helping to build the church Christ died for are we doing Christ's work.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:42.240]   The fourth word, "my," indicates Christ's possession.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.640]   The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.960]   I want to read it to you from Corinthians.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:56.680]   No man can lay a foundation other than the one who has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.640]   The church is His bride whom He loves.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   She belongs to no other.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:12.920]   Ephesians 5, we have this at weddings sometimes, "Christ loved the church and gave Himself
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.200]   up for her."
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:22.520]   And lastly, number five, "church," marks Christ's call.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:29.040]   When Jesus says, "church," He expresses His call to the world.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.780]   Jesus calls everyone to His one true church.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:38.840]   The called out people, the Bible calls them the Ekklesia.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   2 Timothy 1 says, "God has saved us and called us with a holy calling."
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:52.240]   That's the only way that we are being made into a true church.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.880]   KFCI.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:03.080]   In every word of that statement, I will build my church.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:11.840]   We are brought to the realisation that Christ's church is what we should be restoring and
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.920]   establishing in the world.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:22.000]   It is Christ's church that we have been discussing for six weeks, and it is Christ's church that
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.960]   is to be prayer-centred, Word-rooted, hospitality-driven, and community-based.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.240]   Because when these things are present, there is a result.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.380]   And what a result it is.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:44.640]   The result is we grow.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:51.680]   We read, didn't we hear, verse 44, "The church was unified, the church was magnified, and
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.120]   then the church multiplied."
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:03.400]   It had a powerful testimony amongst the unsaved Jews, not only because of the miracles done
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.960]   by the apostles, which are in verse 43, but also by the way the members of the fellowship
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.560]   loved each other and served the Lord.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.880]   I tell you ladies, if I'd walked into the YMCA this morning when you were having sisterhood
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.480]   and I was a lady from outside the church and I could see the way that you were relating
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.360]   to each other and loved each other, as a lady I would say, "What's going on?"
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.480]   I want part of that.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.600]   If you were taking your dog for a walk down Repulse Bay Beach this morning and you happened
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.080]   to witness the baptism, you'd say, "What's going on?"
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:51.120]   But really the love that we show for each other is the most important thing.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.960]   That's why we've been talking about community.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   That's why we've been talking about hospitality.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:03.200]   That's why Agnes came and gave us that testimony about inviting friends around her table.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:13.520]   The risen Lord continued to work with them and people continued to be saved.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   I mean, what a church.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.080]   The Christians you meet in the book of Acts were not content to meet once a week for services
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.200]   as usual.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.040]   They met daily, they cared daily, they won souls daily, they searched the scriptures
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.760]   daily and increased in number daily.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.720]   And it was not a five minute wonder.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.020]   It was not the flavour of the month.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:49.160]   Even if we dive forward into Paul's missionary journeys before he received what we call his
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.480]   Macedonian call to go to Europe.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.720]   We read this in Acts 16, 5.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:05.080]   So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:12.160]   Their Christian faith was a day to day reality, not a once a week routine.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.400]   Why?
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.920]   Because the risen Christ was a living reality to them and his resurrection power was at
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.320]   work in their lives through his spirit.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.120]   Let me explore this a little bit more as I finish Acts 2.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:37.600]   A chapter, if you remember when we started off, when the day of Pentecost came, they
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.400]   were all together in one place.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.240]   Do you remember that?
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.160]   The final verses say this.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:52.000]   Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles, praising
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.040]   God and enjoying the favour of all the people.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:04.000]   And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.480]   I want to highlight three outcomes in these verses.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.920]   First is we read everyone was filled with awe.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:21.880]   I was actually going to use the word fear because the word for awe in verse 33 is a
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   Greek word, it's phobos, which can mean fear, terror or reverence.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.960]   We get our English word phobia from it.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.680]   But fear definitely has a double meaning.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.360]   I think so much of Hong Kong at the moment is gripped in fear.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.600]   For example, we are encouraged to fear God.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.080]   Fearing the Lord means to be in reverent awe of his holiness, to give him complete reverence
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:18:01.960]   and to honour him as the God of great glory, majesty and purity.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:13.240]   Now note this, the early church took seriously the command to lay hands on the sick.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:20.400]   And we read that they saw many signs and wonders.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:28.560]   The modern church would do well to do the same, remembering that we don't heal anyone.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   I've never healed anyone.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:39.540]   We pray God heals if he chooses to.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:44.800]   If we pray for 99 people and nobody gets healed, what do we do?
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.480]   We pray for number 100.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:59.800]   But the reality is the more we pray, the more miracles and healings we see.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:06.560]   And that was certainly the case for the axe church, which is why Luke said everyone was
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:15.240]   filled with awe, which leads to my second F, which is favour.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:23.840]   Verse 47 said that they enjoy favour, which actually is the same word as the word used
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.360]   for grace.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.640]   People were amazed and favourable towards them.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:40.880]   This should be the result of our witness, that people praise God and have favour towards
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.760]   the church.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:53.480]   I remember leading a mission team in Bacolod in the Philippines in the 90s with ICM.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:59.240]   We came to the house of a middle-aged man called Ignacio.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.760]   Sandra remember this very well.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.160]   She was blind due to a terrible motorcycle accident.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.960]   The motorcycle exploded and it had burnt most of his skin.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.600]   I wouldn't show you a picture because it was horrible.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:27.100]   Our team prayed for him and by the grace of God, his eyesight was partially restored.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:32.480]   He started to see things that he hadn't seen since his tragic accident.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.200]   And after that, his eyesight continued to improve and he now lives and ministers in
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.320]   a mountain area in a colder climate.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:54.840]   The thing was, it wasn't even me that prayed, but two or three members of our youth group.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:04.520]   But the result mirrored Acts 2 and left everyone praising God and adding so much favour to
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:10.880]   ICM and their wonderful work in the slums in the Philippines.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.080]   This brings out an important lesson.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:25.600]   We are not to seek man's praises, but always point to the almighty God.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:35.300]   But as we do so, the church should be looked upon with favour.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:41.680]   But the best result of all and the best F of all is faith.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:50.480]   Every day, more and more people were coming to faith in Christ and joining the church
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.880]   family.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:59.040]   The result of this church family studying the scriptures together, doing life together,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   sharing meals and communion together, praying together.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:10.860]   Is there something so unique, distinct and wonderful about them that others can't help
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.500]   come to faith in Christ?
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.720]   We heard this in the testimonies this morning at the baptisms.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:23.360]   They could not help come to faith in Christ because of what they saw.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.340]   Now it's not that they don't evangelise and witness.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.940]   They do.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.680]   But how they live positively influences their witness.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.880]   I listened to one pastor this week.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.240]   His name is Skip Heidzik, believe it or not.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.120]   He said, "Our withness aids our witness."
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.720]   I'll say it again.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:55.960]   Our withness aids our witness.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.160]   My earnest prayer for KFCI is this.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:09.460]   That we would become, that we would be known as a kingdom church.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:15.560]   And in that connection, I want to just share some of the things which are on our heart,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.860]   which will be happening in the next few months.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:22.700]   I hope you'll get excited about this.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.080]   The first thing is family, church is family.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.320]   And I'm pleased to announce that from September, we're going to have a family gathering every
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:39.480]   day hosted by James and Christine and the family, Joe and Alex and others.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.080]   Because it's very difficult on a Saturday afternoon.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.120]   Have you noticed we don't have kids here, right?
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:52.160]   So what we're going to be doing in September is we're going to be starting a family expression.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.540]   We don't know where that's going to go.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.940]   We hope it may become eventually a service or something like that.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.600]   But at the moment, it's a pop-up shop, right?
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.520]   We're going to start in September hosting a family gathering on Sundays for people with
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.400]   family, because families are important.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.560]   When we started this church, it was nearly all young people, but the young people are
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.160]   getting older, they're getting married and they're having families and we're changing,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160]   right?
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   And it's good.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.360]   We want to be able to cope with the emerging market that's within us.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.620]   So I am, I tell you what, I am so excited about this.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.620]   You would not believe it.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:36.760]   I know I get excited about a lot, but I'm so excited about this.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:42.080]   If you'd like to know a lot more, go and speak to Bonnie or contact James and Christine,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.100]   go to the welcome counter.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.520]   But we are going to be doing this as a church and it's part of who we are.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.720]   You say, "Oh, what happens about James preaching on a Saturday?"
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.360]   Well, James is going to be preaching at least every six weeks on a Saturday as well.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.840]   So we're not going to be losing James, okay?
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.320]   He's going to be doing this as well.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.580]   I don't know how he fits it all in 24 hours, but that's another thing.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.640]   The next thing is this is going to really excite you.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:12.240]   It's what I call 5G, raising up the next generation of preachers.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.440]   You know, I'm getting old, right?
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.280]   And I'm not going to be here forever, but actually we've got people in this congregation
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.120]   who are not pastors, who actually we're going to give an opportunity to preach the Word
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.200]   of God.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.960]   And we did it last year and the next slide will show you what we're going to do.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.160]   This is really going to excite you.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.720]   Next week, Bonnie will be preaching.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.200]   She's going to have more people here than I am.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   I know that, right?
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.440]   I mean, the place is going to be packed, right?
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.060]   I know that.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.800]   But Bonnie is going to draw these six weeks together and preach a sermon that she's done
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.120]   for her master's course.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.480]   She's studying master's in theology at the moment.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   And she's got to...
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.240]   Look, I've got one advantage over you.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   I've seen it.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.540]   This is going to be a great sermon.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.680]   So please, next week, come out in force.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:10.080]   Bonnie is going to be preaching on the 25th of June, next Saturday, at White Church.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.720]   I'm excited.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.860]   And then a couple of weeks after, I'm going to talk a little bit about faith and work
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.860]   in a moment.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.620]   But Anthony has been working with me as an intern this year.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.580]   He's finishing off his master's in Dallas this year.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.660]   And his speciality is faith in the workplace and linking them up.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.600]   And Antony and I are going to do a two-part series.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.120]   So I'll do the first part and Antony will do the second part.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.380]   So Antony will be preaching here on July the 9th.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.720]   I just really want to encourage you, anyone who wants to know about what it is to be a
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.540]   Christian at work is there.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.060]   And then after that, we're going to be doing a series in Ecclesiastes.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.860]   It's a 12-week series.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.380]   And I'm pleased to say that we've got Gabe, who's going to be talking.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.740]   He's got the best chapter in Ecclesiastes 3.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.740]   Go home and read it.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.060]   It's amazing.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.060]   And then Paul's going to be preaching.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.800]   Now, Gabe and Paul both preached last year.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.360]   They both knocked it out the park.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.860]   Now why are we doing this?
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.120]   Because to us, raising up the next generation is important.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.620]   It's more important for us than to have the pastor up here every week or to have a guest
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.100]   speaker every other week.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.920]   We really want to do this.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.940]   So please get behind this.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.540]   We've got four of our people at the moment.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.100]   If you think you should be G5, come and see me.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.900]   And we'll keep doing it.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.880]   The next one relates to our talk with Anthony.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:41.840]   You know, for six weeks now, we've said numbers are being added daily.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.680]   And no one's really said, "Well, where do I go daily?"
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.720]   It's not here.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   It's to your workplace.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.800]   And Anthony and I have a real heart.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.760]   There are people in this church like David Wong and others who have a real heart for
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.120]   faith and the workplace.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:03.960]   So we'll be doing a two-week series after this series, actually looking at faith in
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   the workplace.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   And I think you'll be very, very encouraged to that.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.680]   And we're going to pray for all of you in your jobs.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:15.080]   You know, we really want to encourage you as workplace ministers.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.400]   Next thing is church with a mission.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.280]   And obviously, we want to continue doing local mission trips.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.760]   This year has been mainly local mission trips, you know, with feeding the poor and the masks
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.080]   and the rat tests and things like that.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.360]   We want to continue doing that.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.000]   I don't know how Philippines got up there, but we'll start an overseas mission trip as
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.680]   soon as we possibly can.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.280]   And Johnny's just waiting to go.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.520]   His leg's tapping already to go.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   That's why he's in the picture.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   Alpha course in the...
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:49.520]   I was just going to say, if any of you saw that baptism today and said, "How do I get
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520]   baptized?"
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   Go on the next alpha course.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.260]   That's the way to start, right?
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.800]   So we're doing that in the autumn.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:02.560]   And one thing, if I can mention, Julia has committed herself to KFCI.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.200]   Julia is also a missionary and minister.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.720]   She has a real heart for domestic helpers.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:14.880]   And she said to me and Sandra, she said, "I want to come to KFCI on Saturdays because
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.920]   I want to keep my Sundays free for going out and ministering to the Filipino helpers."
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.600]   So it registered with us.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.800]   Michelle's got behind it.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.920]   So we're actually going to be looking at how we can reach out to this side of society that
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.200]   a lot of Hong Kong society ignores.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.240]   So really watch this space.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   If you've got a heart for a minister, go and see Julia afterwards.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.400]   She said, "Wave your hand, Julia," at the back afterwards.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   And we'll do this.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   But these are...
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.440]   I just want to get you excited about what we're doing.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.680]   We're building a kingdom.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:56.400]   But I want to ask you to be part of this.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.720]   You know, I want to challenge you.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:08.480]   I want to challenge you to be a kingdom builder.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:17.880]   The beauty about the church in Acts, there's no superstar preacher or pastor or evangelist
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:26.240]   or there's no Joseph Prince or Brian Houston or anyone in the book of Acts.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:39.440]   Time after time in the book of Acts, we use the word "they" or "all" or "every one of them."
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:46.760]   Church is not a place for passengers or observers.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.400]   I'll say that again.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.920]   I believe this intently.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:57.760]   This church is not a church for passengers or observers.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.200]   You can come once and have a look, but no, seriously.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:11.080]   I want every one of you, every one of you to join me in building the kingdom.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:19.280]   And I want you to do it right here and right now.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.820]   Let's stop playing church.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.840]   Let's get serious and build the kingdom.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.160]   And I'm going to invite Michelle to come forward because she's going to do a little exercise
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.880]   with you that I think you'll enjoy very, very much.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.800]   So all over to you, Michelle.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
