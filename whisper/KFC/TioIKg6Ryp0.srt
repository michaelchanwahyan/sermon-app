1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,220
 Hello. All right. It seems my shoes are a hot topic these last few weeks. This is one

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:21,080
 third of my shoe collection. All right. So anyway, me and my wife Mel, we have this dog.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,940
 Technically we're dog sitting. He's a Sheba and he's very cute. His name is Kit. Many

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,640
 people here know him and he even has his own little fan club. And he's very cute because

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,240
 instead of barking, he likes to speak. Instead of barking, he'll be like, "Rawr, rawr, rawr,

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:47,880
 rawr." And so we love it. But this dog requires time and attention. Now I, as an important

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,320
 person, sometimes have important things to do. Now that might be going to work, might

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,320
 be picking up Mel, et cetera. Now Kit, I wouldn't say he's a distraction. He's a dog in need

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,440
 of care and attention. But it can be inconvenient that he can get in the way while I'm trying

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,840
 to get on with more important things. This actually happened just this afternoon. I was

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,760
 going through this sermon and then he's terrified of thunder and some dark clouds formed. I

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,240
 couldn't hear any thunder. But as I'm at my computer, he comes up and reaches out, shaking

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,480
 and trembling. Now I'm like, "Oh, can't you see I have more important things to do. I'm

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,960
 trying to prepare God's word. Come on." But he needed my care and attention. Don't worry.

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,980
 I played with him and he calmed down more because of the clouds subsiding than anything

16
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,080
 I did. But now this situation for me, this is very low stakes, but we could just see

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,880
 a little bit in this story that Jesus is on his way to this important task of healing

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:01,800
 this synagogue leader's daughter when this nameless outcast woman comes to him for her

19
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:09,800
 own healing. So quick recap, Jesus is on the shore of the lake. A synagogue leader named

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,160
 Jairus comes and begs Jesus to heal his daughter who is at the point of death. So they set

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,600
 out on their way. Then out of the crowd, this nameless woman approaches Jesus, touches his

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,320
 garment and is healed from a bleeding that she'd suffered for 12 years. Jairus is then

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,400
 informed his daughter has died and then Jesus goes on anyway. Instead of just healing her,

24
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,540
 he raises her from the dead. Now this is an amazing story of Jesus overcoming seemingly

25
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,840
 impossible circumstances. And this is also recounted in Matthew 9 and Luke 8. However,

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,560
 the longest and most detailed version of this story is actually in the shortest of all the

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,080
 gospels, Mark. Now the woman and the young girl are often referred to as the two daughters.

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,280
 And we see there are quite a few points of similarities and also some contrasts. And

29
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,160
 this is something Mark really tries to spoon feed to us. In both of these cases, we see

30
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,600
 great examples of faith in the face of hopeless circumstances. Both come at a risk. For Jairus,

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,200
 his reputation as the synagogue leader. For the woman, further consequences for breaking

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,440
 her quarantine. Both are unclean. Firstly, the woman, according to Leviticus 15, and

33
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,540
 with the young girl, according to Numbers 19 11, where anyone who touches a corpse will

34
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,760
 become unclean for seven days. Both are called daughter. The woman called daughter by Christ

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,280
 himself and the young girl, a daughter of Jairus, who is advocating for her. And then

36
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,960
 12 years, the woman has had 12 years of suffering and the girl in this story is 12 years old.

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,000
 And in both of these, the care that Jesus shows for them goes beyond their request.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,760
 The differences, however, are pretty stark. Jairus is a synagogue leader while the woman

39
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,320
 is a lowly and now poor outcast. Jairus can offer status and good standing. The woman

40
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,760
 has nothing to offer Jesus. Jairus is able to approach Jesus face to face where the woman

41
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,240
 in fear of potential consequences comes behind and in secret. One healing is in public, one

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,360
 in private. I don't mean like Queen Mary and sanatorium. While the woman's heal is out

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,920
 in public for all to see, the young woman is healed in private with only a select few

44
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,740
 privileged to witness. And finally to the 12 years, we see 12 years of joy with one

45
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:43,440
 daughter and 12 years of suffering. Often in this story, we tend to focus on the great

46
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,120
 faith of these people and the healing power of Jesus. Both of these are extremely important

47
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,800
 and we will look at these, but what we want to focus on is the heart of Jesus here and

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,820
 how he cares for them. And then as Christ followers, how we can then care for others

49
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,560
 as he has shown us. So in order to see that more fully, we need to gain a greater understanding

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,720
 of these characters. So who is Jairus? So in verse 22, we see he's one of the synagogue

51
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,880
 rulers. He wasn't a priest, but was in charge of a lot such as conducting of public worship,

52
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,920
 reading of scriptures, procuring of scrolls, arranging of Sabbath worship, et cetera. This

53
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,880
 was a man well respected and holding influence in the community. And at this time there was

54
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,320
 a lot of overlap between the synagogues and then public life, politics, et cetera. So

55
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,720
 this was a man well respected. And if it's not clear enough, actually it's significant

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,400
 that we know Jairus' name. Mark was written by Mark from the account of Peter. So this

57
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,000
 man was prominent enough that Peter knew who he was and remembered him. Now, what's the

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,400
 big deal of Jairus coming to Jesus? Why would this be risk or taboo? If we look back at

59
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,000
 Mark 3, there's a story of Jesus healing on the Sabbath. This leads to Mark 3 verse 6,

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,960
 where the Pharisees started to plot with the Herodians at how they might kill Jesus. Later

61
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,560
 in that same chapter, Jesus was accused by the teachers of law of being demon possessed

62
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,360
 by Beelzebul, the prince of demons. Jairus knew who Jesus was, hence why he came to him

63
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,240
 to ask for his help. However, being a ruler of the synagogue, many of the reports by which

64
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,200
 he would have come to know Jesus were likely quite unfavourable. But unable to do anything

65
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,920
 to fix his own daughter's health, he comes before Jesus and falls at his feet, pleading,

66
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,400
 "Please come to my daughter so that she may live." Given how Jesus was viewed, there was

67
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,880
 risk for Jairus in doing this, even in acknowledging him, let alone begging at his feet. Can you

68
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,520
 imagine if down at Central Harbour, there was this new young pastor who was somewhat

69
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,200
 controversial, making waves, and he comes in on the Star Ferry on a busy Sunday afternoon.

70
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,960
 All of a sudden, Pastor John runs down, falls at his feet, "Help! Help! I need your help!"

71
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:28,320
 This is the kind of scene that we're looking at. He's actually debasing himself, and it's

72
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,400
 a bit of an embarrassing scene, or an uncomfortable scene. Now Jairus says, "Come put your hands

73
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,720
 on her so that she will be healed and live." He is convinced that Jesus can heal his daughter.

74
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,640
 Jairus shows faith beyond doubt, and is willing to exercise that faith at the expense of other

75
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:54,680
 comforts he enjoys. And here it's important to ask ourselves, are we willing to do that?

76
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,640
 From wherever we come from in society, that may be a successful CEO, a real estate mogul,

77
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,920
 a pastor, celebrity, teacher, student, wherever that may be, are we willing to let go of whatever

78
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,960
 security we cling to, and to come to Jesus as a grovelling beggar, regardless of what

79
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,440
 it may look like to others, knowing that only he is the one with all power and authority,

80
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,920
 declaring that we need him. Now this is all any of us can do when it comes to our salvation.

81
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,960
 I've achieved this and that, but it is nothing. My only hope is falling down before Jesus

82
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,160
 as a hopeless beggar. Now Jesus has compassion on Jairus and his daughter, and he agrees

83
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,040
 to go. All right, so then in this story, we're coming up to Jesus' big moment. If he can

84
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 heal Jairus' daughter, the Pharisees and teachers will know he's legit, and everyone will get

85
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,160
 on board the Jesus train. Remember Jairus has good standing. This may be like doing

86
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,400
 a favour for someone high up in the jockey club or something. If I can get this person

87
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,920
 on my side, this whole town's mine. Yeah, that kind of thing. Ipso facto, everyone loves

88
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,640
 Jesus. What could be more important than that? Now, on the way to Jairus' place, we see this

89
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,720
 woman who had suffered from bleeding for 12 years. She had spent all her resources with

90
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,420
 physicians and her condition had only gotten worse. Not wanting to cause a scene, she comes

91
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:31,280
 up behind Jesus, touches his cloak, and then instant healing. She knows it, and Jesus feels

92
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,080
 power going out from him. This woman heard about Jesus and knew that if she could just

93
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:43,720
 touch his cloak, she'd be healed. Now, this is one of two of the big healing climaxes

94
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,440
 in this story, and they are amazing. This woman is healed instantly. Jesus has the power

95
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:58,560
 and authority and care to bring healing. This is worthy of our awe and praise. Make no mistake.

96
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,960
 Jesus is able to heal and heal instantly. Now, how is this applicable to us to go and

97
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,120
 do likewise? God has given each of us different gifts and can give us spiritual gifts. And

98
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,480
 for some of us, that does include the gift of healing as well. But whatever gifts that

99
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:26,480
 we have and whatever he's gifted to you, we need to use that to care for others. Now,

100
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,580
 there are a few things in this situation that now Jesus would have given Jesus just the

101
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,720
 right to carry on. Firstly, they had somewhere to be, and not somewhere insignificant. A

102
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,120
 young girl was at death's door. I checked with my wife, Mel, who's an ICU doctor, and

103
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,680
 even though there is a lack of detail in the diagnosis here, she was able to confirm that

104
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:58,480
 the state of dying does register as being quite urgent. So secondly, unlike Jairus,

105
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,720
 the woman had nothing to offer Jesus. Thirdly, the woman was unclean. Her act jeopardized

106
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,400
 Jesus and also was a risk to the rest of the people there. What this woman did may be like

107
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,720
 someone in 2020 coming and asking for help and coughing all over your face in the process.

108
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 You've put me at risk and now I can't go and help anyone else. You know, best to move on

109
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,280
 without drawing attention to it. And fourthly, she was already healed. Good deed done. Time

110
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,880
 to move on. Let's get this show back on the road. If I had been in a situation, I'd probably

111
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 just go on, you know, you're welcome, good luck, and keep on going. If I'm being honest,

112
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,280
 I might even do this if I'm just heading home to watch Netflix, you know, let alone going

113
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:49,680
 somewhere important. But what does Jesus do? He cares for her. He turns around, he seeks

114
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,360
 out who touched my clothes. Now on the face of it, this is just an insane question. You

115
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,800
 can see the disciples are like, what are you talking about? Literally everyone is touching

116
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,840
 you. Verse 24 tells us that the crowds were pressed against him. This isn't leading just

117
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,960
 like an entourage and in some photo scenic shoot through, through the streets. This is

118
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,280
 a chaotic scene. It's like going to Chinese new year flower markets or the front row of

119
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,400
 Jay Chow and then saying, did someone just, did I just touch someone's shoulders? Like

120
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:31,280
 this is a chaotic, chaotic scene. Now the disciples wanted to keep moving, but not Jesus.

121
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:39,120
 He persists until the woman comes forward. Jesus takes precious time with this woman.

122
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,400
 And we've probably all heard the saying in many different iterations, but where you spend

123
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,960
 your time is what you value. Often we hear this in like a motivational context, you know,

124
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,440
 let's hit those career goals or whatever. But think of Jesus here spending the precious

125
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,560
 time with this woman and what impact that has. A few weeks ago, Michelle spoke about,

126
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,920
 you know, Jesus accepting the rejected by staying close to them. At this time, he could

127
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:11,560
 have easily moved on. He accepts this rejected woman and stays close to her. Jesus care takes

128
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,480
 time. And what about us? Does our time value the lowly, the difficult, those suffering

129
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,760
 with mental illness? Does our use of time show that we care for others or does it just

130
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,840
 show self-importance? How often would we be willing to let some intruder into our space

131
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,960
 and stop us from getting to our important place? It could even be a ministry like, like

132
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:41,120
 what in Jesus case. Yeah, I know for me as an introvert who values punctuality and likes

133
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,900
 to know what's going to happen in my day, this is a struggle for me. Yeah. So now this

134
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,720
 isn't permission just to be late. So please, please, for my sanity's sake, don't misunderstand

135
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,200
 me. But it wouldn't it be great if whenever we were say late somewhere, instead of it

136
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,880
 just being like, Oh, I just forgot to leave on time. But instead we thought, I just, I

137
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,720
 just saw someone who needed a meal and then they need to talk through some issues and

138
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,120
 I just had to care for them. Yeah. What if we got to church and we're like, where's

139
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,880
 the worship team today? And it's like, well, everyone was on their way, but God showed

140
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,400
 them someone he loves and we just couldn't help but care for them. Hope everyone likes

141
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:29,960
 singing how great is our God, but wouldn't this actually be amazing? So Jesus persists.

142
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,840
 She comes, falls at his feet and tells him the truth. She comes with fear, which is very

143
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,600
 rational. She's meant to be quarantined, not to make anyone else unclean. She had thought

144
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,280
 if she could just get physical healing, then I can sneak away, wait it out and go through

145
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,240
 the ritual of ceremonial cleansing and then reenter society. Surely Jesus is about to

146
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,120
 scold her. How dare you? You've put me and all these others at risk, but Jesus not content

147
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,160
 with her just having physical healing, wants to restore her fully. He says to her, daughter,

148
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:14,720
 your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering. His care welcomes

149
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,240
 her in. Now this is the only time recorded that Jesus calls someone daughter. Jesus calls

150
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,680
 this woman he hadn't met, was ostracized and in suffering, daughter. And remember this

151
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,320
 context, this is in front of a crowd that had just seen Jairus come and plead for the

152
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,520
 case of his daughter. So Jesus in front of this crowd calls this woman who had been outcast

153
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,120
 daughter saying to her and this crowd, see this love that Jairus has for his daughter,

154
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,080
 how precious she is to him. This is the care that I have for this woman. Hey everyone,

155
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,280
 see this woman who just went through 12 years of suffering. She is loved by me and I call

156
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,760
 her daughter. See how Jairus pleaded with me for his daughter. Well, I advocate to the

157
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,680
 father for her, just as he does for each of us. 1 John 2, 1 says we have an advocate with

158
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:18,220
 the father, Jesus Christ. Jesus welcomes her in, not just as a friend or fellow citizen,

159
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:25,440
 as he's loved and cherished daughter for all to see. Now do we care for people by welcoming

160
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:35,240
 them in, not just keeping them as outsiders, but truly you're part as part of our family.

161
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,400
 And this same action, he brings her into the kingdom. Just as Jesus welcomes us into the

162
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:47,240
 God's kingdom by taking our sins, here he is bringing her into this kingdom. And this

163
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,040
 is a very important part of our care for others. We need to be caring for others spiritually,

164
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,160
 knowing them Jesus, inviting them into the kingdom with actions and words, not either

165
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:06,120
 or and nurturing their walk with Jesus once they know him. Now, normally in this time

166
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,800
 after recovering from this, she would need to still go see a priest for cleansing. In

167
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,840
 Mark chapter one, Jesus commands Leopard to do this after he heals him. However, this

168
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:24,360
 was primarily done as a testimony to the priest. But here Jesus makes no such command. He is

169
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,640
 the high priest. She is fully restored. She comes seeking physical healing, but Jesus

170
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,720
 cares for her far beyond her expectations and hopes, beyond what she even thinks she

171
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,400
 needs. He wants to do so much more than just take care of her physical healing. He gives

172
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,160
 her ceremonial healing, social restoration, and a spiritual home. He goes beyond what

173
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,520
 is asked, doing much more than what she thought to seek out. And he's also really holistic

174
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,080
 in nature. So back to Jairus. Here in the story, now we see Jairus receives the news

175
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,080
 that his daughter has died. Jesus was aware of what Jairus must have been going through.

176
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,360
 And as he receives the news, Jesus comforts Jairus, "Don't be afraid. Just believe."

177
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,200
 So even though Jesus is already going to help Jairus by literally raising his daughter from

178
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 the dead, he doesn't abandon him. He's present with Jairus, comforting him and encouraging

179
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,360
 his faith in this extremely difficult time. And then we get to Jairus' home. We see the

180
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,800
 mourners. This would have been yet another chaotic, loud scene. At this time, it was

181
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,640
 required even for poor people to have at least two flute players and one professional mourner.

182
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,320
 Jairus, being someone of higher stature, it could be assumed that there were considerably

183
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,760
 more. Add to that just family and friends who were there mourning. So quite a chaotic

184
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:03,400
 scene. And then when Jesus declares, "She is not dead, but asleep," they laugh at him.

185
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,560
 A quick look again at the faith of Jairus. Firstly, there are so many times when he could

186
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,040
 have just given up faith in Jesus. Firstly, the risks of even going to him in the first

187
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,440
 place. Then hearing his daughter has died. Now in the face of scoffers. I mean, do you

188
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:28,400
 want to be associated with this joker or reality? We need to remember there are so many chances

189
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,000
 for us as well to lose our faith in Jesus. But we need to always be refocusing on Jesus.

190
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,640
 Refocusing on him. It's not a one-time event. So Jairus keeps his faith in Jesus and Jesus

191
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,520
 privileges just the girl's parents and James, John and Peter to witness the miracle of him

192
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,880
 raising this girl from the dead. Jesus takes it by the hand. Remember, according to numbers,

193
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,480
 this would make him unclean for seven days. Again, he goes beyond his initial requests

194
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,440
 made by Jairus and the girl is raised from the dead. Now Jesus tells them to get the

195
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,400
 girl something to eat. Even after this healing, he's looking out for her wellbeing. Now, verse

196
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,760
 43 is an extremely important verse where we see more of Jesus' character. We see he gives

197
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,120
 strict orders not to tell anyone about this. I mean, why? Does he not want to rub it in

198
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:33,400
 the face of the naysayers outside? Does he not want vindication amongst the community?

199
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,720
 Jesus often gave this command after healing. He was careful not to hinder his ministry

200
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,440
 and did not want the physical healings and miracles to be the central focus of his ministry.

201
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,680
 In Mark chapter one, we see him make this same command, which then he's disobeyed and

202
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,180
 he is swamped so much that he can no longer openly enter towns, but stayed outside in

203
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,820
 lonely places. There's also an element of danger. We know that there were already plots

204
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,080
 to kill him already coming together. So by having people go and tell of this amazing

205
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,420
 miracle, it could actually detract from Jesus' primary mission, restoring our relationship

206
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:19,060
 with the father. But as we see here, he also cares about every other aspect of our lives.

207
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,460
 So what does this tell us about Jesus? While we may have thought that caring for Jairus

208
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:32,460
 could give us some good returns, Jesus' care for Jairus and his daughter was never self-seeking.

209
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,100
 The first healing he did was in public, partly because it was in that moment, but then afterwards

210
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,860
 was that the woman needed public restoration. This one, however, was done in private, deliberately

211
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,260
 away from the crowds. It was never about boosting his reputation and standing. In fact, it was

212
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:55,380
 potentially detrimental to him and his ministry. But this was the love he had for Jairus and

213
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,060
 his daughter. He saw his face, he had compassion, and despite what cost it may have brought

214
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:09,300
 upon himself and his ministry, he loved and he acted on that and cared for them. Now,

215
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,700
 how about us? Do we care about others for some potential later reward, or just because

216
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,900
 we genuinely love them? Or do we do this in choosing who we show care to in the first

217
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,780
 place? So we look at the two characters in the story, how different they both are. We

218
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,060
 see that Jesus doesn't discriminate with his care. We see Jesus bring healing to a

219
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:40,100
 nameless woman with no social status, and at a time where women often weren't counted

220
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,740
 or considered reliable witnesses. He doesn't weigh up, "Look, I could help this woman,

221
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,220
 but what am I going to get out of it?" Jesus takes time from what many of us would consider

222
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,100
 to be the more important task, to care for and validate this woman when it would have

223
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:03,780
 been so much easier to move on. But what about Jairus? We know Jesus loves the poor, he elevates

224
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,740
 them. But here we see he also cares and loves about those with status and resources. This

225
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,340
 doesn't put Jairus out of his love and grace. Just like this woman, Jairus and his daughter

226
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:23,020
 are completely reliant on Jesus, not partly. One of them does not need Jesus any more or

227
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:29,180
 less than the other. Their standing does nothing for them. They both need Jesus completely,

228
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:37,980
 100%. And he cares for them above or despite reputation, purity, expectation, status, etc.

229
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,660
 Now, how about us? Do we look at the lowly and think, "Ah, not important enough for

230
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,340
 me." Or do we do the opposite, looking at those with status saying, "They live on

231
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:55,220
 the peak. They're fine. They're a pastor. They're good. My care is going to those

232
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:03,220
 who truly need it." In both of these situations, we see Jesus go above and beyond what is asked.

233
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,020
 The woman just wants physical healing. Jesus gives her social and spiritual healing. Jairus

234
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,540
 seeks out healing for his sick daughter. Jesus goes and raises her from the dead, comforting

235
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,660
 Jairus along the way and on and on. He cares deeply and won't settle for saying, "I've

236
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:24,660
 done my bit. Nothing else in it for me. Kind of diminishing returns from here." He doesn't

237
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,380
 think of it this way. And think of it, if we're caring for a loved one, we don't

238
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:35,700
 just go give him a Panadol and, "Yeah, that'll be enough." Like, I hope not anyway.

239
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,300
 But no, we try to do everything we can for them and make sure they're okay. We see

240
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:46,140
 this in Jairus breaking down before Jesus. This is the love that Jesus has towards this

241
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:53,580
 woman and to Jairus and his daughter. And it's important to pause here for anyone who

242
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:02,500
 may not know, but this is the care that Jesus has for each of us. For you, for you, for

243
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:12,580
 me, and all of us. He cares for each of us in this way. As followers of Christ, we are

244
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,860
 called to follow Christ's example in this. In this story, we saw some amazing examples

245
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,260
 of faith, but we aren't called to be Jairusites. We're called to be Christians. The one we

246
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,740
 are called to be like is the one ministering to these people. And we are to do likewise

247
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:36,740
 to the lady on the MTR, the man under the bridge, the real estate mogul, or that politician.

248
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,900
 So how does our care look in comparison? You know, looking at this, what do we do? Do we

249
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,400
 use our gifts to care for others? Do we value others with our time? Do we truly welcome

250
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,180
 those on the outside in? Do we invite people into his wonderful kingdom? Do we do the bare

251
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,260
 minimum or do we go beyond what is asked of us? Are we present with people who need our

252
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:05,080
 care? Are we self-seeking with some ulterior motive? Or do we genuinely care for others?

253
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:11,660
 And how do we discriminate one way or another in who we care for? Now this, I know, is a

254
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,420
 little bit overwhelming. And honestly, I don't know about you, but when I look at the standard

255
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:24,740
 that Jesus sets in this story, I can't live up to that, honestly. Maybe, maybe like a

256
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:32,540
 teeny fraction, but I can't care for others in this, in this degree that he does. I mean,

257
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,820
 look at this list, for example. But this is not a guilt trip. You know, this care that

258
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:44,660
 is shown by Jesus in this story is, is actually supernatural. It's well and truly beyond us.

259
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:51,060
 But hold on a moment. See, as Christians, we instinctively look at the miracle of healing

260
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,020
 in this story. And we know that for something like that, we need to rely on God and rightly

261
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:02,380
 so. But what else do we see in this story? We see Jesus breaking barriers of social stigma,

262
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,860
 publicly welcoming an outcast in his family, offering comfort, not showing favoritism based

263
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:14,180
 on worldly status, bringing people into right relationship with him, etc. Jesus cared because

264
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:20,380
 he loved them, because that's who he is. And just as we need great faith and to rely on

265
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:27,460
 him to do these miracles, as he does, we also need to exercise faith and rely wholly on

266
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,180
 him to care for others in the way that he does. You know, you know, that warning of,

267
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,540
 you know, do not try this at home. Well, it's kind of similar here. Do not try this in your

268
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,940
 own strength. It's a kind of love that amazes the world because it's beyond what they're

269
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,980
 used to. So by definition, it's not natural. The lesson isn't that Jesus set this example.

270
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,820
 So we need to run around making sure we care a whole lot, burning ourselves out. I think

271
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,420
 this is, can be a common mistake we can make. That just that we love and care for the others

272
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,760
 to this level because we're good, we're good people. No, remember what James talked about

273
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,780
 last week. We are Christians because we acknowledge that we are sinners and that we fall short

274
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:19,340
 and we need Jesus. We know we should love like Jesus does, but it's hard. We need Jesus

275
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:26,460
 in order to care like he did. I hope that's at least a relief to you because the standard

276
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:34,060
 Jesus sets is so high, it's burdensome for us to try to do this in our own strength.

277
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:41,660
 But this doesn't mean we're off the hook either. We are called to do this, so we must grow.

278
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,500
 Now we've broken down a few ways just to see the depth of care that Jesus has. And these

279
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,940
 really are manifestations of his love. Think of that famous, think of the famous John 3

280
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,940
 16, "For God so loved the world, he gave his one and only son. Whoever believes in him shall

281
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:03,000
 not perish, but have eternal life." If we look at this, because God loved us, he sent

282
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,020
 Jesus to come and take care of our greatest deed, which is salvation and eternal life

283
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:13,420
 in him. Or think of the example Jesus gives with the Good Samaritan in talking about the

284
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,380
 commandment to love our neighbor as ourselves. He depicts that as this Good Samaritan taking

285
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,820
 care of this other man's, this stranger's needs. If we want to truly care, we need to

286
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,980
 truly love. We want to love like Jesus loved, seeing others as he sees them, valuing them

287
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,820
 as he does. It is then that our care for others will look like what he has shown us here as

288
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,660
 we operate in his strength rather than our own.

289
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:50,740
 All right, so here is my practical challenge for all of us. This is a small challenge that

290
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:57,020
 anyone can do. Now, is there anyone here that goes about their day every day and never sees

291
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:03,880
 or hears or comes in contact with another person? No one? Good, good. So we're all able

292
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,460
 to do this. We're all eligible. All right, a great place for this might be an MTR or

293
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,100
 a bus. You know those busy places where we get mad at everyone else for making it busy,

294
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:21,220
 but not ourselves. I don't make it busy. Everyone else does. Or a restaurant, a park,

295
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,620
 somewhere where you're idle for at least five minutes is ideal. But the challenge is this,

296
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:34,020
 just find one person. Don't stare at them, but just ask God to help you see them as he

297
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:41,640
 sees them. Spend some time praying for them. Ask God to help you value this one precious

298
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,840
 person out of the nearly eight million people in this city. What better thing to do in our

299
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:55,340
 commute or lunch break? We want to do this daily, making it a habit that we just genuinely

300
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:01,380
 love and care about the people around us and get that in our hearts first. And then as

301
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:08,320
 we grow, we can more and more, bit by bit, be living out the example that Jesus sets

302
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:16,980
 out in this story, bringing glory to him. Let's pray. Lord, we thank you that you care

303
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:25,700
 for each and every one of us so deeply. We thank you that you are a God who goes beyond

304
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:33,380
 our expectations, what we ask for. You are present with us. And Lord, you are good to

305
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:41,460
 us. And we ask that you would give us strength to love and care like you do. That we would

306
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:48,060
 see those around us as you see them. That you would help us in this, Lord. And we ask

307
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:58,220
 for your grace in this as we fall short. And Lord, we give our hearts to you, Lord. And

308
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:05,300
 we ask that you would be doing your will in us. And that in and through us, Lord, you

309
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,420
 will be revealing more and more of yourself to the world. It is in your name. Amen.
