1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(字幕製作:貝爾)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,360
好,今天我們就會說

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,880
平安

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
Peace

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,520
如果我們用一個字去describe 2022

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,520
你會用什麼字呢?

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,720
Describe 2022

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,280
你會用什麼字呢?

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,680
Everybody shout out their word, okay?

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,080
Shout out with their word

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
你會用什麼字呢?

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
Stuck

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Stuck, okay,還有呢?

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
What word would you use?

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
VAR

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
Okay

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,080
世界盃VAR, okay

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
(笑)

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
我會用一個字

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
就是Uncertainty

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Uncertainty, okay

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,080
為什麼呢?因為我們還有

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
一個Virus

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Coronavirus, 是不是?

25
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
上年Omicron

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
was the height of Omicron

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
我那時就在

28
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,080
在多倫多

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
在Omicron那時,多倫多

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Okay, and then

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
We had all these lockdowns, right?

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
We had all these lockdowns

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
有沒有人lockdown過的?

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
在香港,有沒有人?

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Do you remember?

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
你不知道喔,可能你的building

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
有幾個case,他就lockdown

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
你的building

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
然後又要test,又要

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
isolate幾天, okay

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
So it was a tough time

42
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
of isolation

43
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
of Coronavirus, it was not

44
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,080
fun, it was not fun

45
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
還有什麼發生?

46
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
2月那時有什麼發生?

47
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
有什麼發生,記不記得?

48
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
有什麼發生?

49
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Big event

50
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
in February, 有什麼發生?

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
記不記得?

52
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Why? Chinese New Year?

53
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
不是日語,不是這樣

54
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Chinese

55
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Okay, another big event that happened was

56
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Ukraine being attacked

57
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
by

58
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Ukraine being attacked

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
I can pretend I didn't hear that

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
being attacked by Russia

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
and that changed a lot of things

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
that were happening in the world

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
a lot of things that were happening

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
in the world

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
And we saw thousands of refugees

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
being displaced all over Europe

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
And that led to the threat of a nuclear war

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
And that led to the threat of a nuclear war

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
There's like a threat of a nuclear war

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
It's serious, right?

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Russia, US

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
They have the most nuclear weapons

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
in the world

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
And with that comes the rise of energy prices

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
And with that comes the rise of energy prices

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Energy prices

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
And the stock markets went crazy

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
The markets went crazy

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Housing has gone down

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
There's a lot of uncertainty

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
In the world

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
And something also very bad happened

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
And something also very bad happened

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Someone very famous died

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
What was her name?

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Queen Elizabeth

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Queen Elizabeth

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
And she was reigning

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
For many, many years

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
And it was a shock

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
And it was a shock

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
To have the queen die

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
To have the queen die

94
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
It was not all sad

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
2022

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
It's just a lot of bad events

97
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
It's just a lot of bad events

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
There were some positive events

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Travel started to happen

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
People started traveling again

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Who's traveling soon?

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Who's traveling soon?

103
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Where are you going?

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Barcelona?

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Ok, don't get robbed

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Where are you going?

107
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Canada?

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Where are you going?

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Japan

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Who's going to Japan soon?

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Everyone is going to Japan

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Or is in Japan right now

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Ok, what else happened?

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
What VAR event happened?

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
What VAR event happened?

116
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
World Cup

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Who thinks it was the best

118
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
World Cup finals ever?

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Raise your hand

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
For those who didn't raise their hand

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

123
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

124
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

125
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

126
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

129
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

130
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

131
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

132
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

133
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

134
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Do you know who's the messy fan?

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Yeah, 8 billion people

136
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
That's a lot of people

137
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
A lot of people

138
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
So what I would say is that

139
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,080
2022 was a year of uncertainty

140
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,080
There's social and political uncertainty

141
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
There's still a lot of protests

142
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
around the world

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
There's a lot of political uncertainty around the world

144
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,080
There's economical and financial uncertainty

145
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
There's a threat of a recession

146
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Financial difficulty happening

147
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
There's the global health uncertainty

148
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
We still don't know

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
How the virus is gonna end

150
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
If it will end

151
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
And there is the uncertainty of the environment

152
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Global warming

153
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Global warming

154
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
And also in Jesus' time

155
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
There was also uncertainty

156
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
What kind of uncertainty?

157
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,080
What was the major power of that time?

158
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,080
It was the Roman Empire

159
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
And so they gave uncertainty to Israel

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Because they were always a threat

161
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
And the disciples were thinking

162
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Wow, Jesus is the Messiah

163
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
He's come to save us

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
But then he said he's leaving

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
他去哪了?

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
他說我去那裡

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
你來不了

168
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
你來不了

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
為什麼來不了?

170
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
And he says this

171
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
He promises this to the disciples

172
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
in the midst of uncertainty

173
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
He says this

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Peace I leave with you

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
My peace I give to you

176
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Not as the world gives

177
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Do I give to you

178
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Let not your hearts be troubled

179
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Neither let them be afraid

180
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
And so Jesus promises peace

181
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
平安

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
你覺得平安的定義是什麼?

183
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
What is your definition of peace?

184
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
和你旁邊那個

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
談談你覺得平安的定義是什麼?

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
說一下

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Ok, what is your definition of peace?

188
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Ok, 我們先問這些女生

189
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080

190
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
What is your definition of peace?

191
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Mentor Annie 那組

192
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Sean 走了

194
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Sean 走了就是有peace

195
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Wow

196
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Wow

197
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Ok

198
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Ok 你那組呢?

199
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
有什麼定義?

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
平安是什麼?

201
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
不知道 不知道平安是什麼

202
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
喝湯

203
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Calm

204
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Calm, ok

205
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
喝湯也可以是平安的

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Ok 你們呢?

207
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
你那組呢?

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
平衡

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
平衡, ok, that's a good definition

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
平衡, ok, very good

211
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Pierre 你們這些男生有沒有定義?

212
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
No conflict, ok, very good

213
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
誰是no conflict的?

214
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
有沒有人是no conflict的?

215
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Ok, Winnie 你的女生呢?

216
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Are they searching it up on their phone right now?

217
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
It looks like it

218
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
What is peace on Google, right?

219
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
是嗎?

220
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
What is your definition, girls?

221
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
這些女生,什麼定義?

222
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:12,080
我們看一下這些女生

223
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
讓她們說定義

224
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
哈哈哈

225
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
What is peace?

226
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
平安是什麼?

227
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Quietness

228
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
哈哈哈

229
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Ok

230
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Ok, what about the boys?

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Lucas 你們呢?

232
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
What is the definition of peace?

233
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
The absence of bullying?

234
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
哈哈哈

235
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Ok

236
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
很多人呢

237
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
覺得平安是什麼?

238
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
是沒有conflict

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
是沒有trouble的

240
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
是嗎? The absence of conflict

241
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
The absence of trouble

242
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
是什麼? Relax

243
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
好像在這個沙灘

244
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Relax, calm

245
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
沒有東西煩你,是舒服的

246
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
That is what we strive for

247
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
in terms of this world

248
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
and peace

249
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
But Jesus

250
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
He's not just saying peace

251
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
In the Old Testament

252
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
they would use shalom

253
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Ok, shalom means peace

254
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
and they would usually greet each other

255
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
是嗎?

256
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
你跟人家say hello

257
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Hello, bye bye

258
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
在猶太人呢

259
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
就會說shalom, peace

260
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Peace be with you

261
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
你走的時候也是shalom, peace be with you

262
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
但耶穌呢

263
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
不只是說bye bye

264
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
不是只是say hello

265
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
or bye bye

266
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
他是說peace I leave with you

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Peace I give to you

268
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,080
耶穌的平安是什麼?

269
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
It is from him

270
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
He's saying I give you peace

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Jesus will give you peace

272
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
My peace I give to you

273
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
還有呢

274
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
這個平安不是世界的平安

275
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,080
This is peace that the world cannot give

276
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,080
世界的平安和耶穌的平安是不同的

277
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
It's different

278
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
It is different

279
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
We learn here that Jesus provides peace

280
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
It's personal

281
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
and it is prized

282
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,080
I have this saying here

283
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Peace does not come from your situation

284
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
but from your foundation

285
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Peace doesn't come from your situation

286
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
It comes from your foundation

287
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
What does that mean?

288
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
What does that mean?

289
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
We're going to look at four things today

290
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
The four things are

291
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
The cause of peace

292
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
The call to make peace

293
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
The challenge of seeking peace

294
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
in tough times

295
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
and the consequence of peace

296
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,080
What is the cause of peace?

297
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,080
The cause of peace comes from the Lord

298
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
一個神的名字是

299
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
The Lord of Peace

300
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,080
In Judges 6:24

301
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Gideon calls him the Lord of Peace

302
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,080
耶穌的一個名字是

303
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
The Prince of Peace

304
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
For to us a child is born

305
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
To us a son is given

306
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
His name is Wonderful Counselor

307
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Mighty God, Everlasting Father

308
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
The Prince of Peace

309
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
耶穌的名字是

310
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
The Prince of Peace

311
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
平安在哪裏來的?

312
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
真正的平安在天府

313
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
在耶穌那裏

314
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
耶穌說

315
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
保羅說

316
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,080
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and peace

317
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Peace comes from the Holy Spirit

318
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,080
It is a product of relying on the Holy Spirit

319
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Peace comes from the Lord

320
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
and is given by the Lord

321
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,080
He is the cause for peace

322
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
He is the cause for peace

323
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
我記得我有一次

324
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
去菲律賓

325
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
誰去過菲律賓?

326
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
誰去過菲律賓?

327
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Anybody been to the Philippines?

328
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Nobody? Just one person?

329
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Two people?

330
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
So we were on a mission trip

331
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,080
This was our mission trip

332
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
As you see in the next slide

333
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
We were on a mission trip

334
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,080
And we went as a group

335
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,080
And we had to transit

336
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
In Manila

337
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Who's been to Manila?

338
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Who's been to Manila?

339
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
You guys don't like the Philippines?

340
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Central?

341
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Central?

342
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Ok

343
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Ok

344
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
So we had to transport

345
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
a transit in the Philippines

346
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
And what happened was

347
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
You had to go through customs once again

348
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
You had to go through customs once again

349
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
We lined up

350
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
We lined up

351
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
to customs

352
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
We were in a group

353
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
We had 7 people in our team

354
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
We were in a group

355
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
And a guy said

356
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Oh no

357
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
What do you think happened?

358
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Oh no

359
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
He left his passport

360
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
On the plane

361
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Has anyone left their passport on the plane?

362
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Has anyone left their passport on the plane?

363
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Rita?

364
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Wow

365
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Wow

366
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Passport

367
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Wow

368
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Where did you leave it?

369
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Where did you leave it?

370
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Vancouver

371
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Wow

372
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
So where did this guy

373
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
So where did this guy

374
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Leave his passport?

375
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
In the front seat

376
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Rita, you too?

377
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Wow

378
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
He left his passport

379
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
He left his passport

380
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Next time

381
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
When you fly

382
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Put your passport in your wallet

383
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Or in your bag

384
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Don't put it in the front

385
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Big mistake

386
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Oh no

387
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
We have one hour left

388
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
We have to fly

389
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
What should we do?

390
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
We were thinking

391
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Our whole team

392
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
We were thinking

393
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
We were thinking

394
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
We were waiting for our passports

395
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
We were sitting in the

396
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,080
Lost and found office

397
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Rita, did you sit in the lost and found office?

398
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
No?

399
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Oh wow

400
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
We were sitting in the

401
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Lost and found office

402
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
We were thinking

403
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
We have a flight, it's in an hour

404
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Can you help us get our passports

405
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
In the front seat

406
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
In the front seat

407
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
We were waiting

408
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
20 minutes

409
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Till our next flight

410
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
And then half an hour to our next flight

411
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
And then 20 minutes

412
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Oh no, he comes

413
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
We immediately got our passports

414
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
And went to customs

415
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Pass through customs

416
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
We ran to our flight

417
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
And we made it back in time

418
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
In that time

419
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
We could blame this guy

420
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
We could be very annoyed

421
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
We could blame this guy

422
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
We could be very annoyed

423
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
But in that moment

424
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
I trusted that God was in control

425
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
It's okay

426
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
That he left his passport

427
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
We can just stay

428
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
Another couple days in Manila

429
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
We can just wait for it

430
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
At customs

431
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Or we can wait for our next flight

432
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
It's okay

433
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Because we know that the cause of peace

434
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Peace comes from God

435
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
True peace comes from

436
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Knowing God is control

437
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
It requires faith

438
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Not only is Jesus the cause for faith

439
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
He calls us to make peace

440
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Not only is Jesus the cause for peace

441
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
He calls us to make peace

442
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,080
He says, "Blessed are the peacemakers

443
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,080
For they will be called the children of God"

444
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Blessed are the peacemakers

445
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
For they will be called the children of God

446
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Paul also says

447
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Finally, brothers, aim for peace

448
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Comfort one another

449
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Agree with one another

450
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Live in peace

451
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
And the love and peace of God

452
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Will be with you

453
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,080
How do we make peace?

454
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
How do we make peace?

455
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Jesus is the ultimate example of making peace

456
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
How did he make peace?

457
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Let's read in Ephesians chapter 2

458
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
How Jesus made peace

459
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
我們一起讀

460
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
一起讀

461
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Ready?

462
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
One, two, three

463
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,080
For he, Christ himself, is our peace

464
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Who has made us both Jews and Gentiles one

465
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
And has broken down in his flesh

466
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,080
The dividing wall of hostility

467
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,080
By abolishing the law of commandments

468
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Expressed in ordinances

469
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
That he might create in himself

470
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,080
One new man in place of two

471
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
So making peace

472
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,080
Jesus first made peace

473
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,080
是什麼關係沒有平安?

474
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
是我們和誰?

475
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
和神的關係沒有平安

476
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
為什麼?因為我們有

477
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
有罪

478
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Because of sin

479
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
罪的緣故

480
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
我們和神沒有平安

481
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
所以神就要怎樣?

482
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,080
差遣耶穌去做平安

483
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,080
所以神就做了平安

484
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
透過傳送耶穌

485
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
平安是購買的

486
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
是個人的

487
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
是購買在了耶穌的身上

488
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,080
神和我們建立了關係

489
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
所以首先

490
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
神和我們建立了平安

491
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,080
不僅是神和我們建立了平安

492
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,080
他也和我們建立了平安

493
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,080
他和我們建立了平安

494
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,080
因為耶穌死了

495
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
我們不再是猶太人和猶太人

496
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,080
我們是耶穌的一體

497
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,080
之前猶太人覺得他們是保證人

498
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
他們有法律

499
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,080
他們有神的祝福

500
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
而猶太人沒有

501
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,080
我們是保證人

502
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
但是耶穌為我們死的時候

503
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
他連接了我們

504
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
猶太人和猶太人

505
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,080
現在我們是耶穌的一體

506
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
透過信仰

507
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,080
耶穌也叫我們和別人做平安

508
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,080
誰去過台灣?

509
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
台灣

510
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
你會看到在下一個圖片

511
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,080
有一次我們去台灣的行程

512
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,080
我們在說行程的主題

513
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Mavis去日本

514
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
我剛才說了菲律賓

515
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
現在我們說台灣

516
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
去台灣

517
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
我們有三個群體

518
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,080
第一個群體是很活力的

519
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
去做事

520
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
去傳福音

521
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
去幫人

522
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
去和人聊天

523
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
約新人

524
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
有些是很正常的

525
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
很輕鬆

526
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
但還有一個群體是怎樣的?

527
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
覺得很累

528
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
經常遲到

529
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,080
我有一點點病

530
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
我晚上沒有睡覺

531
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,080
我五點好像填胸圈才睡

532
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
是嗎?

533
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
所以怎樣?

534
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
我們做短訊

535
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
一個群體

536
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
就會有什麼?

537
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
有衝突

538
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
是嗎?

539
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
一個群體經常準備好

540
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,080
一個群體經常遲到

541
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
一個群體就說很累

542
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
可不可以休息一下?

543
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,080
可不可以去玩?

544
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
是嗎?

545
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
所以我們要怎樣?

546
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
做和平

547
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,080
去解決這些衝突

548
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
去成為一個群體

549
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
是,做和平

550
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,080
神想我們和祂和其他人和平

551
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,080
最後會說什麼關係?

552
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,080
是和我們自己

553
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:47,080
神會教導那些祂愛的人

554
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
當祂教導我們

555
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
就不愉快

556
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
是嗎?

557
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,080
誰喜歡被父母罵?

558
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,080
誰喜歡被父母罵?

559
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
是嗎?

560
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
說真的嗎?

561
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
誰喜歡被父母罵?

562
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
為什麼他們罵我們?

563
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
你哥哥喜歡

564
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
我知道你哥哥喜歡

565
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
罵多一點好一點

566
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,080
誰喜歡被父母罵?

567
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
不喜歡的

568
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
為什麼他們罵我們?

569
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
因為他們為我們什麼?

570
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,080
為我們好

571
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,080
可能那一刻我們不相信是好的

572
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
是嗎?

573
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
但最後我們看到

574
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
OK,應該是好的

575
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
應該早點睡

576
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
應該是收拾我們的房間

577
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
應該是不要吃那麼多糖

578
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
是嗎?

579
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
但在這個過程中

580
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
被教導

581
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
是很難的

582
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,080
它說

583
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
因此,如果有任何人在耶穌身上

584
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
祂就是新的創造

585
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
老的已經過世

586
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,080
新的已經出現

587
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
當耶穌讓我們新

588
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
需要執行

589
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,080
需要這個過程

590
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
這個過程

591
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,080
我們要接受自己的弱點

592
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
軟弱

593
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
接受我們自己有不同的試探

594
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
挑釁

595
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,080
我們需要和自己和平

596
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,080
特別是在艱難的時刻

597
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,080
我們要找到和平

598
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
我們一起讀

599
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,080
John 16

600
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
我們一起讀

601
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
一起讀

602
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
1,2,3

603
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,080
我對你們說了這些話

604
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,080
在我身上你們可能有和平

605
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,080
在世界上你們可能有懲罰

606
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
但請記住

607
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
我已經克服了世界

608
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
耶穌說什麼?

609
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,080
我們這個世界會有什麼?

610
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
懲罰

611
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,080
會有困難

612
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
會有不同的

613
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
可能是身體上的挑戰

614
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
可能我們有病

615
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
受傷了

616
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,080
可能我們有心理上的挑戰

617
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
可能是抑鬱

618
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
可能是心理上的挑戰

619
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,080
可能我們和人的關係有挑戰

620
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,080
可能是世界有不同的挑戰

621
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
但耶穌說

622
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,080
祂給我們和平

623
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
祂給我們和平

624
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,080
因為祂已經克服了世界

625
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,080
我記得有一次

626
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
在夏天的時候

627
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
我撐著艇

628
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
在香港有誰曾經開過海盜艇?

629
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
有,很棒

630
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
你們可以看到

631
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,080
海盜艇和海灘的這張圖片

632
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,080
我開海盜艇的時候

633
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
在一個營裡

634
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,080
我和小朋友一起開海盜艇的時候

635
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
他就有一個想法

636
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
這個想法是什麼呢?

637
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
我們反船

638
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Pastor Johnny的船

639
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
反船

640
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,080
最後他們六七個

641
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
就反船了

642
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,080
我的電話是一個水證件

643
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
但這個水證件

644
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
吊在我的頸上

645
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
我就把它脫掉

646
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
因為海盜艇的時候

647
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,080
這個風就會很大

648
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
很煩

649
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
我就把它脫掉

650
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,080
他反船的時候

651
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
我的電話就

652
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,080
升了下去

653
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
我們在梅窩

654
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
有沒有人去過梅窩?

655
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
水清不清?

656
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,080
是最不清的

657
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
最不清的

658
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
OK?

659
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
是最濕的水

660
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,080
不知道有什麼水池

661
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
一反船

662
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,080
你掌握著空氣

663
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
你的海盜艇就被翻轉了

664
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
你只是想拿空氣

665
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
然後

666
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,080
我的電話不是在浮動

667
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
是在滲水

668
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
我就說糟糕了

669
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
電話沒了

670
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
然後波浪又很大

671
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
我們就開始浮來浮去

672
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
潛下去就看不到東西

673
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
又不知道潛到

674
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,080
電話的最初位置

675
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,080
不知道在哪裡

676
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
在這個情況下

677
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
可以怪責小朋友

678
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
為什麼小朋友翻我的海盜艇

679
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
可以怪責我自己

680
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,080
為什麼不馬上拿著我的電話

681
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
可以怪責神

682
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
神啊

683
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,080
為什麼我在這裡的營裡去侍奉

684
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,080
但是有這個情況發生

685
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
為什麼

686
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,080
我可以做很多事情

687
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,080
但我接受了這個情況

688
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,080
我接受了神有更好的計劃

689
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
祂不想我那週末

690
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
拿著電話

691
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
我把我的安慰

692
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
我的信任

693
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
交給了神

694
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,080
祂會照顧我

695
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
我每次的約會

696
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
祂會照顧我

697
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
我每次的擔憂

698
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
我會有安慰

699
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,080
後來有人付了我新的電話

700
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
哇

701
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
有人付了我新的電話

702
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
所以神給了我

703
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
神給了我

704
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
我不是說如果你丟掉電話

705
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,080
神會給你新的電話

706
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
然後有人會付錢給你

707
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
我不知道阿姨Winnie

708
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
或者阿姨Rita會不會付錢給你

709
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
她可能不會

710
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,080
但是我說

711
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
如果你相信神

712
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
總有一天

713
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
事情會變好

714
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
你會有安慰

715
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
讓我們來評論

716
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
神想我們和祂有安慰

717
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,080
這是一個上升的關係

718
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
神想我們和其他人有安慰

719
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
這是一個上升的關係

720
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,080
神想我們和自己有安慰

721
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,080
特別是在艱難的時刻

722
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,080
但是如果你和神的關係沒有安慰

723
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,080
這會影響你所有的關係

724
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,080
如果你和神的關係沒有真正的平安

725
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:28,080
你所有的關係都會受到影響

726
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,080
和平不是來自你的情況

727
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,080
而是來自你的基礎

728
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,080
你的基礎必須是神

729
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
我們如何能夠有安慰

730
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
在艱難的時刻

731
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,080
我們必須確保我們的基礎堅強

732
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
耶穌說

733
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,080
不要在沙上建造你的房子

734
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,080
建造在石頭上

735
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
因為如果建造在沙上

736
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,080
如果你看到最後一張照片

737
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,080
那是一個石頭上的房子

738
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
如果這個房子在沙上

739
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,080
會發生什麼事

740
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
會發生什麼事

741
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
會發生什麼事

742
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,080
如果這個房子在沙上

743
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,080
在最後一刻會發生什麼事

744
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,080
這個房子會進入海洋

745
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,080
會進入海洋

746
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,080
耶穌告訴我們要建造我們的房子在石頭上

747
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
我們要找到我們的平安

748
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,080
在一個堅強的基礎上

749
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
我會邀請樂隊上台

750
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,080
我們要閉上眼睛

751
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,080
我們要想想

752
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,080
基礎是什麼

753
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,080
我們閉上眼睛

754
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
現在是你和神之間

755
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
基礎是什麼

756
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,080
你的平安基礎是什麼

757
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,080
是你的等級嗎

758
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
因為如果你的等級高了

759
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
你會有平安

760
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
如果你的等級低了

761
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,080
你不會有平安

762
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,080
你會有多少人喜歡你

763
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
或者追蹤你

764
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
在Instagram上

765
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,080
因為人們會來

766
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,080
人們會走

767
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,080
如果我們建立我們的基礎

768
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
我們的平安

769
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,080
在不堪一擊的事情上

770
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,080
我們永遠都會上下走

771
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:39,080
如果我們把平安放在永恆上

772
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,080
神永不變

773
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
祂愛我們

774
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,080
祂稱呼我們為和平的建築

775
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,080
祂就是我們的平安

776
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
我們就真的會有平安

777
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,080
我不知道你們在過什麼

778
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,080
我們在2022年結束後

779
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
開始新的一年

780
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
你們可能會有很多擔憂

781
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
可能會有考試

782
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080

783

可能會有朋友關係

784
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080

786
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
在找到平安的時候

787
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
我今天要挑戰你們

788
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
在找到平安的時候

789
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
在找到平安的時候

790
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
因為祂在乎你們

791
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
祂愛你們

792
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
祂愛你們這麼多

793
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
祂在你們身上死了

794
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
祂愛你們

795
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,080
祂想讓你們有平安

796
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,080
祂想讓你們有平安

797
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,080
祂不想讓你們依賴自己或別人

798
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,080
祂想讓你們依賴祂

799
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
祂想讓你們有平安

800
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,080
你們會相信祂嗎?

801
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,080
將你的信念放在祂身上

802
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,080
讓祂成為你們的平安

803
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,080
是世界無法給予的平安

804
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,080
讓我們祈禱

805
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080

禰叫我們和禰和其他人和自己

813
