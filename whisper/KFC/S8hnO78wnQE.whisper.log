[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Hi Church and Happy New Year!
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.120]   I'm deeply sorry that you have to have another instalment from me on video.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.840]   I was convinced that I needed to bring this word personally and was genuinely expecting
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.480]   to be back home in Hong Kong.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.400]   But Sandra's dad's funeral is now not until next Tuesday and we hope to be flying back
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:45.480]   next Saturday and we will be back with you in person the week after.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.800]   I can't wait.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.280]   Let me do a recap.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:02.960]   On January 7th I set the scene, as it were, for our 2023 theme, Equipping the Saints,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.400]   Serving the Community.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:15.320]   And I talked about us to you to them.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.960]   And I don't know about you but I was so blessed to hear both Dr Seth Kim and then our own
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:33.720]   Pastor Johnny talk powerfully about being firstly together and then about being prepared,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.640]   opening the way for me to talk about being equipped today.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.920]   Their sermons are the entry points, the admission tickets, as it were, for tonight's talk.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.280]   I will be covering the passage, Ephesians 4, 11 to 16, that Bonnie so beautifully read
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.800]   for us earlier.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   This passage is our template for equipping.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.480]   And it starts in verse 11 with God giving.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480]   This is important.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.600]   We do well to remember this.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.880]   It always starts with God giving.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.360]   No apostle, prophet, evangelist or pastor teacher can say that it is anything of their
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.760]   own making.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:55.260]   And the overall message here is that God gives so that the saints, that's you and me, may
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:08.920]   be equipped so that the body of Christ grows and is built up.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.680]   What I plan to do this evening is a verse by verse teaching.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.800]   I'll be taking these six verses in two halves.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.280]   I'll call them part one and part two.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.680]   You may remember that three weeks ago I said that Christ's plan A for the world is the
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.960]   church.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.000]   He doesn't have a plan B.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.800]   And for my first half, part one this evening, I want to look at the way that Christ has
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.640]   distributed his spiritual gifts to his people.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:08.360]   I'll call them the how, the why and the where.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.600]   I'll be looking at how, the means that God enables his people.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.320]   Verse 11.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.440]   The why, the purpose that God has for his people in verse 12.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.080]   And the where, the goal that God has for his people.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.000]   Let's look at them one at a time.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.600]   Firstly how, the means that God enables his people.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   Let's read.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:48.760]   And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.160]   The first thing that is mentioned is how God, through Christ, has made it possible for all
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.800]   of his people to receive the truth they need to live right and good lives.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   God gave certain gifts and associated them with certain key offices in the church.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.040]   These men and ladies are not called leaders here, but certainly play their influential
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.240]   part.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   There are four categories, although some suggest five.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.480]   Apostles, prophets, evangelists and pastor teachers.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:49.120]   Christ equips these certain persons with gifts and positions to train, equip and protect
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.120]   the sheep.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.160]   Let's first discuss what each of these gifts to the church might mean and then come back
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.040]   to how it relates to our own church.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.120]   Firstly, the term apostle means sent one.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.800]   We can best understand the apostle's special designation as a church starter, or in today's
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.080]   terms we call them a church planter.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.060]   These individuals go into uncharted territories and establish the church of God.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.280]   They define the basic truths of the gospel, who Christ is, how a person is saved and what
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.040]   the gospel is, and so on.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:41.380]   The prophet takes what God has given to him and reveals it to God's people.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.680]   God is communing with the people.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.960]   This can be foretelling, but is generally forth telling, speaking the word of God for
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.800]   now to the people.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   In many people's minds, the evangelist is the person who speaks and charms thousands
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.700]   down to the front of the auditorium during an oracle.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.440]   This disguises the real meaning of the evangelist.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.220]   It again is not his charm or winsome personality, but the spirit of God working through the
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:31.560]   evangelist's message that releases the gospel into the hearts of men so the spirit of God
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.440]   can use it to convert the souls he is working in.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:45.480]   Let's speak about Pastor Teacher, the ESV actually calls it Shepherd Teacher.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.640]   It's generally regarded as one position, but we could equally have argued that it's two.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:59.720]   Either way, we cannot dogmatically use our conclusions to define our ministries.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:06.000]   A pastor cares for a local group of God's people, sometimes more.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.080]   He or she has a narrow focus.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.360]   The apostle may focus on a regent.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.120]   The prophet focuses on the relevant target, whether it be a group or individual.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.640]   And the evangelist, of course, focuses on the unreached.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:32.080]   The pastor teacher sets his heart on training the people in his own congregation.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:39.040]   The conclusion to verse 11 is that God will be calling and raising leaders from among
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.480]   our congregations to these positions.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.640]   My question is, are you one of them?
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.520]   If we start opening our eyes in faith to the God who is serious about equipping the church,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.920]   then he indeed will bless us.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.040]   We must not succumb to the doubt that we don't need these gifted individuals.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:14.120]   May God all the more equip us like the New Testament church.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.080]   God is serious about training his people.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.240]   We need to get with it and start recognising those he has gifted around us.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.520]   Otherwise we will never get where God wants to take us.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:38.600]   And that, dear church, is how, the means that God enables his people.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:47.560]   We now need to understand why God gave such gifts to his church.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:55.920]   He is very purposed in his provision of these instructors.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.680]   Verse 12, this is why.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:09.400]   To equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.680]   Now I spoke at length about this verse three weeks ago and do not intend repeating myself,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:22.120]   but suffice to say this one small verse clearly maps out God's design for the church.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.080]   He enables the church to reflect his love and truth in the world.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:38.720]   It embodies everything that we at Gong Fook Church are looking to in 2023 and beyond.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.760]   As we awaken to the glorious and most gracious calling for the church to serve him, we are
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:54.560]   all the more moved at the love and grace of God towards our own lives.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.760]   For instead of growing in pride, we are humbled that God would work in our lives, yes even
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.400]   us, in such wonderful fashion.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.800]   The world today is in desperate need for a church that is operating in the way that God
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:22.600]   envisaged when the church of Christ was born and the spirit lit the flame as we sang.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:35.880]   For us, equipping the saints is not a catchphrase, but a necessity given the state of the worldwide
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.240]   church in 2023.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:46.760]   I was reading a quote this week from famous explorer Bear Grylls.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:55.120]   He said this, "I think Jesus would struggle with 99% of churches nowadays."
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.220]   Sad, eh?
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.680]   People are wondering if the church has any meaning.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.720]   Many do not see God's love in the church.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.200]   The church wonders if it has anything to offer and when the church is confused, it begins
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.600]   to act just like the world.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:30.080]   This might be the way the church is in many cases, but it does not need to remain there.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:39.440]   What equipping the saints, serving the community is about is when the people of God catch the
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:48.040]   truth and love of God as shown in his great plan for the people of God, she wakes up the
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.440]   call and the opportunity for God's church.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:59.920]   And that is the why, the purpose that God has for his people.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.800]   But let's look at where we are going, the goal that God has for his people.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:19.920]   And it's in verse 13, "Until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:28.800]   of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.000]   Christ."
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.920]   This is getting exciting.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:39.080]   We gain a much better understanding of how the whole picture looks here in Ephesians
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.560]   4.13.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.440]   We find that Christ has a purpose in mind when he gives gifts to his church.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:57.280]   In verse 11 we saw that God gives us preachers, apostles, pastor teachers, prophets.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.560]   But if these instructors are not rightly living out their calling, then the church will be
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.400]   weak.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   If the pastor, for example, believes the church can grow because he is a good administrator
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.120]   or even a winsome preacher, then he will ultimately fail.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:27.000]   It's true he might be able to grow, even grow a big congregation, but he will not have Christ's
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   fullness.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.640]   When these equipers focus on what they feel is right and on their natural talent, they
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.360]   tend to ignore what God has appointed them to do.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:46.320]   We must return to God's way of doing things.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.280]   God has appointed to bring grace to the church through the right functioning of apostles,
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.960]   evangelists, prophets and pastor teachers.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:02.520]   Our goal is not just to get people into church, but to teach them so that they themselves
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.560]   can serve the community.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:17.600]   All of us need to know the word of God and how to use it to minister our own gifts.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:27.320]   By growing the people, the numbers of people able to serve and minister, we begin together
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.120]   to overwhelm the forces of darkness.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.520]   Satan would have a hard time holding back the word of God.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:46.760]   This is why equipping, equipping is so important.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   The problem here is not that society is too dark and evil, but only there is not enough
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.400]   light.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:06.360]   The church can awaken and be the instrument that God uses to change the community.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.680]   All the church needs has been given.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.280]   The problem is we just don't believe it.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:19.400]   Many Christians have lost hope by the sad things that they have seen happen amongst
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.120]   the people of God.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.640]   They think that such a grand picture of the church is for some sort of distant heaven.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.440]   The apostle, however, does not give us this picture at all.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   Paul is talking about now.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.240]   The time for transformation is now.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.760]   We have totally missed it if we think it is for another day.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.400]   In this case, our goal might just be to get by.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   To do church.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:56.800]   Rather than, as it says here in verse 13, to grow.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.320]   To grow in the fullness of Christ.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.240]   Now we might be able to criticise the church for not doing this or not being that, but
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:12.080]   we need to come back to our own lives.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:19.840]   We can ask ourselves, are we, are we, am I truly seeking these three things?
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.400]   In verse 13, for our own lives.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.200]   Let's look at them one at a time.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.720]   Firstly, Paul said to attain to the unity of the faith.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:38.160]   If I am seeking the unity of the faith, then I myself will live by faith.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:45.280]   As Dr Seth told us, I will love others because they are God's people.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.840]   Even if I don't get along with them as well.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:56.120]   I will seek God to teach me all the truth that I need to know that I can rightfully
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.920]   carry out my work of ministry.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.480]   Faith is always unifying.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:10.520]   Because it constantly calls us to go beyond our own way of treating others and to care
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.600]   for others as Christ would.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.680]   And next Paul talked about attaining to the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:27.600]   If I am seeking the knowledge of the Son of God, then all other goals in my life will
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.140]   become by comparison unattractive.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:43.240]   What once occupied my mind and heart is now gone because I have tasted the love of God.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.960]   Nothing compares with Christ.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.520]   We want more of Christ rather than less.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.960]   Away with church politics, infighting, jealousies.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.960]   We just want Christ.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:07.040]   And lastly Paul said we attain to mature manhood to the measure of the stature of the fullness
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.840]   of Christ.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:17.360]   If I am to be a mature man, and yes this of course includes you ladies, if I am to
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:24.320]   be a mature man through which Christ fully lives, I need to focus on my growth which
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:31.120]   fosters humility rather than my past experience which fosters pride.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:38.480]   We want Christ to be known through our lives rather than us being known.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.440]   We desire God's love to radiate to others through our lives.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   But the question I keep asking myself, why?
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.920]   Why doesn't the church look like this?
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:01.320]   And we will see the answers for this in the next section, the second half on Ephesians
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.680]   14-16.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.800]   Paul will be telling the church three things.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.720]   Number one, don't be deceived.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.440]   Secondly, speak the truth in love.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.960]   And thirdly, grow up.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.880]   Let's look at them one at a time.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.640]   Firstly, don't be deceived.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:34.720]   Ephesians 14, so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:42.600]   carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.760]   schemes.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.360]   You know, the biggest problem with the church is she doesn't think she is deceived.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.840]   And if we don't know the problem, then we are most likely infected with the virus, yeah
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.440]   that word again, which results in our deception.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:10.800]   I want to draw to your attention four serious flaws that have resulted in big problems for
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.440]   the church.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:21.160]   Firstly, professionalism allows the notion that certain members should and do the majority
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.320]   of church work.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:28.560]   I'll leave it to the pastors, after all, my tithes pay their salaries.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:35.720]   Because of this, the people are not mobilised, and much of the work of the ministry is neglected.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:41.280]   People do not expect to be trained because they do not see themselves as the workers.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:48.680]   They tend to think they are better off when the worship service is short and entertaining
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.520]   rather than long and instructive.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:59.760]   Their Christianity can be summarised by one church service that they attend each week.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.000]   The second serious flaw is individualism.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.080]   Individualism wrongly teaches that the expression of our own thoughts and ideas is most important
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.320]   to our life and fulfilment.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:22.640]   These individuals will focus on meeting their own felt needs rather than the needs of others.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.920]   This happens when a pastor seeks the approval of the congregation rather than the training
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.200]   of others.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:37.080]   This also results when the congregation do works for the Lord in their own flesh.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:43.840]   One observation I have is how little churches seem to pray these days.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.800]   Carelessness reveals self-confidence rather than faith in the Lord.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.320]   We need to build each other up so that we can do God's work together.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.600]   The third serious flaw is what I would call religiosity.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:07.280]   Religiosity teaches that a person can be a good Christian by attending this function or
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.720]   that function.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:16.840]   Associated problems are the great number of people that see church attendance as the only
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.920]   thing expected from them.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.240]   They are uncommitted.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.360]   The fourth serious flaw is what I would call spirituality.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:35.280]   Spirituality teaches that one's spiritual life consists in inward, otherworldly notions
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:44.160]   and feelings which breeds arrogance and despises rules, authority and interdependence.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:52.560]   On the other hand, true spirituality causes a true desire to constantly grow to be more
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.880]   like Christ.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:00.120]   It causes oneself to be closely involved in the growth of other Christians and it causes
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:06.800]   the balance of truth and love worked out in the relationship with others.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:19.960]   It causes a commitment to learn and observe God's truth as taught in his word.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:28.000]   The church has a lot of problems because Satan has duped her.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.080]   She doesn't really know what is right.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.960]   Without this persistent training that God provides us through the instructors he has
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:42.280]   given his church, Christians will stumble and fall.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:48.960]   God has given us the key to growing strong godly people.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:59.200]   We need to be aggressive in training them to equip the saints.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.720]   Secondly he talks about speaking the truth in love.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   Verse 15.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.200]   "Rather speaking the truth in love."
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.720]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.600]   Is the truth more important than love?
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:21.040]   Or is the love more important than truth?
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:27.920]   If you can answer yes to either question, then you are off balance.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.960]   Truth is love and love is truth.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.440]   Drop one and you lose both.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.500]   Gain one and the other will come.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:44.280]   We must not compromise on what the apostle says is important for the church to carry
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.120]   out her mission.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.440]   We need to speak the truth in love.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.520]   Our goal and means are clearly laid out here.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.600]   The goal is to become more like Christ our head.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.800]   The means is simply to lovingly proclaim and live out the truth.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:12.280]   Both of these elements, truth and love, are not to be compromised in any way.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.480]   They are both essential to the glory of Christ.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:25.360]   John 1.14 tells us, "And the word," that's Jesus, "became flesh and dwelt among us, and
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.520]   we have seen his glory.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:38.080]   Glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:44.480]   What I found is the church often swings from one extreme to the other.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.200]   The needed balance was beautifully worked out in Christ.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.240]   The challenge for us is to live it out.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.020]   We must speak the truth in love.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.080]   We speak the uncomfortable truth because people need to hear it.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:08.360]   We speak lovingly because it is the only way to speak the truth.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:14.240]   Otherwise, we misrepresent the truth.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:22.200]   Churches need to instruct their people on how to both speak the truth in love as well
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.300]   as how to make Christ the goal in life.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:34.480]   We must refuse to compromise the truth in the name of love.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.520]   Paul's last call is simple.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.080]   It is two words.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.960]   Grow up.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:49.720]   We are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.600]   Note the fact we are to grow up in all aspects.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.400]   To be honest, it will take a lifetime, but why stop?
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.240]   Let us reflect on growth by examining a number of questions.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:08.540]   Firstly, how come some Christians don't think they need to grow?
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:14.840]   The biggest problem of the church is that she does not think she needs to grow.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:20.480]   Once a person knows he or she is a Christian and guaranteed a seat in heaven, they lose
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.820]   interest in the things of God.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:28.280]   This is largely because the church has not done a good job of training, of equipping
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.040]   the church.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.480]   Very few churches implement discipleship.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:43.040]   Christians think they know what they need, when in fact all they know is the means by
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.840]   which they can learn more.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.520]   How are Christians to grow?
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.400]   God has revealed the whole growth process in Ephesians 4.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:03.280]   The church can only grow if she rightly receives the word of God, the Bible.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:10.800]   Each of the main conduits through which the truth enters the church is an instructor of
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.720]   truth.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:18.680]   Growth is inextricably related to acquiring a love for the truth.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.200]   We learn the truth and obey it.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:28.280]   Growth then means a person is more like Christ in his attitudes, his treatment of others,
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.920]   and his belief in God.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.240]   And lastly, how are we to measure our growth?
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.680]   Many Christians live aimlessly in this world.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.760]   They have no goals, no instruction, no motivation.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:48.280]   A Christian that is growing will find sweeter and sweeter times with the Lord.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:55.080]   Better relationships with others and a feeling of deeper personal fulfilment.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:02.240]   This does not mean things will go easy for him or her, but only that they have the peace
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.080]   of heart about the Lord taking care of his situation.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.240]   So our solution is simple enough.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.120]   Number one, do not be deceived by the world.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.800]   Number two, speak the truth in love.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.960]   And number three, keep growing like Christ.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.920]   But I'm not done yet.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.760]   I won't be long.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:37.960]   The apostle has given us a special illustration that ties everything together.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.320]   And it is verse 16.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.480]   Now let's read it together.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.760]   I know I'm in the UK and you're in Hong Kong, but we can read it together.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:55.560]   1 2 3 From whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:03.160]   is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.280]   up in love.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:12.400]   From this verse we can see how the body should rightly grow.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.720]   I'm going to make some observations.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.840]   I want to take it phrase by phrase.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:21.480]   Firstly, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.680]   it is equipped.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.180]   Each person is part of the whole, part of the whole body.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:37.200]   Each person has his own key role to play in the overall development of the whole body.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.520]   No part is to be neglected.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:47.040]   Each is valuable and important to reaching the final goal that God has for us.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.280]   We cannot say or assume that one part is not important.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:32:02.520]   Each part has a place and each part is interdependent, it is held together.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:09.020]   Paul then goes on to say when each part is working properly, we must be diligent to make
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.960]   each part properly function.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:19.560]   A part might be in the right place, but if it is not functional, it still can't rightly
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.620]   help others.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:28.520]   We all need to be diligent in not just having people come to church, but they are effectively
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:34.940]   trained, equipped, so that they can rightfully serve.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.400]   No training means no proper working.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.900]   Lets move on.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.480]   Makes the body grow so that it builds itself up.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:53.640]   When the individual body parts are rightfully functioning, then the whole body grows.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.960]   We are on the whole far too individualistic.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.600]   We think about our own growth, rather than the whole body's growth.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:11.880]   Have you ever prayed, "Lord help me grow so that everyone will be benefited"?
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.060]   Probably not.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:19.240]   And lastly, these two words, in love.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:25.360]   Growth is inextricably linked, related to love.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.080]   Love is the definitive summary of growth.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.800]   Love captures everything that is supposed to happen.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.080]   Love is the life of God being poured into our lives.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.320]   Love is the connecting glue that keeps us together.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:47.280]   Love brings about smooth interfunctioning, much like oil.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:56.280]   Love is the joy and desire to continuing functioning together in the future.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:04.200]   Love has to be the motivation for us to equip the saints.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:14.360]   Love also has to be the motivation for us to serve the community.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   Can I hear Amen?
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   Amen.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:29.600]   I am so excited that next week, Pastor John is going to be giving us a how-to, on equipping
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.320]   and how to share the gospel with others.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:39.960]   And the week after, Pastor James is going to give us a how-to, a how to present the
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.280]   Word of God.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.760]   I would love to pray for us now.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.200]   And if I could just pray as the band comes up.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:58.520]   Father, I thank you for your provision for us, for all that you've provided for us as
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.960]   a church.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.640]   I pray now that you'd fill us once again with your Holy Spirit.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.160]   In particular, Lord, that you'd allow us to speak the truth in love.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:18.760]   Lord, I pray your love would shower upon us as a congregation, so that we would take your
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:26.040]   love out to a world and a community that needs it so desperately.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.040]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.620]   Amen.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.440]   Thank you guys and I'll see you in two weeks.
