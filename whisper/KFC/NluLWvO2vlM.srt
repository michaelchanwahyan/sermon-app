1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Testing, testing.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Hello everyone, welcome to church.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I hope you have your mask on.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 I'm victorious part two.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 I'm victorious part two.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Clapping]

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hello everyone, it's good to be able to see you all. As you can see, my family and I, we are going crazy here.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Cabin fever is for real and no doubt it's the same for you.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But my prayer is that you guys are all safe and healthy and still able to really connect with God and brothers and sisters during this time.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 So it's a joy to be able to bring you the word today.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Last week I started I am Victorious part one.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And it finishes off the series in Ephesians talking about identity.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And we focus on Ephesians 6, the whole armour of God.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And I spoke about three things, the battle, the enemy and the victory.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 The battle that started from the moment the serpent deceived Eve.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And the battle that continues for souls that has been happening before the protests, after the virus was long gone.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 The battle for souls continues until Christ returns.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Against who? The enemy.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 The enemy who is powerful but also vulnerable.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Who doesn't have control over us.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And ultimately the victory.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 The victory that is confirmed already that we just have to be prepared for and to continue to follow God's calling as we wait for Christ to return.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And this week I'm going to be focusing on the separate parts of the armour of God.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Now each of these six parts in themselves could be a sermon.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 This could be a sermon series in itself.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 But my intention isn't to unpack each of those to too much of a detail.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 But rather for me these six different parts of the armour of God represent six different battlegrounds that I think we are facing in society today.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And to link that back to I Am Victorious is how can we choose victory in each of these battlegrounds.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So I'm going to be going through each one of these for you.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Let me read to you the word of God.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Ephesians chapter 6 verse 14.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and as shoes for your feet having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 In all circumstances take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Praying at all times in the spirit with all prayer and supplication.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 This is the word of the Lord.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So six pieces of armour.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's very interesting as we unpack these different types, these different parts and how these relate to us in the battlegrounds that we face.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 The first one is this.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 The belt of truth.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Verse 14.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And the battleground that this one represents for me is the battle between truth and lies.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 You see it's funny in this day and age where technology is everywhere.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 We have information at our fingertips.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And yet even though we have all this information somehow what's emerged most is not information but misinformation, disinformation.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 There's news and then there's fake news.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 So somehow even though we have so much technology, so much surveillance, so much accountability, the truth is still hard to find.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And what scripture is telling us here is truth is so, so important.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Later on in the very final piece of armour we're going to be talking about truth again.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 But for me here as we look at, as we think about what the belt of truth represents, if we think about what a belt is.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Have you ever left the house and forgotten your belt?

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I have. It's obviously an awkward feeling because the moment you forget your belt, it's a subtle thing.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Sometimes you forget it but by forgetting it, even though it's so small and subtle, it's so important.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And actually the rest of your day is compromised. Your activities are compromised because you're concerned about whether your trousers are going to fall down.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And the belt really aids us in covering up the most intimate part of us, the most deep parts of who we are.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And so what the Apostle Paul is saying, at least to me here, is truth is so, so important that our lives, the foundation of our lives, have to be based on truth.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Especially in this day and age where there's post-modernism and there's post-truth, where what is truth?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Truth is whatever you feel it is, but we as believers base our lives, our foundation on the Word of God as truth.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Because we know that if we don't base our lives on truth, they will just be tossed by the winds and the waves and our lives will have no anchor.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Truth is so, so important in the inmost part of us.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 So this battleground between truth and lies, my question to you is how committed are you to living by the truth?

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 How committed are you in finding the truth?

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 In the midst of all this fake news, all this misinformation that is coming our way every single day through our phones, through our conversations, how concerned are we?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 How committed are we to truth? That is the first piece of armour.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 The second one is this, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 The breastplate was this shield that a soldier would wear that would cover their main torso, their core part of their body.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And this part of course would cover all the vital organs.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Now, we've all been in the cold before, and when it's cold, our body automatically senses that it's cold and needs to limit the losing of heat.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So our fingers will start to lose heat, they will start to become numb, they will start to go blue, because your body recognises the most important parts of the body, the vital organs need the blood the most.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So this part, this area here, the heart, for us, we have to guard this with righteousness.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 We have to choose righteousness over sin.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And that is the second battleground that I think this represents, the battle between righteousness and sin.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Us choosing to live righteous lives, lives that honour God, lives that choose God over the world.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Lives that choose righteousness over sin.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And of course, all of these can be seen in the way that we make decisions.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Every single day we have so many decisions to make, thousands of decisions that we have to make.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Some of them are big. What careers to choose, what spouse to choose, how to raise our children, where to live, where to work.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 But of course there are smaller ones as well. There are smaller ones that are maybe, we don't think are as important, but really are very important.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 You know, in England there's a saying, look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 If we focus on the smaller things, these smaller decisions will then add up to the bigger decisions.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so my question to all of us today, my question to myself, is how concerned am I, how committed to making righteous decisions am I?

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And every day, you know, the Apostle Paul in Romans 7 says, each time I want to do something good, there's an inner part of me that wrestles,

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 that wants for everything I know I should do, I don't do. And the things I don't do, I really should be doing.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So you've got this internal battle that goes on, even for the Apostle Paul.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And I think for us, this battleground between righteousness and sin is so important, down to our very small decisions.

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 These last few months, seeing that we've been at home, we've been watching and we've been listening to a lot of Frozen 2.

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 It's become one of our favourite movies, and better than Frozen 1, you can argue about that yourselves.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And we love the songs. And there's one song in particular that talks, at least to me, talks about this.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And it's sung by a character called Anna, it's called "The Next Right Thing".

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Now, I'm not going to try and spoil the movie for you, but in the movie there's a scene where Anna is distraught.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Things haven't gone as planned, as often in movies there will be a segment of that.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And for her, she was lost, she doesn't know where to go anymore.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 All her hopes had been shattered, and she was just sad and grieving.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And then, as the song goes, Anna just comforts herself and eventually lifts herself up.

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And even though she didn't quite know what the future was going to look like, she knew that she just had to commit to the next right thing.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And that really spoke to Christine and I, because we, since coming to Hong Kong, we've had to make decisions after decisions.

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And just sometimes as adults you just don't know which is the right one.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Some of them are big and some of them are small.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And then we end up just reminding ourselves, just choose the next right thing.

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 What is the next right thing? What is the righteous choice in this next decision?

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 On who to talk to, who to meet, where to take our family, all these small things.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 These small decisions ultimately contribute to who we are.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 So for me, the second battleground between righteousness and sin.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And ultimately we know that righteousness will win over.

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Let's continue.

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Verse 15.

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 "And as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace."

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Have you realised that so far we've had a belt, we've had a breastplate, and now we've got shoes.

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I talked about this last week.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 This battle that Paul talks about isn't quite the same battle that we imagine as people living in this day and age.

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 This isn't talking about invading enemy territory.

113
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 But this is about withstanding. This battle is just different.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And this third one is very interesting. Shoes.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 I mean, I love shoes. In fact, I probably, my Christina would, I guess, say that I have a shoe problem.

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 But I love shoes. I love all types of shoes, mostly basketball shoes.

117
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And one of the things I love about basketball shoes, they are specifically designed to protect and support the type of activity that you're doing.

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 This is interesting here because as Paul talks about shoes for your feet, it's having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Theologians call this the lofty paradox because it's a strange warfare strategy that you would put on shoes to send messengers to talk about peace.

120
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But we're in battle, but somehow we're talking about the good news. We're talking about peace.

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 It's called a lofty paradox. And it's a strange one here.

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 But it again highlights that the battle that we are facing here is not one that we are familiar with if we're just looking at earthly perspectives.

123
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And here, what he's saying is we have to be ones who are carrying the good news around, carrying the gospel of peace to those around us.

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And for me, this part of the armour represents the battleground between good news and bad news.

125
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Every day we are hounded with bad news, just constantly through our conversations, through our phones, social media, the news.

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 It is all bad news. But the gospel tells us, the Bible tells us that we have to combat that by spreading the good news.

127
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 In making people aware that, yes, that the world is bad news, the world is in darkness, that we ourselves have a lot of darkness, but that there is good news.

128
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I think this part, Paul is thinking about Isaiah 52. How beautiful are the feet of those who take the good news around.

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 And as we take the good news, if we wear the right footwear, then we will be protected. We will be supported.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Our duty in the face of bad news is to be committed to spreading good news around.

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 So my question to you is this. How committed to spreading good news are you?

132
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And right now in this day and age, it might simply be to stop spreading bad news.

133
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Whenever we receive WhatsApp messages or news articles that we see have the potential to anger people or worry people,

134
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 maybe it's choosing to not spread the bad news, but rather spread the good news, spread the things that we know are true

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 and the things that will help lift people up and to glorify God. How committed are we in spreading the good news?

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 As we continue, verse 16, "In all circumstances, take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one."

137
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 The shield that Paul is talking about that was used in warfare back then would be these huge door-sized shields

138
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 and they would dip them into water so then, so when the darts would come, when the flaming darts would come,

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 these big shields would extinguish the fires. And what is the shield of? Representing faith.

140
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 See, for me, this armour represents the battleground between hope and hopelessness.

141
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 You see, the word, the Bible uses the word faith and hope interchangeably.

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 It's talking about this hope and faith in being sure, being certain of what is to come.

143
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 This isn't an earthly kind of hope and I've spoken to us about this before at the end of last year.

144
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 This isn't the hope where we, "Oh, we hope the virus stops soon. We hope that the weather will get warmer.

145
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 We hope that people, we hope there'll be toilet roll in welcome." It's not that kind of hope.

146
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But this hope is one where we can say, "Jesus is coming back. He will redeem this world."

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 We hope for the best. Not in the earthly sense, we hope for the best.

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 We have faith that the best is coming, that the best is yet to come because Jesus is returning.

149
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And when we hold that hope, if we hold that shield of faith, so when the enemy throws darts at us,

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 when the schemes come right at us, we can hold the shield of faith up and we can choose hope over hopelessness.

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Linking this back to the one before about spreading good news,

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 there are so many people in this city that are currently just lacking hope,

153
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 that just feel as though their situation is hopeless.

154
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 How committed are we in helping them, getting beside them,

155
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 showing them and reminding them of the hope that we have in Jesus?

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Something interesting about this shield of faith is that the shield that was used back then,

157
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 whilst they would be huge on their own and do quite a good job,

158
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 the Romans would also use them to interlock with each other.

159
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 So you'd have multiple shields all connected with each other.

160
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And then you would form kind of like a big barrier, a corporate protection, if you would say.

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And in some ways that reminds me that faith, we can all hold our own shields,

162
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 but sometimes it just gets tiring when the enemy's darts keep flying at us.

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But if we lock these shields together, if we stand beside each other,

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 then we have a much better chance of defending ourselves,

165
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 a much better chance of withstanding assault.

166
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So how committed are we to protecting ourselves, to maintaining hope?

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 How committed are we in doing this together?

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 To not letting things, events like what's happening now with the virus,

169
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 to not letting them divide us, but for us to say, you know what?

170
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Let us fight this together. Let us commit to each other.

171
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Let us lock shields of faith. That is the one I'm talking about here.

172
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Verse 17, "And take the helmet of salvation."

173
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 This is an interesting one. Still, by the way, we haven't come across a piece of attacking armour yet,

174
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 just if I might say so, but the "take the helmet of salvation."

175
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And for me, this represents the battle of identity.

176
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 This links back to kind of the whole series that we've been talking about identity.

177
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 The helmet of salvation, for me, this is about protecting our minds, remembering who we are.

178
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 The battleground of identity is between, are we children of God or are we orphans who are lost?

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Remembering who we are is so important.

180
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 You watch those movies where there's a main character who really kind of is struggling through life

181
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 and then faces adversity, faces challenges, gets themselves into a battle,

182
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 but towards the end of the movie, they realise who they are.

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And once they realise who they are, suddenly they have all the power in the world

184
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 and they're able to overcome all the things that they didn't before.

185
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I think sometimes we fight this battle of identity and we forget who we are and we lose this battle.

186
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And the moment we lose it, we forget that we are children of God, that we are protected by the Most High God.

187
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 That is when we give the enemy a foothold, when we start believing the lies that he feeds us.

188
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 So our job here to put on the helmet of salvation is to remember in our minds who we are,

189
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 that we are saved, that that is assured.

190
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And from there, that then determines how we behave.

191
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 You see, when you know who you are, you're not afraid because you know who is behind you.

192
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And that if God is for you, none can be against.

193
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 That no weapon formed against you will prosper because of who is beside you and because of who you are.

194
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 So put on the helmet of salvation and remember who you are.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And the final one is this, the sword of the spirit.

196
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Finally, an attacking piece of armour.

197
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 But still, a sword is not something that we can really use,

198
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 especially when there's darts thrown at us from afar by the enemy.

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So this sword is really just still for close combat, for defending ourselves.

200
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And the battleground for me for this one is when faced with challenges, when in battle,

201
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 and it's the enemies right in your face.

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 What weapons are we going to choose to use?

203
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Are we going to choose to use our own weapons, which would be our own wisdom,

204
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 our own gifts, our own experiences, or do we choose to use God's weapons?

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 When we fight our battles, are we fighting them, are we choosing to fight them on our own?

206
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Or are we relying on the power of God?

207
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 See this last one here, the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.

208
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 God, if we choose to use God's weapons, there are really two elements to this.

209
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Number one is the word of God.

210
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Going back to the first point, the belt of truth, the word of God is truth.

211
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 We fight our battles with truth, with the word of God.

212
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Just like Jesus did when he was face to face with the devil in the desert.

213
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Every time the devil tried to tempt him, he would respond with the word of God.

214
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 How committed are we in using this weapon that is the word of God?

215
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 How committed are we to spending time in his word and finding out more about this battle,

216
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 finding more about this enemy, and ultimately giving us hope

217
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 and reminding ourselves of the victory that is at hand?

218
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 This battleground is so important because if we fight these battles on our own,

219
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 we are doomed to fail.

220
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Remember last week, we said the enemy is powerful, much more powerful than us.

221
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 But if we remember who we are and if we choose to use God's weapons,

222
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 then we will win and we will have the victory.

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 The word of God is so important.

224
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And the second thing, of course, the sword of the spirit also means praying at all times in the spirit.

225
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 How committed are we to praying?

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Praying for the battle that is outside, praying for the virus, praying for the protests,

227
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 praying for all the sides that are involved in this.

228
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 How committed are we to praying?

229
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I was convicted a couple of days ago myself.

230
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I was reading a devotional and it was talking about the passage from the Philippians

231
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 about not being anxious about anything, but in everything, through prayer and supplication,

232
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 present our requests to God.

233
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And then the peace that transcends all understanding will be ours.

234
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And I'm wrestling with this.

235
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And of course, everyone is anxious outside.

236
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And I was just talking to my small group the other day about how Hong Kong is just a city

237
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 that just brings all those anxieties to the forefront.

238
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 For me, it was like, gosh, I am so anxious.

239
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 I am so just worried about everything.

240
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And then this word of God just reminded me to not be anxious about anything, but in everything,

241
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 through prayer and supplication.

242
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And I'm thinking, wow, I don't pray enough.

243
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 I'm anxious because I don't pray enough.

244
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You know, Matthew 6 talks about us not to worry, but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.

245
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And I'm not doing that.

246
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I'm not praying enough.

247
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I'm not spending enough time in the word of God, because it's a very simple equation.

248
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 If we're anxious, but if we pray, then we will have peace.

249
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 So for me, it's how committed am I to pray and spending time with God?

250
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And that's exactly what Jesus did.

251
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 He modelled this for us.

252
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 He came into this world, into the battleground, faced the enemy,

253
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 and he relied on the word of God, and he would regularly go and pray.

254
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 How much do I do that?

255
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 How much do you do that?

256
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And that is my question to you.

257
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 How committed are you to using God's weapons?

258
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Because prayer is a powerful weapon.

259
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 So, brothers and sisters, those are the six points, the belt of truth,

260
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of peace, the shield of faith,

261
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit.

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 As we've whizzed through each of these and we've looked at the battlegrounds that they face,

263
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 my encouragement to you is that the battle has already been won.

264
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Truth will overcome the lies of the devil.

265
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And the second one, righteousness will ultimately win over sin.

266
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 The good news will ultimately have the final say.

267
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And then the next one, faith, hope will ultimately banish all hopelessness.

268
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Our identity, salvation, us being children of God, will be our final identity.

269
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 We will not be made orphans again at the end.

270
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And the final one, let us choose to use God's weapons instead of our own.

271
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Brothers and sisters, it's been a joy to share the word of God with you.

272
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I know it's been short. I know it's hard to just be on our own.

273
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 I know that many of us are struggling with just the loneliness and the isolation and just the anxiety.

274
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 But I pray, I pray that God will remind you of his love and faithfulness to you.

275
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 And that we, as a body of Christ, in Confort Church or in the Church of Hong Kong,

276
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 that we will commit to continue to praying for each other, to spending time in the word of God

277
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 and knowing that if things will happen in this world, in this world there will be trouble.

278
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It is a battle. There is an enemy.

279
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But ultimately, there is the victory.

280
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And our identities are secure.

281
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Love you all. Hope to see you all soon.

282
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Bless you.

283
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,200
 you.
