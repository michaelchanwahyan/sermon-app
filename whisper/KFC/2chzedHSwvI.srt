00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,880
 It's great to be sharing a word with you tonight.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,560
 I'm really excited because we'll be talking about the church in Philadelphia.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,200
 So over the last few weeks, we've been going through the book of Revelations where we've

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,580
 seen so far five churches.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,760
 And let's just say that the Lord have had a little bit more negative comments and judgment

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,680
 than we would have expected.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,400
 And a lot of them were quite negatively commented by the Lord.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,760
 And some of it was that they've lost their first love, which is the love that they had

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,000
 for the Lord.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,440
 And others, they have been a corrupted church.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,720
 I mean, Smyrna was a better one where they were persecuted, but they've stood firm.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,080
 So we've seen that as we're looking at the different churches, we wonder for a moment,

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,640
 is there any church that the Lord is pleased with?

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,640
 And then we come to the church in Philadelphia and we're like, yay, because this is the church

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
 where the Lord has only given positive comments.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,500
 And not only that, but the rewards and the promises that he has in this chapter.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,320
 So as a church, we should really open up our ears because how is it possible that even

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,480
 though no church is perfect on earth, and yet the Lord is able to give such good comments

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,560
 about it.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,720
 So let us learn together so then we can also be a blameless church in His end times.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:56,160
 So let's begin by reading from Revelations 3, verse 7 to 8.

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:04,960
 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, the words of the Holy One, the true

24
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:13,680
 One, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,000
 I know your works, behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 shut.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,600
 I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,720
 my name.

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,760
 Now you know, after we read it, we're like, yes, we kind of get every single word, but

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,360
 no, I'm not quite sure what the Lord wants to say.

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,600
 I mean, what is the Lord saying here?

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,760
 Well, let's begin by looking at Philadelphia.

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
 Where is it?

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,200
 Well, it's located southeast of Sardis, which we've looked at last week.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,160
 And basically it's in a territory where there's a lot of earthquakes.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,600
 And it was so great that many times all the houses would break down and they'll have to

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 move out.

38
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,240
 So it's a very unstable city for the people to live in.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,600
 And not only that, but then the population is very small because they didn't, it wasn't

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,840
 stable, and so they stayed away most of the time.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,000
 But the church that was in there, Philadelphia church, was actually praised by the Lord.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,600
 And as we look further, we see that each time the Lord would describe Himself before He

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,200
 would talk about what He wanted to say to the church.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,120
 But interestingly, this time, the description here, as you see in verse seven, was actually

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,840
 not a vision from chapter one, because all the other churches, when He described Himself,

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,080
 we could see bits and pieces from chapter one.

47
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,520
 But here it's standalone.

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
 And it's very special.

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,240
 He chose four different ways to describe Himself.

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,280
 And the very first one is, this letter was written by whom?

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,360
 The Holy One.

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,200
 Now when we hear the Holy One, who does it describe?

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,440
 It can only describe one, divine God.

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,200
 And so in the very first description, He says, "I'm the divine God that's about to give these

55
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 words."

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,640
 And second, He says, "The true one."

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,880
 Because at that time, there were many gods, and people don't really know which one is

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
 true.

59
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,320
 But He says, "I'm the true one, not a false one, one that you can trust in."

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,320
 And then He continues to describe Himself as the one who holds the key of David, who

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,720
 opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one can open.

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,440
 We're not quite sure what door He's shutting, or what door He's opening at this moment.

63
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,760
 But it's actually a direct reference to Isaiah chapter 22, verse 22.

64
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,520
 If you read it, you'll see that it's almost the same.

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,240
 "And I will place on His shoulder the key of the house of David.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,640
 He shall open and none shall shut, and He shall shut and none shall open."

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,040
 Because of the similarity, we know that it is drawing a reference.

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,720
 So if we understood Isaiah 22 here, it's going to allow us to understand why is it that He

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,160
 would describe Himself this way.

70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,480
 And in Isaiah 22 here, actually King Hezekiah, he actually had chief stewards that would

71
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,680
 look after all the treasures that he had.

72
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,600
 And here he's saying that, "I'm passing it on to a new steward."

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:44,120
 And so when Jesus uses this verse to describe Himself, He's saying, "I have the key to

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,960
 the treasures."

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,640
 And for the stewards here, He has the key to an earthly kingdom.

76
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,480
 But when Jesus is referring it to Himself, He's saying that, "I hold the key to which

77
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
 kingdom?

78
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,880
 The kingdom of God."

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,080
 And so can you imagine, just at the beginning, just the very first line in Philadelphia,

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,160
 He's telling the people that, "I'm the divine God.

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,040
 I'm the true one.

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,760
 I'm the one who holds the key to the kingdom of God, and I have access to it.

83
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,320
 It's at my disposal.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
 And this God is about to speak."

85
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,240
 And I don't know about you, but if this God was about to speak, I would think, "Oh my

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,160
 gosh, He's all the way up here.

87
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,080
 Whatever it is that He's about to say, I would never measure up."

88
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:54,120
 And yet, miraculously, Jesus here, our Lord right here, says nothing bad about this church.

89
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,200
 And so what does He say?

90
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,440
 He says, "I know your works.

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,760
 Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut.

92
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,800
 I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,680
 my name."

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,080
 And so interestingly here, the Lord says, "I know your works," but He actually doesn't

95
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,600
 tell us.

96
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
 What did they do?

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,720
 I mean, we try to look around, but He doesn't say.

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,440
 It just seems like the content didn't matter as much.

99
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,840
 But what matter is the Lord wanted to emphasize that I have my eyes on you.

100
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,160
 I see everything that you do.

101
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,000
 That's the message that He wants to tell the church in Philadelphia.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,800
 But why would He say that?

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,200
 And He says that, "I have set before you an open door."

104
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,000
 Remember in the last verse, He just says, "The kingdom of God and all His treasures

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,960
 is at His disposal."

106
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,120
 And now He's saying, "I've seen your work, and I'm opening that door for you.

107
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,160
 The door to the kingdom of heaven, the door with treasures and blessings, I am opening

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,200
 it for you."

109
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,760
 And so by the time we get to this verse, we'll be like, "Oh my gosh, the Lord is

110
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,120
 pouring out to this church."

111
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,920
 Now He could have just stopped there.

112
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,260
 "Behold, I've set before you an open door," and that would be enough, right?

113
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,320
 But He adds on, "which no one is able to shut."

114
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,480
 Can you imagine the amount of blessing that the Lord wants to pour out in the church of

115
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,440
 Philadelphia?

116
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,640
 And then He says, "I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept My

117
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,160
 word and have not denied My name."

118
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
 Now why is it all of a sudden He mentions this little power?

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,200
 Well, the Lord wants to tell them that it isn't because you're this spiritual giant,

120
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,000
 this great church, and that's why you're able to do everything.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,620
 It is because even though you only have a little power, or some commentaries even say

122
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:20,080
 because there are very few of you, even though there were such limitations in what you have,

123
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,240
 you were still able to keep My words and not deny His name.

124
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,000
 And because of that, the Lord is blessing him.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,400
 And so it comes to our first point I want to share with you, which is the Lord opens

126
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,640
 doors for the faithful.

127
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,560
 It isn't because the church of Philadelphia had more people, had more resources than other

128
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,000
 churches.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
 It wasn't because of that.

130
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,300
 And it wasn't because of what they've done, like they've detailed out, "All right, you

131
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,900
 have done 30 evangelistical meetings, and you've gone to like 100 mission trips."

132
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,440
 It wasn't that.

133
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,920
 He didn't name any of those things.

134
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,880
 But that the Lord was pleased because of what?

135
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,680
 This church, it was faithful.

136
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,200
 Even though they had a little bit, they were faithful.

137
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,460
 And because of that, the Lord is willing to pour out to this church.

138
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:32,800
 And I like to think, and I strongly and truly believe that our church is like that.

139
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,280
 But we are a church where the Lord blesses us.

140
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,240
 I mean, just thinking back, a while ago it was our 35th anniversary, and just seeing

141
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,960
 how many faithful servants we've had in this church, where they've worked hard.

142
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,540
 They've started with not even a building, but just meeting here and there.

143
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,960
 And then slowly, the Lord opened its door, and He has blessed us.

144
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,760
 Now with a building, first one floor, and then He blesses us with another floor.

145
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,240
 Was it because we were more powerful?

146
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,160
 No, we're just like this church, with little power.

147
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,300
 And yet, because the Lord wishes to bless, it keeps on blessing the people.

148
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,560
 And also, I mean, just seeing how He has grown.

149
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,280
 We've started with just the Cantonese, and now we've got the Mandarin congregation.

150
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:39,120
 And look at us, we're a product of that too, the English congregation.

151
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,560
 And it's because the Lord has continued to open the door.

152
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,440
 And this year, even though with COVID, we have Titus Fellowship, who's now addressing

153
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,840
 to the high school kids.

154
00:11:52,840 --> 00:12:01,040
 And we also have the English Mentorship Program, who's helping the local secondary schoolers

155
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,200
 to be able to learn English and know about God.

156
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,060
 And if you're not involved in that and you want to, you can let us know.

157
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,360
 We definitely need more helpers.

158
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,040
 And it's because there are so many faithful servants.

159
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:22,800
 And at the same time, just today, you see we're having a baby room that's coming soon.

160
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,200
 And I could see the Lord is opening His door.

161
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,240
 And that is where we need to continue to be a faithful servant of His.

162
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,840
 Now let's continue to read on.

163
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,360
 In Revelations chapter 3, we continue on with verse 9 to 10.

164
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,840
 "Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are

165
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,800
 not, but lie.

166
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,000
 Behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
 I have loved you.

168
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,120
 Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of

169
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,680
 trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth."

170
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,640
 Now we see this, we're like synagogue of Satan.

171
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,040
 But synagogues for Jews?

172
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,600
 Now if that was going through your mind, then you might have some background to the history

173
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,640
 and also at that time.

174
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,680
 What happened was during that time, most likely there were enough Jewish people, Jews, in

175
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,920
 the place of Philadelphia, where they had their own synagogue.

176
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,040
 But instead of serving the Lord and welcoming Christ, they actually persecuted Christ to

177
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,240
 begin with.

178
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
 And of course, they're also persecuting the Christians there.

179
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,800
 And hence, the Lord is calling them synagogue of Satan.

180
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,480
 Now if you remember, in Revelations chapter 2, verse 9, we've also seen a very similar

181
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,320
 verse where they say, "I know your tribulation and your poverty, and the slander of those

182
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,560
 who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."

183
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:22,960
 So also in the church of Smyrna, where there was a lot of persecution from the Jews, the

184
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,560
 Lord have used the same words, which meant that right now, at that time in Philadelphia,

185
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,840
 they were also going through persecutions from the Jews.

186
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,360
 Now you might wonder, why is it that they're Jews but are not?

187
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,160
 I mean, are they talking about ethnicity?

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,920
 Is this an ethnic issue?

189
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,840
 Now we think it's not.

190
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,760
 I'm pretty sure that those people were born Jews.

191
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,160
 It is more of Jews in the heart.

192
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,360
 And if we look at Romans chapter 2, 28 to 29, we see that, "For no one," this is Apostle

193
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,480
 Paul saying, "For no one is a Jew who is merely one outward, nor is circumcision outward and

194
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 physical.

195
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,920
 The Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the spirit, not

196
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
 by the letter."

197
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:26,280
 So as we see, we can see that in this church in Philadelphia, there were a group of Jews

198
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,920
 that were persecuting the Christians there.

199
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,120
 And what does the Lord say?

200
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,440
 The Lord says, "I will make them bow down before your feet."

201
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,960
 Now bowing down before your feet at that time wasn't like worshipping God.

202
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,840
 This is not the kind that Jesus is referring to.

203
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,360
 This kind of bowing down is when an enemy of yours has been defeated.

204
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,720
 They will bow down before you.

205
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,560
 Now interestingly enough, you know, Jesus could have just stopped there, you know, make

206
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,160
 them bow down, or even say, make them bow down before your feet because I love you.

207
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,760
 That would make sense.

208
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,120
 But here it says, "And they will learn that I have loved you."

209
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,520
 And so we're a little bit confused, you know, why is it that, why do you think Jesus put

210
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,480
 that in?

211
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,280
 Now it's most likely they're making a reference to Romans chapter 11, 13 to 14, where it's

212
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:37,200
 saying that they are, Jesus most likely wanted the Jews to be jealous, to be jealous at the

213
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,440
 love that the Lord has given mostly to Gentiles at that time, because not a lot of Jews have

214
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,520
 converted to Christians at that moment.

215
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,300
 And they wanted to make them jealous.

216
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:54,240
 And so this verse says, "Now I'm speaking to you Gentiles, inasmuch then as I am an

217
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,880
 apostle to the Gentiles," because Apostle Paul was mainly spreading the gospel to the

218
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:07,560
 Gentiles, "I magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous and

219
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,640
 thus save some of them."

220
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,760
 And so here most likely Jesus is saying that, not only will I make them bow down to you,

221
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,520
 but then I'll make them know that I have loved you so that they will have a chance to turn

222
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,800
 back.

223
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,760
 And so we look at this and we see that in the next verse, Jesus says, "Because you

224
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,840
 have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that

225
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,160
 is coming on to the whole earth, to try those who dwell on the earth."

226
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,240
 And I will look at this and we know that Jesus is not only saying that, "I will deliver

227
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,080
 you from your enemies," not only that, but he says that in the hour of trial.

228
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,240
 And we don't know when that hour of trial is.

229
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,320
 But in that hour when the whole world has been trialed, and some people might think

230
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,700
 it's COVID and we're not drawing any conclusions, but isn't there a time when the whole world

231
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,480
 is undergoing a hard time?

232
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,600
 Says that they will be protected.

233
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,120
 Now in here, some people have different theories about how to look at this.

234
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:31,720
 It could be that when Jesus says that they will be kept, that I will keep you from the

235
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,200
 hour of trial, it's possible, some say that it is a rapture before the tribulation, before

236
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
 the great hardship.

237
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,040
 And there are other sayings that it is actually not taking them away from the world, but that

238
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,440
 even though they're going through it, that they will be protected by the Lord.

239
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,960
 So now what does this mean for us?

240
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,440
 Because it's like that in Philadelphia.

241
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
 But what about us?

242
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,080
 I mean, in everyday life, we're still going through some sort of trial.

243
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,680
 Rather people are persecuting us, well, we don't have to die for it, thank God, but persecuting

244
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,360
 us because of our faith, or even, and we might go through a hardship in our life, maybe with

245
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:24,960
 career, maybe with our health, with our relationship, and those are also hard for us to go through.

246
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,000
 Or maybe we might quarrel with someone and we don't know what to do with it.

247
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,880
 And here, the Lord is showing us that He is a Lord who vindicates and who protects us.

248
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:47,920
 And so as we are faithful to Him, as we continue to follow His words, and as we continue to

249
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,440
 not deny His name, He will be the one that vindicates for us and the one that protects

250
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,920
 us, even in the hour of trial.

251
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,280
 And so it should give us Christians great comfort when we're going through hardships

252
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,320
 that the Lord will vindicate and protect us.

253
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,520
 And so let us read on in verse 11 to 13.

254
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,640
 "I'm coming soon.

255
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,680
 Hold fast what you have so that no one may seize your crown.

256
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:28,200
 The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God.

257
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,000
 Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my Lord and the name of

258
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,520
 the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven and my

259
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
 own new name.

260
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,640
 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

261
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,160
 Now notice that the Lord says, "I'm coming," but actually in the few previous churches

262
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,160
 when He said that, you probably don't want it to happen.

263
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,680
 Because the previous churches, like to the church in Ephesus, He says, "I will come

264
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,600
 to you and remove your lampstand."

265
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,240
 It's like, I'm going to come to you and close down your church.

266
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,120
 And or to the church of Pergamum, it says, "I'm coming to make war with you with the

267
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,680
 sword of my mouth."

268
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,200
 And with the church of Sardis, it says, "You'll not know the hour that I come.

269
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,880
 I'll come like a thief."

270
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,880
 Now in all these cases, it's bringing on judgment into the church.

271
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:37,320
 And yet here, when He tells the church in Philadelphia, "I am coming," He's coming

272
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 for them.

273
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:46,000
 He's coming and He's asking them to hold fast, just hold on tight a little bit longer

274
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,440
 so that no one will take their crown.

275
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:58,160
 And so this is a very image that when we are conquerors, we're going to get this crown.

276
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,520
 And this crown that has been talked about here has been talked about in John chapter

277
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,120
 two, verse eight as well, where He says, "Watch yourselves that you do not lose what we have

278
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,800
 accomplished, but that you may receive the full reward."

279
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,960
 So it's like going through our lives.

280
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,720
 As we're faithful, we will get that crown, that reward.

281
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,280
 And if we continue and persist, then the Lord has rewards for us.

282
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,960
 And what are those rewards?

283
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,000
 And we look at those, it's like, I know, it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense for

284
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,760
 us to want a pillar in the temple, but it'll make more sense in eternal sense.

285
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,400
 Let me tell you why.

286
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,360
 Because a pillar in the temple at that time meant that the honored people's names would

287
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,120
 be engraved in these pillars.

288
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,700
 And remember in Philadelphia, they were actually in a place where there were a lot of earthquakes.

289
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,600
 So what that meant was their home was always shaken.

290
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,560
 And today they might be well here, but the next day they might need to move out and come

291
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,400
 back and rebuild it.

292
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,240
 But to them, this will be an eternal home, immovable, unshakable.

293
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,800
 And so this is what the Lord is promising them as a reward.

294
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,840
 You, I will make Him.

295
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 So they would be these pillars in the temple of my God.

296
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,240
 And never shall we go out.

297
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,000
 And I write on Him the name of my Lord.

298
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,480
 Now to be written, to belong to the Lord meant that, to have His name on them means that

299
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,800
 they would belong to the Lord.

300
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:44,960
 And at the very end, it also says that they will have the name of the city of my God,

301
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,120
 the new Jerusalem written there.

302
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
 What does that mean?

303
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,240
 It means that they're going to get a new citizenship.

304
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,440
 It's not a citizenship on earth.

305
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,760
 It's a citizenship in heaven, eternal, forever.

306
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,660
 And that's what the Lord is promising them.

307
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,720
 And finally it says that they will have my own name.

308
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,680
 So this really is a reward of how they are going to have a place, a citizenship, that

309
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,080
 they belong to the Lord in new Jerusalem.

310
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,600
 And of course, we end this passage with, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit

311
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,800
 says to the churches."

312
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,200
 And so what we see in the last three verses is that the Lord is a Lord who rewards His

313
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 faithful ones.

314
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,200
 And we have seen that throughout the five churches so far, and this is our sixth church.

315
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:48,280
 And we know that the Lord asks of the Philadelphians to be faithful and continue on doing that.

316
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,040
 Now I know it's not easy because we don't even know.

317
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
 What does it mean to be faithful every day?

318
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,600
 I mean, are we faithful every day?

319
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,160
 How do we know we're faithful every day?

320
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,100
 What does it look like to be faithful every day?

321
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,920
 What does it look like?

322
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,560
 Have you thought about it?

323
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,080
 Are you faithful to the Lord?

324
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,240
 How do we know?

325
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,080
 And so I want to share a little bit about what faithfulness might look like in our everyday

326
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,000
 life.

327
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,660
 Faithfulness is not being this gigantic spiritual giant where you can memorize the Bible verse

328
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,120
 by verse.

329
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,400
 And it isn't meaning like you come to church every single week.

330
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
 That makes you faithful.

331
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,880
 But what is faithful is that we would be able to do with what we have and give it to the

332
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
 Lord.

333
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,960
 Let me tell you what it was like.

334
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:59,800
 There was a time in my life when I shared a little bit in another sermon where because

335
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:07,040
 of a failed relationship, I've also gone south with my career because I quit my job back

336
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
 then.

337
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,680
 I was in a really bad emotional state at that time.

338
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,280
 And it was so bad that I didn't even want to live, let alone be a Christian.

339
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,000
 And I thought to myself, what's the point?

340
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,560
 What's the point of being a Christian?

341
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,440
 I've been a Christian like 20 years of my life at that time.

342
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,080
 But things are just still not working out.

343
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,920
 I mean, I go to church, I do these, and I pray.

344
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,220
 What's the point?

345
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:47,040
 And I really thought about maybe this whole Christian thing, God.

346
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,880
 I can put it down.

347
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
 Maybe.

348
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,880
 And I just thought, you know, in those moments of hardship, it just doesn't seem to make

349
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,840
 sense to keep going.

350
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:11,120
 And yet, the little power, the very little power in my heart knew that.

351
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,520
 But the Lord is real.

352
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,360
 I don't know how it's going to happen, but I know He's real.

353
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,600
 What can I do?

354
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,120
 Because I have such little power.

355
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,720
 And it was at that time, and there was nothing to do, that I just did the only thing I could

356
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 do.

357
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,600
 And do you know what that was?

358
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,080
 To pray.

359
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
 That takes zero effort, almost.

360
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,600
 You can lie on your bed, you can be anywhere, and just pray.

361
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,400
 But because of that prayer, things started changing.

362
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,840
 And I wouldn't even be able to flip the Bible open, because I was in such a bad state.

363
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,120
 And did you know what I had done?

364
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,000
 Just what I could.

365
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,200
 And what was I able to do?

366
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:08,640
 I was able to take my phone out, turn on to YouTube, and listen to a sermon.

367
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,240
 You know, that takes about this motion.

368
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,760
 That was the only ounce of effort I had.

369
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,760
 And the Lord opened the doors with just that little effort.

370
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,960
 And I think within a year, I've heard a thousand sermons, about three a day.

371
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,920
 And that started to change me, because the Lord started to open up His doors to heaven.

372
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,840
 It started pouring down, and I finally began to have a relationship with Him.

373
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,080
 To know Him in a more personal way.

374
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,520
 And then I began to be able to read the Bible.

375
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,040
 And because He opened the door for me, suddenly the Bible verses that I never understood,

376
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,760
 it just popped up.

377
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,600
 It just made sense.

378
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,160
 And I didn't know why.

379
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:10,600
 It was the opening of the doors to heaven that the Lord chose to open.

380
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:19,720
 And so I believe that when the Lord asks us to keep on being faithful, He's not asking—

381
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,320
 He's just meeting us where we are.

382
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,960
 If you're going through a hard time with your career, and if you can't find out what to

383
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,920
 do next, maybe you can't even get a job.

384
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,760
 Maybe you're going through a tough time in your relationship, or you're not even sure

385
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,640
 if your family likes you.

386
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,800
 Like if there's a lot of things that we can go through in our lives.

387
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:50,000
 But the Lord says, if we're faithful with just the ounce that we have, whatever it may

388
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:04,200
 be in your case, He is able to open that door, and He will give us access to the heavens.

389
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,280
 And so today, as we read these verses, we see that the Lord wishes to bless us.

390
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,480
 And He wants to open the door for the faithful ones.

391
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:21,480
 And He will vindicate for us and protect us if we continue to be faithful, doing whatever

392
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,760
 it is that we have, the little ounces.

393
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,760
 And the Lord will reward us.

394
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,420
 And so, you know, sometimes we want to think, do we want to be working our lives, living

395
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:43,960
 through our lives for an extra footage in our apartment, or do we want to live our lives

396
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,640
 so that we would be the pillar in the eternal heaven?

397
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,680
 Do we want to have a citizenship elsewhere in the world where we get to live a different

398
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,800
 lifestyle, or do we want a citizenship in heaven?

399
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:09,840
 And with God's name written on us, with a new name, a new status that He would give

400
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,320
 us?

401
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,280
 And I think most of us would answer that we want the latter ones.

402
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,520
 And so let us continue to really continue to be faithful in Him.

403
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,880
 Whatever you are, whatever stage you're in with your relationship with God, He wants

404
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,140
 to meet us there.

405
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:39,800
 And when we give that little ounce of faithfulness, He will pour out to us, and He'll vindicate

406
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,780
 for us in whatever situation we're in.

407
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,420
 And the reward is also waiting for us.

408
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,100
 And so Jesus Himself alone is enough for us.

409
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:57,900
 And let us remember to never turn back, even in the hardest times in our lives, that we

410
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:07,180
 will press on, knowing that Jesus is enough, and that He's with us, and He loves us, and

411
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,020
 He'll meet us where we are.

412
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,780
 Let us pray together.

413
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:23,460
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you that even though we're weak, even though we have very

414
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:32,140
 little faith sometimes, that Father, you will meet us where we are, and you're just willing

415
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:42,260
 and wanting to open up heavens for us, to protect us in our hard times, and to reward

416
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
 us.

417
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,060
 And Father, we pray that in our walk with you, in our relationship, in our journey with

418
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:57,100
 you, Father, that you would continue to help us, that whenever any of us cries out, Father,

419
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,500
 that we'll know that you love us.

420
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,980
 I sense that some people here today may not feel that the Lord loves them.

421
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:19,180
 And Father, I pray for that truth to sink in, that it is your love that draws us.

422
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,960
 It is this relationship that you yearn for us.

423
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:32,220
 And so Father, we're praying a special blessing for those who don't feel you close, who don't

424
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,860
 feel your presence in their lives now.

425
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:43,700
 We pray that your Holy Spirit will fill them, and that you would help them to give that

426
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:50,420
 little ounce of faith, and continue their journey with you, and to love you.

427
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,500
 Father God, thank you for your love for us.

428
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,940
 Your love, your guidance, and your salvation is enough for us.

429
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,380
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
