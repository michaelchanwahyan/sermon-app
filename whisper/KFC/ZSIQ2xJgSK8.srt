1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
我們這個月2021,我們在說一個系列,你知道這個系列叫什麼名字嗎?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Identity

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
是的,Identity and Relationship,今天很有參與力,這麼好

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
然後我們開始的時候,我們就說我們的身份在哪裡?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
在神那裡,我們是在祂的形象中製造的

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
然後我們Pastor Gavin就和我們分享,我們的新的身份在於耶穌,因為我們接受了主耶穌,就有一個新的身份

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:54,000
然後我們就學了,我們是神的兒女,然後上個星期Pastor Irene幫我們說,我們的回應是什麼?我們怎麼可以做一個真實的,我們怎麼可以真實的對自己

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
然後今天我們就會說我們的回應,我們怎麼可以真實在我們的關係中

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:15,000
我們這個世界有很多東西是真實的對假的,你覺得有什麼是真實的對假的呢?

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
我有三個例子

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
人和人之間的真實與假的朋友

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:39,000
這個世界有很多東西是假的,很多假的手袋,很多假的鞋子,在女人街可以找到很多假的東西

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
現在很多人都有假錢,假金錢

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
這個面膜是什麼?

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
是不是forgery?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:07,000
很多人都是fake的,他放了面膜,有些人對你前面是很好的,但在你背後就說很多壞話

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
有些人是fake,他說很想和你玩,很想和你打球,然後就不理你

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
有沒有人是有這樣的朋友?

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
我有

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
我有一個朋友就是去年和前年都是欺負我的

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
然後無端端在七年級的中間的時候,突然間進我的群組,對我很好

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
今天我們讀一個passage

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:14,000
(文字上的文字不太好,請看影片資訊欄)

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:27,000
(文字上的文字不太好,請看影片資訊欄)

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:41,000
今天我們讀這個passage,會看到Samuel如何變成一個真正的人,和神如何保持他的真正的保證

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
第一個point,我們看到Samuel overcome the disappointment of the rejection of Saul as king

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
你們知不知道以色列第一個王是誰?

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
他的名字叫做Saul,是很高大的

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
聖經說他是head above everybody else

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
one head above everybody else

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
當然沒有姚明那麼高,姚明是七尺三或七尺四

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He is head above everybody else

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
我們看第一個point,是Saul overcome the disappointment of rejection

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
他做high priest是第一個去annoy Saul

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
他很傷心,因為Saul去disobey God

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
他就recognize他自己有一個right time

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
神就跟他說有一個right time

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
有一個right time to mourn,有一個right time to get up and anoint the next king

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
神就跟他說,How long will you grieve over Saul since I have rejected him over Israel?

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Fill your horn with oil and go

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
神就跟他說,Fill your horn with oil,你會去go and anoint the next king

42
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
我們做一個real person,跟我們的friend的時候

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
我們都要recognize我們每個人都有一個right time

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
有時我們會sad,有時我們會happy

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
有時我們是要主動去做動作

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
我們看下一個point,是Samuel is sent to Jesse of Bethlehem, the grandson of Ruth and Boaz

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
我們看到神保持他的right promise

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
神的promise就是,1st Abraham會有descendants as numerous as the stars

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
他的line是繼續去through Ruth,跟著去through Jesse

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
所以我們看到神保持他的covenant,他的ultimate promise

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
我們做一個real friend,都要保持我們的promise

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Next, Samuel fears Saul when asked to follow God's plan

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
你可能看到很多古代的故事

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
如果你去anoint another king,會怎樣?

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
王會accuse you of treason,很嚴重的

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
可能有punishment,major punishment,可能是death

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Samuel跟神說,我怎可以去anoint another king?

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
現在是king,他聽到我去anoint一個king,就會想去追我

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:00,000
神怎樣comfort他?神跟他說,I will show you what you shall do

60
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
是不是很comforting?

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Among fear,我們害怕的時候,神有沒有跟你說,I will show you what you will do

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Samuel就place他的right fear給誰?

63
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
他的fear不是Saul,他的fear是towards obeying God

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ok, next slide

65
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
God rules Israel even though his people rejected him as king

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The right authority

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
我們做一個real person的時候,我們都要recognize

68
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
我們的real right authority,real authority在哪裏?

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
我們的real authority是from 神

70
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
以色列是reject神,是king

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
他們說,這個nation有king,那個nation有king,我們都想要個king

72
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
我們不想一個invisible king,我們想要一個real king,一個人是king

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
但是ultimately,誰anoint那個king?

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
是God anointed that king

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ultimately, he had the authority to anoint the king

76
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ok,我們繼續看Samuel 16:6-10

77
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
When they came, he looked at Elib and thought

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ok, Samuel去探了Jesse

79
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
跟著跟Jesse說,你是不是有很多子女?

80
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
你可不可以邀請你的子女給我?

81
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
我會anoint一個king from 你的子女那裏

82
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
第一個子女是誰?

83
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Elib, and thought, he looked at Elib and thought

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Surely the Lord's anointed is before him

85
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But the Lord said to Samuel, do not look at his appearance or on the height of his stature

86
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because I have rejected him

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
For the Lord sees not a man's appearance

88
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Man looks on the outward appearance

89
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The Lord looks at the heart

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Then Jesse called Abin-Abdab

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And made him pass before Samuel

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And he said, neither has the Lord chosen this one

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Then Jesse made Shammath pass by

94
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And he said, neither has the Lord chosen this one

95
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And Samuel said to Jesse, the Lord has not chosen these

97
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Then Samuel said to Jesse, are all these your sons here?

98
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And Jesse said, there remains one, the youngest

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But behold, he is keeping the sheep

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And Samuel said to Jesse, send and get him

101
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
For we will not sit down until he comes

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And he sent and brought him in

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now he was rugged and had beautiful eyes and was handsome

104
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And the Lord said, arise, anoint him, for this is he

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And Samuel took the horns of oil and anointed him, poured oil on him

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And made him, anointed him in the midst of his brothers

107
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
OK, we see many different points here

109
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
First, Samuel is held back by his own perception of others

110
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He sees the first son, how is the first son?

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He is tall and looks like a king

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But what does the Lord say to him?

113
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Do not look at his appearance of his height and his stature

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For I have rejected him as king

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
神很清楚地跟Samuel說

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
不要有你自己的perception做一個barrier

117
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
我們很多時候看到人就有一個perception

118
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
他是什麼人,他是什麼人,他好像怎樣

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
我們有時候看外表

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
但神說什麼?

121
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Man looks at the outward appearance

122
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But the Lord looks at the heart

123
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
神是看我們的心

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
God looks at the heart

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
如果我們有一個real relationship

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
我們要有一個right perception of others

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
我們要看我們身邊的人

128
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
as how God looks at them

129
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We have to see people as how God looks at them

130
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
第二,我們看Samuel finds the right son

131
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
有多少個兒子?

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Jesse有多少個兒子?

133
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
有七個兒子

134
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
然後他和Jesse說

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
這是不是你的所有兒子?

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's not all his sons

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
是Jesse還有一個兒子叫David

138
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
為什麼這麼有趣?

139
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
他不讓Jesse派出來給Samuel看?

140
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
因為Jesse had the wrong judgment of David

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
他小看了David

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
他覺得David最小的兒子

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
他可能十二、十三歲

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
很多人都是十二、十三歲

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
就可能看他還沒有準備好

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
他可能還沒有King的外表

147
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Jesse的爸爸可能給了一個錯誤的判斷

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
對他的兒子David

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
但是Samuel看到他就說

150
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Samuel就說

151
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Is this your son?

152
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This is his son

153
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Arise!神就說Arise! Anoint him!

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
For this is he

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Samuel anoints David as King

156
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The right choice

157
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
對的選擇

158
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
God said

159
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Now he was rugged and beautiful

160
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
had beautiful eyes and was handsome

161
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Arise! Anoint him! For this is he

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
神就Anoint the right King

163
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
David

164
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
我們看到聖經

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
David是a man after God's heart

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
David是什麼王?

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He is mentioned more than a thousand times in the Bible

168
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
他是一個one of the most popular kings

169
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He wrote the psalms

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
撕篇

171
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He poured out his heart

172
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
在不同的撕篇去解釋他的feeling towards God

173
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
很多的祈禱

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
今天我們看到這個故事

175
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
How to be real in our relationships

176
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Samuel我們看到第一就是right time

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Samuel看到他有一個right time

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
有時要mourn的

179
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
有時要開心的

180
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
有時要主動去跟隨神

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The right promise

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The right fear

183
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The right authority

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The right perception of others

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The right judgment of others

186
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
有時我們會有一個wrong judgment

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
好像Jesse對他的youngest son David

188
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
然後我們要make a right choice

189
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Ok next slide我們看到

190
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
我們要characterize

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
第一

192
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If we are to be real

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
我們要有一個right foundation

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
我們的right authority

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
應該是recognize

196
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
神是我們的right authority

197
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He is 去創造我們的

198
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
他是in control的

199
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
然後我們要有一個right fear

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The right fear is that

201
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
we need to fear the Lord most of all

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
然後我們要understand ourselves

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We need to understand ourselves

204
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
我們要有一個right perception of ourselves

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Samuel的perception

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
第一個兒子就說

207
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
這麼高大這麼偉大

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
他應該是做王的

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
但神就說No

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
God looks at the heart

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
我們都要有一個right perception of ourselves

212
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
我們學了

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We are made in God's image

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Pastor Gavin解釋給我們聽

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
我們的identity is found in Christ

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
我們要有一個right perception of ourselves

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If we are to have right real relationships

218
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
然後我們都要有right timing

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
我們要understand我們自己

220
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
有時我們是有up and down的

221
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
我們不用去be fake的

222
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We need to be real

223
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
with ourselves and with others

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
第三就要treat others in a real way

225
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
我們怎樣可以treat others in a real way呢

226
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
我們要有一個right promise

227
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The right promise

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We need to be right promise

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
with honesty and with good character

230
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
我們怎樣可以做一個real friend

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
一個real person呢

232
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
我們要have right promises

233
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't have lies, right promises

234
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
我們看人都要有一個right judgment

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We need to see others as God sees them

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
然後我們要做對的選擇

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We need to make right choices

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
when we are with our friends

239
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
我們和我們的朋友是要做對的選擇

240
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
我們要有愛心去愛他們

241
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
As God loves them

242
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
我show you a diagram

243
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
我快完結了

244
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
As we know ourselves more

245
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
我們怎樣可以認識我們自己呢

246
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
As we know ourselves more

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
我們認識神

248
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
怎樣去認識神呢

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
去讀聖經

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
去崇拜

251
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
有團契的時間

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
祈禱的時間

253
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
我們認識神的時候

254
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
我們就understand ourselves more

255
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We will know ourselves more

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
因為我們是made in God's image

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
我們的identity is in Christ

258
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
我們接受主耶穌

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
我們救主的時候

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
我們就recognize我們的identity

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
在神那裡

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
然後我們可以怎樣呢

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
我們就可以有real relationships

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The next slide

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
就有real relationships

266
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
因為我recognize我自己是誰

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
我認識神的authority是什麼

268
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
我們就可以become real

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
我們不會很insecure

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
我們自己是誰

271
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
我們不會看到我們身邊的人

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
有judgment

273
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We will see others as real

274
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
As God sees them

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And then we can have real relationships

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The next slide

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
我就分享我自己小時候

278
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
我做小朋友

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
在12、13歲的時候

280
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
我都很多時候wonder

281
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
我看到我的朋友

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
在high school的時候

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
每個人都有BFF

284
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
每個人都有best friend

285
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
我就跟神說

286
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
為什麼我沒有best friend

287
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
我一個是only child

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
誰是only child

289
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
我是only child的時候

290
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
有時候沒有那麼多social skill

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
沒有那麼多skill去跟人分享

292
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
聽別人說話

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
我就慢慢要學神

294
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
教我怎樣可以做一個good friend

295
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
慢慢地我就跟別人聊天

296
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Learn how to talk with others

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Share with others

298
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
關心我的朋友

299
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And listen to他們的problems

300
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
然後神就給了我

301
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
很好的朋友

302
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
BFF

303
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
很多不同的real friend

304
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Ok, so here are my 6 tips

305
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
towards being a real friend

306
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
第一是honesty

307
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
如果你的朋友不可以相信你

308
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He won't be your friend

309
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Every time他跟你說話

310
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
他以為Johnny是不是說真理

311
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
還是說謊話

312
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He won't want to be your friend

313
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
每次都不知道你是說真的還是說假的

314
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The first thing is honesty

315
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The second thing is take initiative

316
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
我們要care我們的朋友

317
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
我們要主動跟他們做朋友

318
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
跟他們玩

319
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
跟他們玩遊戲機

320
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
跟他們去hang out

321
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
第三是find common points of interest

322
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Build relationship, build trust

323
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
第四是關心我們的朋友

324
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
去care for他們,去愛他們

325
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
你有問候你的朋友

326
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
你怎樣?我聽說你之前病了

327
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
你怎樣?你的測試我聽說很難

328
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
你做得怎樣?

329
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
我們要be vulnerable

330
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Share our struggles

331
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
之前我們要學到the right timing

332
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
有時我們會mourn

333
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
有時我們會喜樂

334
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We need to share our struggles as well

335
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
第六是share Jesus

336
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There is nothing greater than sharing Jesus with our friends

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
我有很多不同的朋友

338
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
有些是打球的朋友

339
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
有些是爬山的朋友

340
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
但最重要的是朋友可以一起祈禱

341
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
可以一起分享屬靈的東西

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Spiritual的東西

343
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
我們看到怎樣去be real friend

344
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Jesus was our ultimate example of a real friend

345
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Jesus was honest

346
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Jesus took initiative

347
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Jesus took initiative

348
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Jesus connected with different people

349
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
和一個Samaritan woman

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
他用水去和她connect

351
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
他關心人

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He healed the leper

353
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
He touched the leper

354
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
He healed the sick

355
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Jesus was vulnerable

356
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
他和門徒說,我是很有sadness

357
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
他和門徒說,Be open, be vulnerable

358
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
然後耶穌分享了自己

359
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This is my prayer to you

360
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
這個是我的祈禱

361
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You will get to know God more

362
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You will understand yourself

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And become more like God

364
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You can be a real friend like Jesus

365
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Jesus is the real friend

366
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
耶穌是最好的朋友

367
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
他是我們的最好的例子

368
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Let us pray

369
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
God help us to become more like you

370
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
To become a real friend

371
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So that we can share you with others

372
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
In Christ's name we pray, Amen
