[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]  我們這個月2021,我們在說一個系列,你知道這個系列叫什麼名字嗎?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]  Identity
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  是的,Identity and Relationship,今天很有參與力,這麼好
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  然後我們開始的時候,我們就說我們的身份在哪裡?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  在神那裡,我們是在祂的形象中製造的
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  然後我們Pastor Gavin就和我們分享,我們的新的身份在於耶穌,因為我們接受了主耶穌,就有一個新的身份
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  然後我們就學了,我們是神的兒女,然後上個星期Pastor Irene幫我們說,我們的回應是什麼?我們怎麼可以做一個真實的,我們怎麼可以真實的對自己
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  然後今天我們就會說我們的回應,我們怎麼可以真實在我們的關係中
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  我們這個世界有很多東西是真實的對假的,你覺得有什麼是真實的對假的呢?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  我有三個例子
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  人和人之間的真實與假的朋友
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  這個世界有很多東西是假的,很多假的手袋,很多假的鞋子,在女人街可以找到很多假的東西
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  現在很多人都有假錢,假金錢
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  這個面膜是什麼?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  是不是forgery?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  很多人都是fake的,他放了面膜,有些人對你前面是很好的,但在你背後就說很多壞話
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  有些人是fake,他說很想和你玩,很想和你打球,然後就不理你
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  有沒有人是有這樣的朋友?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  我有
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  我有一個朋友就是去年和前年都是欺負我的
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  然後無端端在七年級的中間的時候,突然間進我的群組,對我很好
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  今天我們讀一個passage
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  (文字上的文字不太好,請看影片資訊欄)
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  (文字上的文字不太好,請看影片資訊欄)
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  今天我們讀這個passage,會看到Samuel如何變成一個真正的人,和神如何保持他的真正的保證
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  第一個point,我們看到Samuel overcome the disappointment of the rejection of Saul as king
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  你們知不知道以色列第一個王是誰?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  他的名字叫做Saul,是很高大的
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  聖經說他是head above everybody else
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  one head above everybody else
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  當然沒有姚明那麼高,姚明是七尺三或七尺四
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  He is head above everybody else
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  我們看第一個point,是Saul overcome the disappointment of rejection
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  他做high priest是第一個去annoy Saul
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  他很傷心,因為Saul去disobey God
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  他就recognize他自己有一個right time
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  神就跟他說有一個right time
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]  有一個right time to mourn,有一個right time to get up and anoint the next king
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  神就跟他說,How long will you grieve over Saul since I have rejected him over Israel?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]  Fill your horn with oil and go
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  神就跟他說,Fill your horn with oil,你會去go and anoint the next king
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  我們做一個real person,跟我們的friend的時候
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  我們都要recognize我們每個人都有一個right time
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  有時我們會sad,有時我們會happy
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  有時我們是要主動去做動作
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  我們看下一個point,是Samuel is sent to Jesse of Bethlehem, the grandson of Ruth and Boaz
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  我們看到神保持他的right promise
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  神的promise就是,1st Abraham會有descendants as numerous as the stars
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  他的line是繼續去through Ruth,跟著去through Jesse
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  所以我們看到神保持他的covenant,他的ultimate promise
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  我們做一個real friend,都要保持我們的promise
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]  Next, Samuel fears Saul when asked to follow God's plan
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  你可能看到很多古代的故事
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  如果你去anoint another king,會怎樣?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  王會accuse you of treason,很嚴重的
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  可能有punishment,major punishment,可能是death
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  Samuel跟神說,我怎可以去anoint another king?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  現在是king,他聽到我去anoint一個king,就會想去追我
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  神怎樣comfort他?神跟他說,I will show you what you shall do
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  是不是很comforting?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  Among fear,我們害怕的時候,神有沒有跟你說,I will show you what you will do
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  Samuel就place他的right fear給誰?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  他的fear不是Saul,他的fear是towards obeying God
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  Ok, next slide
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]  God rules Israel even though his people rejected him as king
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  The right authority
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  我們做一個real person的時候,我們都要recognize
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  我們的real right authority,real authority在哪裏?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  我們的real authority是from 神
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  以色列是reject神,是king
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  他們說,這個nation有king,那個nation有king,我們都想要個king
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  我們不想一個invisible king,我們想要一個real king,一個人是king
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  但是ultimately,誰anoint那個king?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  是God anointed that king
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  ultimately, he had the authority to anoint the king
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  Ok,我們繼續看Samuel 16:6-10
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]  When they came, he looked at Elib and thought
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  Ok, Samuel去探了Jesse
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  跟著跟Jesse說,你是不是有很多子女?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  你可不可以邀請你的子女給我?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  我會anoint一個king from 你的子女那裏
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]  第一個子女是誰?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  Elib, and thought, he looked at Elib and thought
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  Surely the Lord's anointed is before him
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  But the Lord said to Samuel, do not look at his appearance or on the height of his stature
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  Because I have rejected him
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  For the Lord sees not a man's appearance
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  Man looks on the outward appearance
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  The Lord looks at the heart
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  Then Jesse called Abin-Abdab
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]  And made him pass before Samuel
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  And he said, neither has the Lord chosen this one
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  Then Jesse made Shammath pass by
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  And he said, neither has the Lord chosen this one
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  And Samuel said to Jesse, the Lord has not chosen these
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]  Then Samuel said to Jesse, are all these your sons here?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  And Jesse said, there remains one, the youngest
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  But behold, he is keeping the sheep
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  And Samuel said to Jesse, send and get him
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  For we will not sit down until he comes
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  And he sent and brought him in
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]  Now he was rugged and had beautiful eyes and was handsome
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  And the Lord said, arise, anoint him, for this is he
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  And Samuel took the horns of oil and anointed him, poured oil on him
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  And made him, anointed him in the midst of his brothers
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  OK, we see many different points here
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  First, Samuel is held back by his own perception of others
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  He sees the first son, how is the first son?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  He is tall and looks like a king
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  But what does the Lord say to him?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  Do not look at his appearance of his height and his stature
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  For I have rejected him as king
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  神很清楚地跟Samuel說
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  不要有你自己的perception做一個barrier
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  我們很多時候看到人就有一個perception
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  他是什麼人,他是什麼人,他好像怎樣
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  我們有時候看外表
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  但神說什麼?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  Man looks at the outward appearance
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  But the Lord looks at the heart
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  神是看我們的心
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  God looks at the heart
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  如果我們有一個real relationship
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  我們要有一個right perception of others
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  我們要看我們身邊的人
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]  as how God looks at them
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  We have to see people as how God looks at them
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  第二,我們看Samuel finds the right son
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  有多少個兒子?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  Jesse有多少個兒子?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  有七個兒子
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  然後他和Jesse說
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]  這是不是你的所有兒子?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  It's not all his sons
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  是Jesse還有一個兒子叫David
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  為什麼這麼有趣?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  他不讓Jesse派出來給Samuel看?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  因為Jesse had the wrong judgment of David
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  他小看了David
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  他覺得David最小的兒子
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  他可能十二、十三歲
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  很多人都是十二、十三歲
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  就可能看他還沒有準備好
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  他可能還沒有King的外表
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  Jesse的爸爸可能給了一個錯誤的判斷
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]  對他的兒子David
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  但是Samuel看到他就說
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  Samuel就說
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  Is this your son?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]  This is his son
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  Arise!神就說Arise! Anoint him!
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  For this is he
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  Samuel anoints David as King
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  The right choice
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  對的選擇
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  God said
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  Now he was rugged and beautiful
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]  had beautiful eyes and was handsome
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  Arise! Anoint him! For this is he
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  神就Anoint the right King
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  David
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  我們看到聖經
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  David是a man after God's heart
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  David是什麼王?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  He is mentioned more than a thousand times in the Bible
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  他是一個one of the most popular kings
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  He wrote the psalms
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  撕篇
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  He poured out his heart
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  在不同的撕篇去解釋他的feeling towards God
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  很多的祈禱
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  今天我們看到這個故事
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]  How to be real in our relationships
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  Samuel我們看到第一就是right time
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  Samuel看到他有一個right time
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  有時要mourn的
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  有時要開心的
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  有時要主動去跟隨神
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]  The right promise
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  The right fear
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  The right authority
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  The right perception of others
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  The right judgment of others
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  有時我們會有一個wrong judgment
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  好像Jesse對他的youngest son David
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  然後我們要make a right choice
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  Ok next slide我們看到
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]  我們要characterize
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  第一
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  If we are to be real
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  我們要有一個right foundation
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  我們的right authority
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  應該是recognize
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  神是我們的right authority
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  He is 去創造我們的
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  他是in control的
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  然後我們要有一個right fear
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  The right fear is that
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  we need to fear the Lord most of all
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  然後我們要understand ourselves
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  We need to understand ourselves
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  我們要有一個right perception of ourselves
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  Samuel的perception
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  第一個兒子就說
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  這麼高大這麼偉大
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  他應該是做王的
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]  但神就說No
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  God looks at the heart
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  我們都要有一個right perception of ourselves
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  我們學了
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  We are made in God's image
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  Pastor Gavin解釋給我們聽
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  我們的identity is found in Christ
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  我們要有一個right perception of ourselves
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  If we are to have right real relationships
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  然後我們都要有right timing
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  我們要understand我們自己
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]  有時我們是有up and down的
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]  我們不用去be fake的
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  We need to be real
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]  with ourselves and with others
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  第三就要treat others in a real way
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  我們怎樣可以treat others in a real way呢
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  我們要有一個right promise
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]  The right promise
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  We need to be right promise
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  with honesty and with good character
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  我們怎樣可以做一個real friend
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  一個real person呢
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]  我們要have right promises
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  Don't have lies, right promises
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  我們看人都要有一個right judgment
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  We need to see others as God sees them
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  然後我們要做對的選擇
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  We need to make right choices
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]  when we are with our friends
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  我們和我們的朋友是要做對的選擇
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  我們要有愛心去愛他們
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  As God loves them
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  我show you a diagram
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  我快完結了
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  As we know ourselves more
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  我們怎樣可以認識我們自己呢
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]  As we know ourselves more
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  我們認識神
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  怎樣去認識神呢
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  去讀聖經
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  去崇拜
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  有團契的時間
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  祈禱的時間
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  我們認識神的時候
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]  我們就understand ourselves more
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  We will know ourselves more
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  因為我們是made in God's image
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  我們的identity is in Christ
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  我們接受主耶穌
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  我們救主的時候
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  我們就recognize我們的identity
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  在神那裡
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]  然後我們可以怎樣呢
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  我們就可以有real relationships
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  The next slide
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  就有real relationships
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  因為我recognize我自己是誰
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]  我認識神的authority是什麼
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]  我們就可以become real
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  我們不會很insecure
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]  我們自己是誰
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]  我們不會看到我們身邊的人
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  有judgment
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  We will see others as real
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]  As God sees them
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]  And then we can have real relationships
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  The next slide
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  我就分享我自己小時候
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]  我做小朋友
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  在12、13歲的時候
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  我都很多時候wonder
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  我看到我的朋友
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]  在high school的時候
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  每個人都有BFF
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  每個人都有best friend
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  我就跟神說
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  為什麼我沒有best friend
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  我一個是only child
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]  誰是only child
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  我是only child的時候
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  有時候沒有那麼多social skill
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  沒有那麼多skill去跟人分享
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  聽別人說話
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  我就慢慢要學神
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]  教我怎樣可以做一個good friend
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  慢慢地我就跟別人聊天
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  Learn how to talk with others
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  Share with others
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  關心我的朋友
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  And listen to他們的problems
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  然後神就給了我
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  很好的朋友
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  BFF
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  很多不同的real friend
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  Ok, so here are my 6 tips
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  towards being a real friend
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  第一是honesty
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  如果你的朋友不可以相信你
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  He won't be your friend
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  Every time他跟你說話
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]  他以為Johnny是不是說真理
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]  還是說謊話
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]  He won't want to be your friend
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]  每次都不知道你是說真的還是說假的
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]  The first thing is honesty
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  The second thing is take initiative
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  我們要care我們的朋友
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]  我們要主動跟他們做朋友
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  跟他們玩
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  跟他們玩遊戲機
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  跟他們去hang out
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]  第三是find common points of interest
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]  Build relationship, build trust
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]  第四是關心我們的朋友
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  去care for他們,去愛他們
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  你有問候你的朋友
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  你怎樣?我聽說你之前病了
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  你怎樣?你的測試我聽說很難
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]  你做得怎樣?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  我們要be vulnerable
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  Share our struggles
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  之前我們要學到the right timing
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]  有時我們會mourn
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]  有時我們會喜樂
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]  We need to share our struggles as well
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]  第六是share Jesus
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  There is nothing greater than sharing Jesus with our friends
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  我有很多不同的朋友
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]  有些是打球的朋友
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]  有些是爬山的朋友
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  但最重要的是朋友可以一起祈禱
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]  可以一起分享屬靈的東西
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]  Spiritual的東西
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]  我們看到怎樣去be real friend
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]  Jesus was our ultimate example of a real friend
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  Jesus was honest
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]  Jesus took initiative
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]  Jesus took initiative
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]  Jesus connected with different people
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]  和一個Samaritan woman
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  他用水去和她connect
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]  他關心人
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  He healed the leper
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]  He touched the leper
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]  He healed the sick
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]  Jesus was vulnerable
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]  他和門徒說,我是很有sadness
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]  他和門徒說,Be open, be vulnerable
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  然後耶穌分享了自己
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]  This is my prayer to you
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  這個是我的祈禱
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  You will get to know God more
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]  You will understand yourself
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]  And become more like God
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  You can be a real friend like Jesus
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]  Jesus is the real friend
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]  耶穌是最好的朋友
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  他是我們的最好的例子
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]  Let us pray
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  God help us to become more like you
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  To become a real friend
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  So that we can share you with others
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  In Christ's name we pray, Amen
