[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.800]   My name is Michelle, and I'm really excited tonight because it's the first time that I'm
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.080]   preaching after we've been back and are able to meet together.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.920]   So I'm just very excited.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.200]   And today we're on the topic of a prayer-centered church.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.600]   Yeah, just at the back, could I have a bit of light here?
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.760]   I really can't see my script.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.560]   So the very first scripture that we're reading is actually already read by Bonnie today.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.920]   And basically what we see is that the church, the early church devoted themselves to the
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.400]   teachings of the apostles.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.680]   And yes, I know it's not as fast as God making light here, but it's okay.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.080]   Don't worry.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   Whatever we'll make do.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.680]   So what we see is that the early Christians, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.240]   They were in fellowship.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.280]   They were breaking bread and they were praying together.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.920]   And so when they did that, oh wait, I can actually go without my mask.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420]   Don't worry, I've done my rad test.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.440]   So what happened is that after they've gathered and have prayed, the Lord has added their
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.880]   numbers daily, those who are being saved.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.600]   And so today we really want to look at what it means to be a prayer-centered church.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.560]   Do you think our church is a prayer-centered church?
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560]   Yeah, okay.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.200]   You're like, "I don't know if we are."
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.320]   But yes, and we want to look further today about what that looks like.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.360]   And sometimes we feel like we can just pray individually at home.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.960]   We don't necessarily have to pray together in one place at one time.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.480]   But today we're going to look at what really happens when we do do that, to come together,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.940]   pray at the same time, in the same place, and how the Lord will move in this place.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.360]   So first off, I want to share a Bible passage from the book of, we've already read that,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.760]   the book of Acts in chapter 12.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.480]   So at that time in this chapter, King Harold had just beheaded James, the brother of John.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.240]   Now because the Jews had delighted it so much that he decided, King Harold, that he's going
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.480]   to capture Apostle Peter and put him in prison.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.920]   And so as he did that, the people knew that the next day he would be trialed.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.040]   So the early church, the Christians came together and they said, "We have to pray for Peter."
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.360]   And so they prayed together.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   And Peter, when he was actually bound by chains to two soldiers, all of a sudden he saw an
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.640]   angel of the Lord appeared.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.280]   And the Lord instructed him, "Come, let's go."
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.700]   And even as he was leaving the prison, he thought he was in a vision.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.040]   Even he himself didn't believe it.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.680]   Until he got out of the prison, that's when he realized, "Oh, this is real.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.160]   I am out of the prison."
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.560]   And so he ran straight to the house of Mary where all the Christians had gathered.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   And you know what he did?
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.520]   He knocked on the door, right?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.120]   And then a servant girl answered.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.960]   And this is what happened.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.760]   And we can see it in verse 14 here.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.840]   When she, Ronda, which is the servant girl, recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.560]   that she ran back without opening the door.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   Okay?
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.760]   So you answer the door, but you don't open it.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.280]   And then she ran back and she exclaimed to everyone, "Peter's at the door."
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.360]   And then everybody says, "You're out of your mind."
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.680]   That can't be true.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.020]   But she insists, "No, he's really there."
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.120]   So he says, "It might be an angel.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.240]   It might be his angel."
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.000]   But when Peter kept on knocking and they finally opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   "It is Peter.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.200]   He is standing right there."
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.040]   So this brings us to our first point, that a prayer-centered church brings unity and
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   faith.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.720]   Now, we saw this in Acts chapter 12, that people saw a need.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.920]   There was an urgent need because Peter might be trialed the next day and he could be beheaded
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.440]   just like James.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.720]   So if he doesn't come out today or tomorrow, he's probably going to be dead.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.280]   And so the church gathered together, not for their own individual needs or desire at that
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.920]   time, but they came together for the need of a brother, for someone within the congregation,
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.440]   someone that they loved, and for the kingdom of God.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.320]   So when we pray together, it's actually going to bring us unity to God's heart and what
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.440]   he wants us to do.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.920]   And as they prayed together, they were exercising their faith.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.960]   Now I could see from the scripture, they weren't quite sure what God would do.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.000]   Maybe they had a little bit of faith.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.260]   Okay, maybe God will do something.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.740]   Maybe when the sword comes down, it won't chop his head off or something.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.040]   But somehow they were not expecting him to be standing at the door.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.080]   But you see when we pray together, our faith will grow because it no longer is an individual
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.840]   experience, but it's a corporate experience.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.800]   Can you imagine if today we were all praying together, I don't know, for someone to show
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.320]   up at the door and that person actually showed up, got out of prison and is standing right
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   there.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.400]   Can you imagine our level of faith would grow?
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.040]   I mean, even just hearing it, let's say someone didn't come and they've missed it.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.480]   And even when we have told them, their faith might not be the same as when we had experienced
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.320]   it together.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:24.680]   And so as a prayer-centered church, we need to come together to pray, not necessarily
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.440]   for ourselves, we can, but more so for the heart of God, to align ourselves there.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.720]   And when we experience him, it will bring us to a new level of faith.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.260]   Now last Friday night, we had a refresh night.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.240]   Now for those of you who have never been to one or don't know what it is, well, it's a
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.120]   night where we come together, we worship God and we pray together.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.320]   And I still remember when we were singing in that time, I just felt like I started to
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:01.720]   forget all the busyness of life and I start to forget the things that were on my mind
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.000]   or the things that were troubling me.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.320]   And as we were singing, I really felt that we were just looking towards God and trying
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.720]   to receive what his heart was.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.040]   And in that evening, we had another time where we actually prayed in groups of two to about
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.680]   five people.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.400]   And we prayed for a number of things.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.560]   I mean, it's too small for all of you.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.640]   It's too small for myself as well.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.720]   But there was a list of things that we prayed for.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.960]   We prayed for each other.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.620]   We've prayed for the community.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:42.020]   We prayed for a church to be growing in his words and to be towards his kingdom.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.960]   And we also prayed for the world where we pray for leaders and those who are being oppressed
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.440]   or in war.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.360]   And I still remember, as different people were praying, I realized they use words that
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.200]   I might not use.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.760]   And they have certain passion that I might not have in that area.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.900]   Or they may have set things in a way that I didn't know that we would pray like that.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:13.600]   And I felt like as I was agreeing with them and saying, "Amen," they were bringing me
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.160]   to a kind of prayer that I wouldn't be able to do if I were by myself.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.820]   And the prayer meeting felt very short, even though I think it was close to two hours.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.200]   And I just think that it was a time where we set aside everything.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.120]   We go to God, and that's where his heart is.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.640]   So, and I remember we prayed for the church where our community would grow closer together
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.300]   and deeper together.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:45.800]   And so I felt like the next day, which is a Saturday, that's where we met in service.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.600]   And a whole bunch of us went down for the buffet dinner.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.200]   Okay, who went last Saturday?
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.920]   Woo, yeah.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   I mean, we had...
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   I mean, if we're gonna cheer, let's really cheer, okay?
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   Woo!
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.080]   Okay, so we had 72 people who went for the dinner.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.240]   And we wanted to have more people to go, but we had a wait list.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.920]   I think we end up accommodating everybody.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.960]   But I mean, to my surprise, there were so many people, and not only the number of people,
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.040]   but the depth of the conversation.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.840]   Of course, I didn't get to eavesdrop everybody's conversation.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.200]   But just seeing the amount of engagement, yeah, you should be able to find yourself
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   there.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.720]   Just the amount of engagement we had.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.540]   It was like beyond what I had imagined or hoped.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:43.160]   And I felt like because the night before we did pray, and that has played a part for us
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.440]   to really come closer together.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.480]   And so I just wanna encourage all of us that as a prayer-centered church...
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.840]   Okay, I know, don't start being hungry, okay?
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.680]   I know there's a lot of food here.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.560]   Try to come back.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:04.920]   As we are a prayer-centered church, let us remember that we can pray together for someone
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:11.440]   who's in need, for those that are around us, or for the world.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:20.240]   Now the second thing that I do wanna share is another scripture.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:27.080]   The second scripture that I want to share with you is from James chapter 5.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.740]   And it says here in verse 13, "Is anyone among you in trouble?
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.860]   Let them pray.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.440]   Is anyone happy?
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.500]   Let them sing songs of praise.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.480]   Is anyone among you sick?
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.280]   Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.800]   the name of the Lord.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.480]   And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.440]   The Lord will raise them up.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.320]   If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.080]   Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.240]   healed.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.080]   The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective."
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.580]   Now at first glance at this passage, we might think, "Okay, I think the Bible's asking us
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.880]   to reach out to someone and pray for us.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.840]   Maybe the elders, the leaders, because they're more spiritual."
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.460]   But actually at a closer glance, this is not what the passage is about.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:33.200]   What the passage is about is for us to become authentic and vulnerable to each other, especially
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.880]   through confessing our sins and praying for one another.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880]   Now how do we know that?
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:46.600]   Well, because in verse 13, it tells us that rather you're happy or suffering or you're
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:54.000]   sick, find someone, rejoice with them or ask them to pray with you.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.760]   That's what we need to do as a prayer-centered church.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.320]   But this really is trying to tell us that it's not the people, that particular person
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:11.600]   we don't find, "Oh, Pastor John, Sandra, pray for me because your prayers are more powerful."
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   It's not like that because the verse says that it's the prayers that are lifted in faith.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.040]   That's what makes it powerful.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.080]   And so as we read, though, we don't quite understand.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.480]   All of a sudden it talks about sins and how when we pray for each other, sin seems to
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   be forgiven.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.680]   I mean, what's that all about?
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.680]   I thought we're just asking to be prayed for.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.200]   Why are there sins involved now?
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:46.760]   Now what we see here is that this passage is really asking us to do a little bit more
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.480]   than just asking for prayer.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.560]   It's asking us to confess our sins.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.680]   Now we don't do that very often, do we?
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.640]   We don't go to someone and say, "Hey, Nick, I want to confess my sins to you."
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.640]   Why?
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.880]   Because we feel like all we need to do when we have sinned against someone, what do we
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880]   do?
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.480]   We feel like we just tell God about it and we might, if we're brave enough, go to the
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.800]   person and ask for forgiveness.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:21.720]   But in here, the passage does not say, "Go to the person and ask them for forgiveness."
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.960]   There's another passage for that.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.800]   Here it says, "Tell someone the sins that you have committed."
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.520]   Now how often do we do that?
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.560]   Pretty much not at all, if we do it at all.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   Why?
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.720]   Well, you know, we come to church, what do we want to display?
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.840]   The best version of us, right?
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   Even if it's not the best version, it's the version that we want to display to other people.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.160]   I don't want to tell you what I did yesterday, like yelling at someone.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.440]   No, you don't want to know that.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   We just want to give the best version.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.160]   I mean, the best we can do is maybe during our clan or our prayer group, we might say,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.080]   "Oh yeah, work's been really busy.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.880]   Yeah, I've been suffering with ... I've been like, there were too much assignments," or
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   things like that.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.300]   We try to keep it kind of to the surface.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.840]   Now for some of us who are a little bit braver, we're going to share a little bit deeper,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   okay?
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.760]   "Oh, I'm having some struggle in this relationship," or like, "Oh, my coworkers, they're driving
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.880]   me crazy," right?
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:35.240]   So what we find that we do most of the time though in our prayer group is we're complaining.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.360]   Well, I mean, at least I am.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.960]   Who's guilty of it?
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   Don't put up your hand.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   Okay, okay, put up your hand.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   Great, great, great.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.440]   I mean, I might be the only one guilty.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   No, of course not.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   We're all guilty.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440]   What do we do?
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.560]   We're like, "Oh, you know that person, you can't believe it.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.000]   You know he did that again.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.960]   Oh, you know my husband didn't listen to me and he doesn't care about me.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.520]   Oh, my wife, you know, she's controlling me again.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.840]   I mean again."
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.160]   And then you talk about your boss, right?
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.280]   Of course my boss is unfair.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.280]   When is he ever fair, right?
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.760]   Oh, right, except my boss.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:17.600]   Except my boss.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.920]   And so, you know, what we hear is all this grumbling.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.400]   So when we're in small groups, that's all we hear.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.160]   And then the next thing is, "Pray for me."
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.000]   Okay, I'll pray for you.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.640]   And you know, when we say these things, what does it really do to us?
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:44.120]   Really, it lifts us up and it puts down the person that we've talked about.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:51.040]   That's what it does, which is why the Bible does not say, "Come together and let's complain
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.240]   and then pray for each other."
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.720]   It says, "Confess our sins and pray for each other."
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   And what does that mean?
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.280]   I mean, can you imagine if we come together and said, "You know what?
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.520]   I'm going to call.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   Pray for me.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.080]   I've been so selfish, you know?
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.960]   I've been so selfish.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.840]   All I ever think about is how bad my husband has been to me or like how my wife has been
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   nagging me."
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.640]   Okay, I'm not talking about you.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.320]   I mean, can you imagine if we go to someone, "Pray for me.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   I've been so selfish.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   Pray for me.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.480]   I've been so prideful.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.880]   I kept on thinking how much better I am than my co-worker or somebody at school.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.200]   Pray for me because I've not been appreciating my parents.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.560]   I just find them to be annoying.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.360]   Can you pray for me?"
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:52.120]   Or for those people who think maybe there are situations where you have done nothing
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.000]   wrong, right?
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.880]   And can you pray for me because I can't forgive this person who has hurt me?
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.880]   Can you pray for me?
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.040]   I can't love my enemy.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.320]   I always think, you know, what if we prayed like that?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.400]   Well, according to the Bible, God's going to heal us.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:20.640]   And according to this passage, the prayer of the righteous one is powerful and effective.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.400]   Maybe the reason that our prayers haven't been that powerful and effective is because
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.160]   we haven't done what it says.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:33.640]   We haven't confessed our sins because most of the time we're on the other side, right?
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:40.000]   And so sometimes I imagine, you know, if God looked down and there were two churches, okay?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.520]   There's one that grumbles, complains, and is never satisfied.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.380]   And then there's this other one that just keeps on praying, "Help me, God.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.560]   I want to value others more than myself.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.640]   I want to love those that I find hard to love."
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.120]   What will that look like?
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:08.240]   I think we'll be healed of our sickness, our situations would turn around, and life would
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.000]   never be the same again, and God will open doors.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:24.680]   I want to share with you that as a prayer-centered church, we need to confess our sins to each
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.280]   other, not necessarily the person that you've sinned against.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.560]   And now that's not to say, you know, come up and get the microphone and start telling
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.600]   everybody you've robbed the bank yesterday, right?
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.600]   No.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.840]   But find the trusted people.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   Tell them.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.480]   Let them pray for you.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.240]   Be transformed in the process.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.240]   Pray for one another.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.200]   And we will see that God will heal us.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:01.160]   And in 2 Chronicles 7, 14 to 15, it says, "If my people who are called by my name will
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.680]   humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.720]   hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:22.800]   Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place."
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:32.680]   Can you imagine how much more God will do and would do for us if we did what the Scripture
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.920]   said?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.880]   Let us be this prayer sent to church starting today, you know, next time we have Klan, next
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.720]   time we have small group, practice it.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.520]   Now I just want to make a note, you know, that's not to say we can't share some of our
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.960]   emotions or anguish that we have.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.700]   We can, but don't stay there.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.080]   Go to the next step.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.040]   Yeah, maybe you're very angry at someone and we don't want to suppress it, but after you
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.160]   express that, you know, go to the next step, confess our sins with each other and pray
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.560]   for one another.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:15.560]   Now the third passage that I do want to share before we get here, I know you guys start
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.600]   reading once I turn the page.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:24.520]   So the third passage I want to share with you is from 1 Samuel, chapter 1.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.760]   Now there was a certain man named Okana who has two wives.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.560]   One bears children and the other one does not, and the other one is called Hana.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.880]   And so she was constantly being provoked by the wife that has children.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.040]   And so year after year she would pray, "Oh Lord, you know, give me a child, give me a
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   child."
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.200]   But the Lord did not open her womb so she did not have children.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.520]   And so at this time when they were making sacrifices to the Lord, Hana was praying in
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.420]   her heart again, just asking God to give her a child.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:08.760]   And so because she was mumbling and crying, then the priest Eli thought that she was drunk.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.360]   And so this is how she replied to him.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.280]   "Not so, my Lord," Hana replied.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.880]   "I am a woman who is deeply troubled.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.680]   I've not been drinking wine or beer.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.520]   I was pouring out my soul to the Lord.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.480]   Do not take your servant for a wicked woman.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:33.920]   I've been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:41.640]   Eli answered, "Go in peace and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked Him."
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.160]   And she said, is it still here?
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.320]   Okay.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.720]   And she said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes."
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.760]   Then she went her way and ate something and her face was no longer downcast.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:02.720]   Now in this story, it really tells us that there will be times when we've prayed for
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.760]   something for a very long time.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.880]   I mean, long is very subjective.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.520]   Some of us, two days is very long.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.320]   For others, months are very long.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.120]   And for others, years are very long.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:26.000]   And so we just become sorrowful and even to the point of despair because the Lord is just
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.880]   seem like He's not doing anything.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.400]   And I've actually heard people, maybe including myself at some point too, just felt like I
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.000]   want to die.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.280]   Why?
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:42.120]   Because I've been waiting for some significant person to appear in my life and it hasn't
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.720]   happened yet for the last 20 years, you know?
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.260]   And you know, we do get discouraged, right?
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:54.500]   Or there's this dream job that I've been trying to go to and just get there, but all the doors
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.920]   have been shut like forever, as tight as it can be.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:04.200]   Or someone really wants a child and haven't had the chance to get that yet.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.120]   Or a sickness or something else.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.200]   And we just pray and pray and pray.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.640]   And what do we do?
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:20.440]   When we are alone doing that, we get despair to a point where we might not even want to
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.280]   live on.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:31.560]   And so our third point is that as a prayer-centered church, we need to encourage one another.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.640]   Notice that when Hannah was praying by herself, she was downcast.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:43.600]   But the moment that the priest, Eli, told her, "May the Lord grant you what you have
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.280]   asked for," she was again lifted up.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   She was enlightened.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.860]   She's like, "Yes, I remember the Lord."
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:58.680]   And so the Lord opened up her womb and she was able to conceive and she had a son called
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.360]   Samuel.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.860]   And so what we see here is we should not be doing this on our own.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.040]   We need to be encouraged and we need to encourage one another.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.500]   We need to tell the person, "Keep going.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.000]   Lord loves you and he's going to grant you what you want."
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.600]   Now we might say, "What if he never does?"
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.000]   That's not the point.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.360]   The point is, do you have faith to go on?
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:30.440]   Do you have faith that even if he doesn't, that he will give you whatever it is that
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.180]   is best for you?
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:38.240]   And so when we pray, I mean, even when Hannah, when she was no longer downcast and she ate
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.040]   the food, she doesn't know if she's going to get a baby or not, right?
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:50.400]   But because of that encouragement, she was able to press on just to go a little further.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.480]   Sometimes I've seen on Facebook, there's like a little picture.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:01.200]   Well, there's many pictures, but this particular one that I saw where there were two diamond
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.960]   diggers, have you seen that one?
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.200]   There was one on top, one at the bottom, and they dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.600]   And then we see that the diamonds are only inches away for both of them.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.220]   And one person decides to leave and the other one kept on going.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.440]   And sometimes I feel like when we encourage one another, it might just be that another
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.840]   inch to go.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:29.720]   And then we will see the Lord delivering us, just like Hannah right here.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.840]   So I really pray that, you know, hope that we become a prayer-centered church.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.280]   Let us encourage one another.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.800]   And I mean, for some of you who might know that my mother has been fighting lung cancer
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.400]   for some time now, it's been three years since the relapse of cancer.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   She's right here.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   Hello, mommy.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   I love you.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:26:01.120]   And for the last year and a half, her cancer index has started to climb from 2.0 or 2.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.360]   something, 3, 3.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.920]   something, 4, and then it kept going.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.680]   And then two months ago, it was at 16.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.720]   Okay.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   And it was definitely not the direction that we wanted to go at all.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.160]   And honestly, each month I have to tell you when I go with her and the numbers go up,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.800]   you know, I mean, we all pretend it's okay.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.400]   You know, everything's going to be fine.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.200]   But there's all this turmoil that's just going inside.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.460]   We keep on thinking, oh my goodness, like, how's this going to end?
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.200]   But we just kept on praying.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   And you know, I told my clan, like my small group about it.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.440]   And I told many of you that asked about it.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.520]   And I was so glad that I didn't have to walk through it alone.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.200]   Because there were so many of you that would come to me and say, "Hey, how's your mom?
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.800]   I've been praying for her."
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.840]   And you know, for me, that was such great encouragement.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.720]   I bring that back to my mom and I say, "Hey, you know, so and so have been praying for
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   you."
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   And she's like, "Who's that?"
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.800]   So I have to explain, oh, you know, that person is that person's that person.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.920]   But never mind.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.120]   What it was, it gave us encouragement.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:17.000]   It felt like, you know, we weren't alone and we were loved by many of you, all of you actually.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.960]   And actually, just to tell you the good news is, last month, we started a new drug for
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.000]   her.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.240]   And after using it for one month's time only, her cancer index has dropped from 16 all the
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.200]   way to 7 in just one month's time.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.440]   Yes.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.280]   It was like one of the best gifts that God gave us.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.560]   And not only that, did you know that this drug, how much it cost?
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.200]   Three, oh, no, I did it wrong.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.240]   $36,000 a month.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.920]   And that's only at the public hospital.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:05.120]   So if you get it at the private, it's $60,000 a month.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   Okay.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.240]   And because of the prayers, because of the grace of God, because we were connected, because
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:19.000]   we told people about it, we were able to source it at the same manufacturer, the same drug,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.360]   same effect, because it is the same drug, for $7,000 a month.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.520]   And I just want to let you know that God is here.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:42.640]   And when we pray, maybe it's days, maybe it's weeks has gone by, but keep praying, because
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.920]   God will deliver us.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.160]   God will deliver us.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.480]   But don't do it alone.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:54.280]   I don't think it would have been quite the same journey if I were the only one who prayed
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.040]   with my mom privately about this.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:04.160]   But I do believe, because all of your prayers and all of your love for us helped us in the
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   process, and God listened to all our prayers.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.440]   And so I want to encourage you, and I'm actually encouraging myself too, that prayer is not
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.920]   something like, "Oh, we do because the Bible tells us to."
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.800]   It's something powerful.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.760]   It's meant to heal your sickness.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.720]   It's meant to change the situation that you're in.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.640]   But don't do it alone.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:39.760]   Let us walk together, because there's power, and that's why God gave us this community
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.000]   to do it together.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:52.960]   And so now I just wanted to challenge you, challenge myself, to be a prayer-centered
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.080]   church.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.800]   And how do we do that?
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.360]   Really is to set aside some time, you know, when we have prayer meetings.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.160]   I'm not expecting 10% attendance next time.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.840]   I'm expecting 100% attendance.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:16.680]   Come, set aside that time, pray together, and let us see God's hand and what our faith
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   is going to change.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.480]   And at the same time, when you're in a small group, practice it each week, you know, going
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.200]   to your small group, confessing your sins.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.280]   "Oh my goodness, I was so prideful this week, you know, help me."
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:39.560]   And by confessing it, it's a real humble process, because we're no longer just thinking it in
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.280]   my head and still trying to pretend to be someone that got everything together, but
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   we're actually being authentic.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.520]   "Yeah, I got issues.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   I've got problems.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.920]   Can you help me pray?"
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.560]   It's a humbling process for us.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:31:00.000]   And the third thing really is just to be someone who encourages someone else and be open to
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.040]   be encouraged.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.760]   So this is what a prayer-centered church is about.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:13.280]   So now I actually want to invite all of you to turn to one or two people.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.120]   Okay, don't start moving yet, okay?
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.840]   I know this is like, you know, when we used to do high school project, right?
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   The moment we say get into groups, you're like, "Oh, who am I going to be with?"
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.960]   But just hold on.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.000]   Is what we want to do really is just spend a moment, you know, maybe three to five minutes
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.500]   where we pray to become this prayer-centered church, okay?
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.060]   Pray that we'll set aside time and grow in our faith.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.040]   Pray that we can be bold enough to confess our sins.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:49.360]   We're humble enough to go to the people that we love and say, "I can't do this.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.360]   I messed up."
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:58.380]   And then pray that we can encourage and be someone that allows others to encourage us.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:04.480]   So now we'll have a few minutes and then I'll come back up to do a rapid prayer and our
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.360]   worship team will lead us into a response song in just a moment.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.060]   Yeah, so gather in two people or three people.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:18.180]   And for those of you who are online joining us, if there's someone next to you, please
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.240]   pray with them.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   If not, pray in your heart as well.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:31.420]   [Praying in Tongues]
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   [Music]
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:45.780]   [Music]

[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   [Music]
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.500]   Let us pray together.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:14.500]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for giving us Jesus.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.500]   And we thank you that you've given us the church.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.500]   It's not a building.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   It's not a place that we go to.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:33.820]   But it's full of your people, the people that loves you, the people that you love, the people
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.980]   that are full of your spirit.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:45.700]   And we pray, Father, that as we learn and continue to grow to be this prayer-centered
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:51.500]   church, that, Father, your spirit continues to guide us.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.220]   How do we have the right attitude?
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:00.300]   How do we have the right habits so that we are aligned with your heart?
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   We know that you love the church and that you've prepared him for Jesus and for his
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.300]   return.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   We're meant to be his bride.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:16.140]   And so, Father, we just pray that you'll continue to guide us, to help us, so that we can know
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:23.700]   your heart and be the kind of Christians that you have created us to be.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.140]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:26.980]   Amen.
