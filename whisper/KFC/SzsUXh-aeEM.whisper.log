[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.560]   One day I was invited to the Chinese International School in Fremont Hill.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.440]   It was billed as their religion day.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:27.020]   Also invited were a Catholic priest, a Buddhist monk, and a Jewish rabbi.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.640]   We all had the opportunity to address the pupils.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.080]   And this was followed by a series of questions and answers.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.420]   The very last question was this.
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.420]   How does your religion differ from all the others?
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.040]   My fellow panelists all gave a similar answer, albeit dressed in a slightly different format.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.700]   Basically what they were saying is that we are all the same and it is just a different
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.320]   way of expressing it.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.140]   I was the last to answer.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:23.200]   I said, I can see where my colleagues are coming from, but sadly I cannot agree with
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.960]   that answer.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.740]   For in Christianity we have this thing called grace, G-R-A-C-E, God's riches at Christ's
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.800]   expense.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:48.080]   In fact I said that Christianity is not so much a religion as a relationship.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:58.180]   It's not about us trying to reach God by good works and devotion, but instead God reaching
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.160]   us through the death of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.180]   Suffice to say I was not invited back the next year.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.440]   We are in the eighth week of our series, Don't Give the Enemy a Seat at Your Table.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.220]   We've been looking at the dangers of exposing our lives to the evil one, giving him an inch
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.280]   and watching him take a mile.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:41.960]   We have looked at his deadly lies exposed, the spiral of sin and taking every thought
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   captive.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.160]   We've been speaking about denying the enemy.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.520]   But what happens if you give the enemy a seat at your table?
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.080]   Acting, chin, can you be the enemy for a minute?
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   Can you just sit down?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.760]   Give him a round of applause.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.280]   Nothing personal.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.460]   What happens if you give the enemy a seat at your table anyway?
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.360]   Is that curtains?
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.200]   The end of our series, finito?
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.380]   And that's where my CIS answer comes in.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.160]   The answer is simple.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.120]   No.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.640]   The essence of the gospel is that God forgives sins through Jesus Christ and makes you new.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.400]   But there is a requirement.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   Confession.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.360]   Confession when you repent, God wipes out your sins.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:16.320]   God forgives you and cleanses you and God ejects the devil from your table.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.120]   Thank you.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.640]   Look at this, Proverbs 28, 13.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:32.960]   Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.000]   them will obtain mercy.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:51.760]   Yet you know, even after we confess our sins, two things often linger.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:03.160]   Those two things are guilt and shame.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.880]   Guilt and shame.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.760]   Often they get lumped together, but they're actually very different.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.000]   Guilt is the position of being accountable for sins and shortcoming.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.160]   It's a legal term that points to remorse.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.360]   We get examples of it when we have our courts with the judge.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.280]   I remember a few years ago, it was my birthday.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.600]   Sandra remember this?
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.160]   You didn't tell me where we were going, do you remember?
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.520]   And I was driving the car and I was actually just here going up towards Cotton Tree Drive
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.280]   and a policeman stopped me.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.680]   He said, "You are guilty of careless driving."
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.640]   Careless driving me?
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.160]   Anyway, I get a letter through the post.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.760]   I had to go to court.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.800]   The judge was there.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.200]   Have you anything to say before I give sentence?
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.940]   No.
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.160]   So what I got was points and a fine.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.040]   I was guilty.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:30.000]   And yet in spiritual terms, you've given the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:41.660]   Fear, pride, anxiety, lust, a lack of trust.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.080]   The gavel comes down, the verdict comes in.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:56.800]   You've fallen short of the glory of God and yes, you are responsible for it.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.040]   You are guilty.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:11.080]   Shame on the other hand, is the feeling of being defined by your sin and shortcomings.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:22.080]   Shame acknowledges guilt, yet somehow intertwines the sin with your identity.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.200]   Guilt is a legal and spiritual state.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.080]   Shame is an emotional and mental state.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.040]   In guilt, you admit you did something wrong.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.640]   I have done something wrong.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.560]   I have fought something bad.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:55.200]   In shame, you take the sin upon yourself and you say, I am something wrong.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.720]   I am bad.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:08.880]   Even though they are separate, guilt and shame have the same solution.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.600]   And I need to tell you this tonight.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:24.680]   The pathway to freedom from both guilt and shame is the story of grace.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:31.600]   Spiritual justice has a social framework and restitution.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.960]   That's how I got my 12 points, or where I was on my license and my fine.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:46.320]   Yet the ultimate solution is always the grace of God.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:53.560]   There are many people in this room, many people listening online, who are walking around like
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.800]   this.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:08.320]   You're walking around and you're carrying the weight of guilt and shame.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:17.480]   It prevents us from walking in the freedom purchased for us at the cross.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:25.200]   My friends, it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.080]   We can have victory.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.520]   I love this expression.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.640]   I'll put it on the screen.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.680]   The grit, the grit of grace.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:47.380]   The pathway of freedom is open to all people in the covering of grace.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.920]   But it's not airy fairy or flimsy.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.420]   Grace has grit, backbone and muscle.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.760]   You remember the film True Grit with John Wayne.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.840]   There's nothing airy fairy about John Wayne, I tell you.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.580]   Shane once said, "Grace is the left hook that destroys the power of sin."
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:26.860]   Firstly, let's see how grace destroys shame.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.660]   Shame is a powerfully destructive force.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.660]   It causes you to feel as if you're unworthy of God's love, unworthy of God's acceptance,
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.740]   purposes and plans.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:51.900]   Shame causes us to feel so marred, so strongly that we feel damaged beyond repair.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:57.900]   When you feel shame, you're always trying to hide.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:09.500]   You try and hide from God behind denial or by trying to keep out of his way.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.620]   Or you hide from people.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:21.580]   You hide behind layers, walls, titles, accomplishments or in Hong Kong, especially busyness.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.620]   You don't want anyone to know you.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:31.300]   So you keep people away at arm's length.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:37.940]   Or you don't want people to know what happened to you.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:45.220]   Shame imprisons you and me to the past.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:52.140]   How very telling that when God created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, we read in
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:12:04.300]   Genesis 2.25, "And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.580]   Everything that God created was described as good and being naked and unashamed was
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.860]   part of the goodness of paradise.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.100]   Yes, the garden was beautiful.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.300]   Yes, there were plants and food and animals.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.060]   Everything was in perfect condition.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:38.180]   Note that the ultimate description of goodness in paradise was a lack of shame.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.260]   The Hebrew word for this was al-min.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:50.140]   It means naked and unashamed.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.580]   Then came the fall.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:02.060]   Adam and Eve made disastrous decisions that resulted in huge consequences.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:07.460]   Earth broke apart as a result of their choices.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:17.980]   And both guilt and shame entered into this story and into ours too.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:23.660]   One minute, Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:32.640]   The next minute, they were hiding from God, trying to cover themselves with fig leaves.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.200]   They had exchanged the al-min, naked and unashamed, for al-rum.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.700]   Notice the play here on Hebrew words.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:54.260]   Al-min, al-rum, and al-rum means deceitfulness, guilt, and shame.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:01.500]   However, back in the garden, God formed a rescue plan.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:08.060]   With Adam and Eve, he clothed the two humans in garments of animal skin that he'd made
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.260]   for them.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.620]   But what God did was this.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:19.020]   He pointed to the future and to the cross of Jesus.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:27.940]   When the serpent, representing Satan, would harm Jesus by striking his heel.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.980]   But Jesus would gain full victory by crushing the serpent's head.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.980]   Let's read it.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:39.300]   "I will put enmity between you," that's the serpent, "and the woman, and between your
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.180]   offspring and her offspring.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:48.220]   He will bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel."
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:56.340]   In other words, God would destroy sin and death and fully reconnect people to the purposes
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.780]   and the personhood of God.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:14.100]   Thanks to the work of Jesus on the cross, you and I can live free from shame.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:20.660]   My friends, don't let that truth pass you by.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.140]   Shame does not need to be part of your story.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:30.780]   We'll talk more about this in a little bit.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:41.260]   Second, let's look at how grace is also the solution to guilt.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:47.180]   The grace of God moves into your story and through the work of Jesus on the cross, the
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:55.620]   grace of God cancels your spiritual guilt and sets you free.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.780]   Grace positions you rightly before God.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:10.340]   Yes, there is a penalty to be paid for wrongdoings.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:19.020]   Yet Jesus has already taken that penalty, the penalty of sin for you.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.420]   Jesus has set you free.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:31.220]   We see hints of the grace that you and I did enjoy today, even in the Old Testament.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:37.620]   Go to Isaiah 6, it records the prophet Isaiah seeing a vision of the Lord and a vision of
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.620]   heaven.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.700]   It was a beautiful and powerful vision.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:50.460]   And when he saw this vision, Isaiah did not say, "Wow, that's cool."
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.900]   Look at Isaiah 6, verse 5.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:59.620]   I said, "Woe is me, for I am lost.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:06.060]   For I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:12.380]   For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.060]   Isaiah felt completely shattered before God.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:24.700]   He instantly saw the gap between who he was and who God is.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:32.340]   Isaiah's response points us to the finished work of Jesus on the cross.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:38.340]   You can step up to that finished work by the act of repentance.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.060]   When you say the equivalent of Isaiah's words, "Woe is me.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.020]   I've fallen short of God's holy standard.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.140]   I've fallen short of God's best for my life.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.300]   I take responsibility for it.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.420]   I am accountable for my sin.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.660]   Whether or not I admit it or respond emotionally."
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:04.580]   Repentance is not a negative thing.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:11.940]   Your act of admitting guilt opens a doorway called grace.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.780]   And God comes to you through that doorway.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:22.900]   It does for you what none of us can do for ourselves.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.220]   Grace was what was extended to Isaiah.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:38.580]   The great news is that verses six and seven tell of an angel who flew to Isaiah with a
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.220]   burning coal in his hand.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.300]   Let's read verse six.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:53.620]   Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.700]   with tongs from the altar.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.100]   Isaiah expected to be exterminated.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:13.460]   He takes one look at the burning coal and thinks, "That's it, I'm toast."
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:24.540]   Instead, the angel touched Isaiah's mouth and said this.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:30.980]   And he touched my mouth and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.540]   Your guilt is taken away.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.820]   Your sin is atoned for."
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:48.100]   When we fast forward the story to the New Testament, we see another live burning coal
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:57.780]   has come down from heaven, the Holy One of God, Jesus Christ.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:09.500]   He gave his innocent life and took our guilt on Calvary's Hill.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:21.500]   Through his death, his burial, and his resurrection comes our freedom.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.140]   Jesus was pure and innocent.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:34.220]   And on the cross, a great exchange took place in heaven's courtroom.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:44.060]   You and I were guilty of our sins and our shortcoming, but God took our guilt and placed
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:51.820]   it instead on his innocent and righteous and willing son.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:21:03.580]   But then God took the innocence and the righteousness of his son and made it available to us.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:16.620]   To everyone who repents, God proclaims forgiveness in the same way that the seraph said to Isaiah,
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:22.300]   your guilt is taken away, your sin is atoned for.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:28.020]   You are set free by a holy, righteous God.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:33.100]   All your guilt is taken by Jesus.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:38.500]   You are made brand new.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:44.900]   I love 1 John 1.9.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:55.340]   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.500]   from all unrighteousness.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.980]   Now John was actually addressing the new believers here, helping them understand the power of
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.180]   the gospel.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.340]   And he wrote this.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.660]   What it means is your acts of confession is vitally important.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:20.620]   When you confess, you admit you are responsible for sin in your life.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:28.600]   You are saying, I did it and it was wrong.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.300]   But here is the biggest news of all.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:41.700]   If you do sin as a Christian, confess your sin to clear the air in your fellowship with
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.540]   God.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.580]   Because of the cross, you are already forgiven.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:54.900]   Jesus is not coming back to the cross and dying again.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.940]   It is finished, remember?
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:07.060]   So you say, Father, I'm sorry I've sinned.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:13.200]   Thank you that I am forgiven.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:22.780]   I want you to give me the grace and power to walk in a different direction.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:30.080]   So what you do is you confess both your sin and his forgiveness.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.900]   Now that's a reason to celebrate.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:42.080]   Yet I need to tell you, the enemy will not go quietly on this one.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:50.600]   He will do all he can to keep you on a guilt trip indefinitely.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.960]   Do you recognize the voice of dread?
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.800]   Well, now I see you are a Christian.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.980]   I see you believe you're going to heaven when you die.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:13.360]   I'm going to make sure your life feels like hell right now by pointing out, pointing out
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.280]   to you everything that you've ever done that was wrong and everything that you're going
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.420]   to do in the future.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.420]   That's right.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.920]   I'm booking your tickets for a one-way cruise.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.200]   You're going on a guilt trip.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.720]   And I'm the captain of the ship, mister.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:42.860]   My friends, it's far too easy to jump on that cruise.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:50.400]   The enemy remembers everything and he'll bring back all the ugly details of your past life
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.640]   back to you.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:25:00.440]   He works hard to convince you that if you keep your sins hidden, all will be well.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:07.280]   If you just press those sins down hard enough, if you just party it up hard enough, that's
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.320]   what's needed to feel good.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.320]   But my friends, that doesn't work.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   Your guilt is never removed when you hide.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.400]   It is only when you bring your guilt into the spotlight of Christ's grace that your
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:35.520]   sins are atoned for and your guilt is removed.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:46.840]   In Jesus's holy, loving, and kind presence, you can say, "Lord, I confess I've done some
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.240]   things wrong.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:56.060]   I also want to let you know that I've had some wrong things done to me.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:01.240]   These things have made me marred, damaged, hurt.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.600]   I've been both a perpetrator of sin and a victim of sin.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:14.700]   I want your forgiveness and I want your freedom.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:23.680]   I want your eyes to see all that I have done and all that has been done to me."
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:31.300]   By your work, the effects of sin are canceled.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:38.840]   By your stripes, I am healed.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:49.900]   You see, grace not only cancels guilt and shame, but it also redefines you and me.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:27:00.200]   The biggest change in definition is from failure to family.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.500]   The author Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a book in 1850 called The Scarlet Letter.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.540]   You might have heard of it.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:16.860]   In the story, a young woman called Hester Pryne had a baby through an affair.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.240]   Hester is jailed for adultery.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   When the baby is about three months old, Hester is released from jail, her debt to society
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.140]   paid.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:39.560]   Yet in order to shame her permanently, the townspeople make Hester stand on a scaffold
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:47.260]   in the town square for three hours wearing a red cloth with a letter A stitched on the
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.260]   front of the dress.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:53.040]   You see, I put a picture on the screen.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:03.880]   The legacy of the public shaming will be the ongoing punishment.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:11.680]   For years afterwards, Hester is treated as an outcast.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   She is defined by what she has done.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:23.920]   Now maybe you can identify with that story because I'll be honest with you, many of you
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:31.040]   are walking around with a scarlet letter of your own.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.600]   You're defined by your sin.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.400]   You look at that letter on your chest, you say, "Yeah, that's me."
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:45.760]   Or maybe it was someone else's sin that God exported into your life, an abusive parent
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.880]   or spouse perhaps, the friends who rejected you.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:59.800]   And I'll be honest, as a pastor, I see so many people walking around this city with
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:08.620]   an R on their chest, the R for rejection.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:13.400]   Even then you look into the mirror and you say, "I'm damaged, I'm ruined."
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.640]   You take other people's failure and you wear it as your own.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:24.880]   But God changes your identity.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.600]   I love this, it's on the screen.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.120]   The enemy wants to define you by your scars.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.360]   Jesus wants to define you by his scars.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.840]   Can I say it again?
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.720]   I love it so much.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:48.120]   The enemy wants to define you by your scars.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.960]   Jesus wants to define you by his scars.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:01.920]   The grace of Jesus Christ removes your old identity and replaces it with a brand new
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.920]   identity.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:09.280]   1 John 3 says this, "See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.680]   be called children of God."
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.720]   And so we are.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:20.520]   The reason why the world does not know us is it did not know him.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.920]   This is your new identity.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:34.000]   You are a son or a daughter of God, a child of the King.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.640]   Sandra and I were updating our wills this week.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.240]   If you want to find out whether you're in it, just let us know.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.120]   But we've been updating our wills.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:49.560]   But I need to tell you, you are written into God's will.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:55.280]   You are an heir of everything that God has.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.520]   Grace has redefined you.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:08.160]   You are a beloved member of the family of God because you have been given a seat at
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.680]   his table.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.140]   Two years ago, you remember traveling?
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.160]   We took a team from KFCI to Israel.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:29.680]   And one of the places we visited was the beach where Jesus had gently restored the apostle
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   Peter.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.760]   I've put a picture of it up on the screen.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.600]   This is the actual beach where Jesus restored Peter.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:47.800]   Now in Peter's original commission, Jesus said, "Follow me and I will make you fishers
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   of men."
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   Remember that?
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   Matthew 4.19.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.840]   In other words, follow me because I have a plan and a purpose for your lives.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:02.720]   But Peter, of course, betrayed Jesus three times on the night before his death.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.080]   He had messed up.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.440]   He was a failure.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.520]   And so he returned to his old gig.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.720]   He ignored his new commission.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.000]   He'd gone fishing.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.300]   Oh yes, but fishing for fish again.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:30.800]   I think Peter knew he was wearing the identity of three-time betrayer on his chest.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:37.080]   He did not believe a three-time betrayer had any place in the plans and purposes of Jesus
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   anymore.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.600]   Have you ever been in a similar place?
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.520]   You've denied Jesus, so now you feel cloaked in shame.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:59.360]   Or you've ignored Jesus, forgotten Jesus, and now you're back to your old way of life.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.480]   You've sinned.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:06.560]   You've given the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.880]   When that happens, you go to a familiar place.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   Even though that familiar place isn't part of Jesus' call on your life, to a place you
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.800]   know and know only too well.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:29.440]   You go to a place that's easy to go to, but seldom beneficial.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:37.440]   It may not be a place of debauchery or gross sin, but merely a place where you think you
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.120]   can do life without God.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:48.800]   It is perhaps the grossest sin of all.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.640]   In a place like this, it's hard to believe you can ever be restored.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:02.480]   But as the day broke, there was some good news.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.460]   Day broke, Jesus stood on the shore.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.640]   He asked the disciples if they'd caught any fish.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.000]   He already knew the answer.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.600]   He asked them to throw their nets on the other side of the boat.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.960]   Man, we tried that already.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.600]   We're experienced fishermen, you know.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:30.000]   The difference was because Jesus was behind the declaration.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.380]   Fortunately, Peter and the other disciples followed Jesus' voice and their nets became
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.380]   instantly full.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.840]   We caught 153 fish.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:48.760]   Peter got so excited, he jumped into the sea and swam to land to see if it really was Jesus.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.480]   And there's me jumping into the sea.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.160]   Boom.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:00.680]   There's me jumping into the sea.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:07.320]   There is me jumping into the sea.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:30.080]   Can I have the next slide, please?
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.400]   I need to tell you why you're looking at this amazing picture.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.600]   That's Kathy, by the way.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:45.720]   How Jesus restored Peter is how Jesus restores us today.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:54.240]   I mean, he would have been justified in saying, "Hey, Peter, I heard you denied me three times.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.120]   Are you for real?
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.120]   I hate to be a told you so, but I told you so.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.360]   Why did you let me down at the most critical point of my mission?
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.480]   Are you even sorry?
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   You're worthless.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   You're a hypocrite.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   Get out of here."
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.600]   No, Jesus did not say that to Peter.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.160]   And he doesn't say anything like that to you and me.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.680]   He simply said to Peter, "Come and have breakfast.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.280]   Come close to me.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.640]   Get some warm baked bread.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.560]   Here's barbecued fish fresh off the grill.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.000]   I'll bet you're tired and wet.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.960]   Come by this warm fire.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:55.120]   Sit and rest a while and dry your damp clothes."
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:01.000]   What do you think Jesus will say to you when he takes you for breakfast?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.640]   Do you think it will be words of accusation?
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.480]   Certainly the enemy would like to put that into our minds.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:15.880]   Do you imagine that Jesus would say to you, "You're done for, finished."
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:23.280]   Yet Romans chapter eight says, "Yet there is therefore no condemnation for those who
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.720]   are in Christ Jesus."
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.120]   No condemnation.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.920]   Jesus gave us such a perfect picture of that verse in his dealings with Peter.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.240]   And Jesus offers us similar kindness.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.120]   After the meal, Jesus had some more kind words for Peter.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.360]   Jesus asked one question in three different ways.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.880]   Essentially, he said to Peter, "Do you love me?
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.080]   Do you love me more than these boats and nets and fish and these things you've given your
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.400]   life to but I called you away from?"
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:11.040]   When Peter affirmed his love for the Lord Jesus, Jesus replied, "Feed my sheep."
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:18.320]   Jesus did more for Peter and more for us than we can imagine.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.400]   Jesus was telling Peter he wasn't finished.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:30.000]   Peter was gonna be the rock on which the mission of God will be established and carried forward.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.040]   It said that his identity was not gonna be a denier of Jesus.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.620]   He would not have D sketched on his shirt.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.680]   He would be the hero of faith and a legend in the church.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.720]   Peter will one day very soon preach the gospel and the power of the Holy Spirit and 3000
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.000]   people will be saved that day.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.440]   Jesus never focused on Peter's failure.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   He focused on the restoration.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.080]   Grace removed Peter's guilt.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.040]   Grace removed Peter's shame.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.080]   Peter's identity was no longer wrapped up in the denial.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.640]   Yes, he'd failed.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:21.000]   He failed big time but his life wasn't a failure.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.160]   His life was no longer marked by shame.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:32.200]   Grace redefined Peter as a friend and a family member of the God Almighty.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:38.920]   And that's what the grace of God does for you and me too.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:48.560]   As I draw this to a close, one of my favorite verses in the whole Bible, Psalm 34, 5 says,
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:40:00.480]   "Those who look to him are radiant and their faces shall never be ashamed."
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.040]   Jesus says, "You are not damaged goods.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.680]   You are a child of the Almighty God, an heir to the King of the universe."
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:17.920]   When Jesus invites you to breakfast on the beach, He simply asks if you love Him.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:25.240]   If the answer is yes, Jesus proceeds with the restoration.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.720]   Now the enemy might wanna twist it.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.040]   He might wanna keep sitting at your table.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.200]   He wants you to listen to his voice looking away.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:43.780]   But the first in Psalms encourages us to look to the Lord and promises us, you will be radiant.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.080]   This is a powerful image and the opposite of shame.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.820]   If you are looking to the Lord, you are radiant.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.040]   Your face is reflecting the light and love of Christ.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.240]   Look, I know, I know it can be hard to forgive yourself.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.840]   I get it.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:14.140]   Your new identity comes from realizing that Jesus forgives you.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.100]   He says, "Those who look to him are radiant, their faces shall never be ashamed."
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.220]   He calls you son.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.540]   He calls you daughter.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:29.340]   Jesus says, "You are forgiven."
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.860]   Do you agree with Him?
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:45.520]   As the band comes back, could we all stand?
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:52.660]   I believe we've got some business to do tonight.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.300]   Don't worry about what you're gonna have for dinner.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.580]   You can worry about the 15 minutes.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.900]   We're gonna pray, we're gonna pray for restoration.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:11.060]   We're gonna receive the freedom that he has for us.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.980]   If you're in the overflow room or even if you're watching at home, you might want to
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.300]   stand with us as well.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.540]   Because I'm gonna ask you to repeat a prayer after me.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:23.780]   Why I'm gonna ask you to do this is actually a confession of your lips.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.780]   It's the first thing there.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.180]   The first thing we're gonna do is repent.
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.700]   Then we're gonna renounce.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:41.380]   And thirdly, we're gonna break.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:50.060]   So repeat after me, "Father God, I repent of doubting your love for me.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:43:00.900]   I also repent of believing that you have really forgiven me and that the blood of Jesus has
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:14.460]   cleansed me from all of the sin, all of the guilt, and all of the shame of my past.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:24.780]   Heavenly God, I repent and listening and agreeing with the voice of the accuser, telling me
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:34.100]   that I'm an evil person, that I'm dirty, and that I'm unworthy to come and receive your
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.260]   love.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:46.740]   Here today, I renounce guilt, false guilt, and shame.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:56.940]   I renounce condemnation, self-condemnation, and all sense of unworthiness.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:10.780]   I renounce every spirit assigned to work against me with guilt, shame, and condemnation.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:21.540]   I renounce what they have done to keep me from becoming the person God created me to
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.540]   be."
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.420]   We're gonna break these now.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:38.940]   I break all agreements I have made with the lying voices of guilt, shame, and condemnation.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:46.500]   I break all word curses I have spoken about myself.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:57.980]   I break all soul ties and all generational ties that would bind me in any way to past
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:03.220]   guilt, shame, or condemnation.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:13.420]   I break every vow, covenant, or agreement, and all word curses that would give these
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:21.260]   spirits any power or influence in my life.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:33.740]   All spirits of guilt, shame, and condemnation, I break your power over me in the mighty name
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.620]   of Jesus.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:50.740]   Father God, I choose to open my heart to receive your unconditional love, your grace and forgiveness,
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:59.380]   and a full release from all guilt and shame in my life.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:13.260]   And by your grace, I also choose to forgive myself in Jesus' name.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.980]   I believe that God has done something in us tonight.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:26.260]   We've identified these major tools of the enemy in guilt, shame, and condemnation.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:32.780]   And we've broken their power in the name of Jesus.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:36.500]   I'm going to ask you to do one thing now.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.260]   I'm going to ask you to lift your head.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.860]   You don't need to stoop anymore.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:42.860]   Lift your head.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   Lift your head.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:49.620]   And I'm going to read these words again over you.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:47:00.740]   Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed.
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.140]   Let's declare this as we sing this song, "My Chains Are Gone."
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:09.940]   The price is paid.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.220]   Amazing grace.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.180]   Let's sing this together as a church.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:14.540]   Amen.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.540]   [Music]
