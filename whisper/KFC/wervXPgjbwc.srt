1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 Amen.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:18,560
 I have been told that I should use this, so I'm going to confess here, I am not like

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,600
 Pastor James where he just preaches without notes.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,280
 I need notes.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,880
 So I'm going to kind of use this so that we can stick with the rules instead of breaking

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
 it.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,720
 So we're going to try to share God's word.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
 I'm going to move around.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
 Is that okay?

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
 Is that okay?

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,240
 I was asking them, do I need to wear a mask or not?

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,240
 Because the whole situation, but praise God, we could actually go to places now and not

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
 necessarily wear a mask.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
 So I'm just really grateful.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,920
 How many of you miss John and Sandra, Pastor John and Sandra?

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
 Amen.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,120
 We miss him tremendously at our first pastors gathering, prayer gathering that we have every

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,800
 single month.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,480
 And it's really interesting because I don't know what it is, but pastors and free food

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
 always brings many of them out.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,960
 So we had a bunch of pastors, we were able to gather together and we just realized how

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,040
 big of a shoe it is to fill in when Pastor John and Sandra, they're not with us.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,440
 So I pray that all of us will be in prayer for them.

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,640
 As you know that they're in a very difficult situation.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,240
 So we're praying that they'll quickly come back to Hong Kong.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,240
 Hong Kong is always better when we have Pastor John and Sandra joining us.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,520
 So praise God for that.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
 Amen.

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,240
 So we're going to be praying together.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,760
 And one of the things that I do want to share is that I've been really encouraged.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,200
 I was just watching some of the different announcements and different things that you're

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,960
 doing and what a great encouragement and also an opportunity to actually minister to many

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,480
 people who have yet to hear the gospel through these different avenues of people with mental

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,480
 health and struggling through different grief and different situations.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,280
 So my encouragement to you is that take advantage of all the different opportunities that you

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,560
 just heard by Bonnie and just the different things that are happening in this church,

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,880
 especially the Easter retreat.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,920
 What a great way to bond together and experience God together.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
 I'm sharing this.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,160
 Pastor John didn't tell me to say this, but I'm just sharing this because it is a blessing

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,960
 for all of us to be a part of all that he's doing.

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,380
 So I'm going to go ahead and ask us to turn to Ephesians if you have your Bibles.

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,440
 If not, it's going to be up here, so don't feel uncomfortable.

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,320
 I'm going to talk about just simply together.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,520
 That's what I'm going to try to address.

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,160
 And I talked to Pastor John and he kind of gave me an overview and I watched his sermon,

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,180
 the first one that he actually gave through video.

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,360
 It was such a blessing because as you remember in that video, one of the things that he mentioned

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,000
 as I was listening, I was really excited for you as a church, the body of Christ, is that

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,960
 the vision was us, you, them.

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
 What a great concept.

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,480
 What God is doing in us and then you have then have a responsibility to do something

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,160
 about that and to be able to reach out to the city.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,760
 That's why it was encouraging to hear that you're going to focus in on equipping the

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,220
 saints so that you can serve the community.

56
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,580
 I'm joining you in prayer, in spirit, in asking God to use this church to be able to be a

57
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,260
 blessing to Hong Kong.

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,100
 And so as you're turning to Ephesians chapter 4, we're going to just look at six verses

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,300
 today.

60
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,780
 And I want to start off with a question and the question is this, did you ever come to

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,500
 the realization that you were the actual cause of disunity?

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,040
 I want you to think about that for a moment because a lot of times we're not self-aware

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,860
 that we're actually the cause of disunity.

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:54,220
 In fact, can I challenge us to kind of think about our relationship with our families?

65
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:01,220
 The thought that we are actually the cause of disunity within our families.

66
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,100
 Think about maybe at work with some of your colleagues that you can actually be the one,

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,060
 whether you're gossiping or maybe you just don't like that person, but you're the cause

68
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,340
 of disunity.

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,420
 It might be among some of your friends group, the people that you hang out with, that every

70
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,100
 single time you're there, there are other people who don't want to be there.

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,500
 Or when that other person is there, you don't want to be there and you realize that you

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,140
 cause, you are one of the causes possibly of disunity.

73
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,180
 And the reason why I want to start off this way is to actually tell you my story.

74
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,420
 I really didn't have a heart for unity.

75
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,460
 I didn't think that it was very important.

76
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,660
 I knew it in scripture, but I just didn't see it practically lived out.

77
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,900
 So I want to share a story back in 1996.

78
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,060
 My wife and I, we actually graduated from the university.

79
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,060
 I went to seminary.

80
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,260
 I served as a youth pastor for about four and a half years.

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,340
 And then my wife and I, we went to University of Michigan to start our church, Harvest Mission

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,800
 Community Church back in 1996.

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,740
 And we were young.

84
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,500
 You know that one song, "Young, dumb, and broke"?

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,460
 That was us.

86
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,920
 We were so young.

87
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,220
 We thought the whole future was ahead of us.

88
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,100
 We thought we knew what we were doing.

89
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,340
 Well, at least I did.

90
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,220
 And this feeling of, we're going to conquer the world.

91
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,780
 So we came to the University of Michigan and we started the church.

92
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,700
 And one of the things I wanted to do was just kind of meet with different people who are

93
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,340
 already on the campus doing ministry, church leaders, as well as pastors.

94
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,260
 And I was just kind of thinking about this.

95
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,380
 And when I look back at that time, man, I was thinking to myself, if I met someone like

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
 myself back then, I would have probably hated this guy.

97
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,100
 I'm like, "Who is this guy?"

98
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,180
 And one group that I kind of butted heads with were some of the parachurches at the

99
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,260
 University of Michigan.

100
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,260
 And so pretty much I was trying to explain to them, "We're not a parachurch.

101
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,620
 We're a local church.

102
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,100
 And we're going to reach out to students and we're going to do all this stuff and we're

103
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,140
 going to change the world."

104
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,460
 And I remember they kind of gave me this look like, "Who are you?"

105
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,460
 And I just didn't care.

106
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,900
 I didn't care what they thought.

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,220
 We're going to go and do this.

108
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,740
 And guess what happened?

109
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,020
 Pretty much all the parachurches would list all the names of churches that you could attend

110
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,780
 to and they purposely decided to not put our names out because they're like, "Who are

111
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
 these guys?

112
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,940
 We don't want someone like him to be a part of this community."

113
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,700
 So in many ways, I said, "You know what?

114
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
 We don't need you.

115
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,460
 We're going to do our thing."

116
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,340
 And so this went on for several years until a morning prayer.

117
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,260
 We had a time just every Monday through Friday we had this morning prayer at 6.30 in the

118
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,300
 morning.

119
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,620
 And so I was in my own prayer and I was praying for the city.

120
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:01,740
 I was praying for God to send a revival in the midst of Ann Arbor, Michigan.

121
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,100
 And as I was praying, I was like, "God, why aren't you sending a revival?

122
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,900
 Why are the hardness of hearts?"

123
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,340
 I was just sharing all this stuff to God.

124
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,940
 I was pouring out my heart.

125
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,420
 And all of a sudden, I heard or it felt like a voice, an audible voice, but it was more

126
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
 of impression.

127
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,780
 I just felt like...

128
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,720
 I'm like, "What is the cause, Lord?"

129
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,160
 And I felt like God was saying, "You are the cause of the lack of revival."

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,380
 Of course, the first thing is, "Get behind me, Satan."

131
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,160
 You know, that surely is not from God.

132
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,020
 But in that moment when I felt that that was impressed upon my heart, I was thinking about

133
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:46,740
 this and I said, "Lord, if it's me, I'm causing the sense of disunity in this city, then I

134
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,500
 repent."

135
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,160
 And I spent some time that morning just repenting and God started bringing me all these different

136
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,620
 thoughts and experiences and my interactions with people in that city.

137
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,040
 And I realized that it was out of my pride and I did not come humbly to be able to say,

138
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,340
 "God is already doing something and we need to partner together."

139
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,040
 And so it was in that moment where I was feeling this conviction of the Holy Spirit and then

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,680
 I felt something else.

141
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,340
 And this part, it was really Satan, "Get behind me."

142
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,420
 Because I felt God was telling me, "From your mission's budget, I want you to bless some

143
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,000
 of these ministries with no strings attached.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,780
 Give them cash, bless them.

145
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,940
 No strings attached, say, "Hey, we want you to build up your ministry so we can see the

146
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,120
 city reach with the gospel of Jesus Christ."

147
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,520
 Man, that was tough.

148
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,880
 I thought maybe I was halfway sleeping, I misheard, but I really felt that's what God

149
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
 was saying.

150
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,040
 So what I did was I went to our executive team and I told them what God was kind of

151
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,600
 placing on my heart and we had some funds from our missions fund that we wanted to use

152
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,740
 and we ended up giving some of that money to various ministries with no strings attached.

153
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,040
 And here's the exciting part.

154
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,600
 After that happened, I just felt like something broke.

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,160
 Whatever was bringing a sense of disunity, something broke.

156
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
 And after about four or five years, I'm just building some of those relationships that

157
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,160
 I completely cut off.

158
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,960
 After about four to five years, we had the largest student gathering in a big auditorium,

159
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,880
 about thousands of students to worship God all together in unity.

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,840
 And that was probably one of the most powerful moments where God spoke to me about the importance

161
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:52,520
 of unity, not only in the church, but in the one church in that city with many congregations.

162
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,680
 And it was in that moment God started to put that seed of not only that repentance that

163
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:06,880
 I needed of my pride, but also that seed of a vision that God can actually use not just

164
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:15,680
 that one church, your church, but he uses all the churches as we are united together.

165
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,760
 And that's when I just saw God doing some amazing things while we were serving there

166
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,720
 at the University of Michigan.

167
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,960
 I don't know what it is, but sometimes we don't realize the importance of unity and

168
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,560
 the power of unity until there is that moment of realization.

169
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,640
 I want to share a picture with you, some pictures.

170
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,000
 I don't know if some of you have seen this before.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
 This is American football.

172
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,840
 I know they call football here something different.

173
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,520
 They call it soccer in the United States.

174
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,200
 But as some of you are familiar with American football, you probably have heard this on

175
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 the news.

176
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,720
 It was January 2nd of this year, so the beginning of the year.

177
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,360
 The Buffalo Bills were playing against Cincinnati Bengals, and one of the players from the Buffalo

178
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,000
 Bills, he ended up having a cardiac arrest.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,720
 And DeMar Hamlin, he ended up collapsing on the field.

180
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,480
 And that's when just people started gathering together in prayer.

181
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,000
 In that moment of crisis, we saw people gathering together to pray.

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,100
 And here's the picture that someone took, and they were in prayer together.

183
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,120
 But the picture that I love the most is this next picture.

184
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
 They were at the hospital.

185
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,480
 You can tell Cincinnati Bengals fans, along with Buffalo Bills fans, because all things

186
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,680
 be equal, they hated each other.

187
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:48,320
 But here they are coming together because of a crisis, because of a situation.

188
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,920
 That's why there is something about difficulties that bring people together.

189
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,440
 I think about Hong Kong and everything that has transpired in the last five some years,

190
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,640
 or even longer.

191
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,560
 And as you know, there are many people moving on, they're going to other places, and Lord

192
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,960
 bless them, this is the calling that God has for them in their lives.

193
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,940
 But many of us are here in Hong Kong, and this is part of our calling.

194
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,600
 So what is it that God is trying to do?

195
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,540
 So in the midst of so much change, in the midst of everything that has been happening,

196
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,320
 what is it that God is trying to do?

197
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,760
 And I'm wondering if one of the things that He's trying to do is that He's trying to bring

198
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,200
 the churches together in the midst of the situation that we're experiencing.

199
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,320
 He's trying to bring the church of Jesus Christ together.

200
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 I love what D.L.

201
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
 Moody said.

202
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,040
 He said this, he says, "I have never yet known the Spirit of God to work where the Lord's

203
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,800
 people are divided."

204
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,940
 Isn't that true?

205
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,320
 When the people of God are divided, it's very difficult to see the Spirit of God move.

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,200
 That's not only true in your family, especially if the dad and the mom, they're not united.

207
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
 You can feel the tension.

208
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,260
 You've been there.

209
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,960
 Some of you are parents.

210
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,440
 Some of you are children of parents, and you've seen the disunity and how it breaks down the

211
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
 family.

212
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,660
 There's tension, there's anxiety.

213
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,680
 You'll see it not only that, but as I mentioned before, in the workplace.

214
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,280
 You'll see that in the church, and you'll definitely see it in a city where it's so

215
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,400
 easy to compare churches against other churches.

216
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,840
 It's so easy to say, "Wait a minute.

217
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
 What happened to all these people?

218
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,680
 Oh, they left and they went to another church."

219
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,360
 And we're like, "We hate that church.

220
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,160
 They're taking our members."

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,880
 Or those of you who came from another church, we love you.

222
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 Welcome.

223
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
 Welcome.

224
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,720
 But once again, it is so easy to lose sight of what it is that God has to him because

225
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,760
 of the division and because of this disunity.

226
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:05,080
 So Kung Fu Church International 2023, as you really focus on just being equipped as the

227
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,700
 saints of God, I pray that you will serve the community so well.

228
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,680
 And as we link up together with all the churches in Hong Kong, that's one thing I really miss

229
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,000
 about Pastor John.

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,320
 He's always talking about the one church in Hong Kong with many congregations.

231
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,040
 I love that because that's been my heartbeat and that's what God has been reminding me

232
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
 time and time again.

233
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
 There's only one church.

234
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
 Come on, everyone said that.

235
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,520
 There's one church with many congregations.

236
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,780
 That's Hong Kong, one church with many different congregations.

237
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,180
 And so the one thing that I want us to remember as I get into this text is that we live out

238
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:51,260
 our calling with clarity as we fulfill our calling to unity.

239
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:58,100
 That we live out our calling with clarity as we fulfill our calling to unity.

240
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,860
 I'm going to highlight two things in these six verses that talks about living out our

241
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,400
 calling with clarity as we fulfill our calling to unity.

242
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,600
 The first thing is this, that we must have ownership of our calling.

243
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,680
 That we must have ownership of our calling.

244
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,380
 It's important to put this passage in context.

245
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,100
 In chapter one, chapter two, and chapter three of the book of Ephesians, Apostle Paul is

246
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,100
 presenting more of his theological values.

247
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,540
 Some of you have read the book of Ephesians, you realize a lot of it is talking about who

248
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:40,580
 we are in Christ, what he has done, and how he has brought people, the Gentiles and the

249
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,320
 Jews together.

250
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,500
 And everything he mentions in the first three chapters are all theological foundations that

251
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,340
 he's building up until we come to chapter four.

252
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,640
 Now he's talking about in light of chapter one, two, and three, what do we do now with

253
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,860
 all this information?

254
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,380
 And that's where we dive in to chapter four.

255
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,820
 And all the way to chapter six, so chapter four, chapter five, chapter six, it's simply

256
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,940
 practical things lived out in light of what he talked about in chapter one through three.

257
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,820
 And so that's why we want to talk about this ownership of our calling.

258
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,300
 There are two things that we notice when it comes to this ownership of our calling.

259
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,940
 The first is you've got to remember the gospel.

260
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,340
 If you are going to have ownership of the calling that God has given to you, then you

261
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,700
 have to remember the gospel.

262
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
 Let's go ahead and read verse one, it should be up here.

263
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,820
 The verse one, it says this, "I therefore a prisoner for the Lord urge you to walk in

264
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,340
 a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called."

265
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,320
 So here's Apostle Paul, right away we notice two words up there.

266
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,780
 In verse one, that's very important, I want to highlight those two words for us.

267
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,260
 The first word is therefore.

268
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,860
 What it's doing is that it's connecting that everything that Paul established, once again,

269
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,660
 in chapters one through three, now he's putting it into practice in our daily lives.

270
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:13,600
 So he says, "This, this, and this, therefore," now he's bringing it home to speak to us.

271
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,620
 What he's emphasizing is what you believe determines how you will live.

272
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,220
 I want you to think about that for a moment.

273
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,700
 What you believe will determine how you live.

274
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,440
 So if you believe success will make you happy, guess what you're going to do?

275
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,120
 How you live your life.

276
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,100
 If you think to yourself, and what you believe is that, "Oh, if I have a relationship, then

277
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,540
 that's going to make everything, all my problems go away," then that's what you're going to

278
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,080
 act upon.

279
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,420
 What you believe is so important and determines what you do.

280
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,700
 That's why Paul is clearly establishing that everything that I have said to you in the

281
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:01,040
 last three chapters, it is the foundation now of how I'm going to share with you how

282
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,260
 you ought to live your life.

283
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,740
 That's why the second word that's very important is the word urge.

284
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,100
 It can be translated as implore or to appeal.

285
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,920
 So I implore you, I appeal to you.

286
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,560
 If you want to look at a different translation, I beg you.

287
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,380
 So he's saying, because of everything that Christ has done, therefore, I am begging you,

288
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,580
 I am imploring you, I am appealing to you.

289
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,040
 And what is he appealing?

290
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,840
 What is he imploring us to do?

291
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,380
 Now before I mention it, this is what I want to speak to us because we live in Asia.

292
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,620
 I know not everyone is Asian by birth, but you live in Asia, so let me just say this.

293
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,820
 When you are from Asia, and this is some of you, this is all you know, the gospel that

294
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,440
 many of you know is based on works.

295
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
 How do I know this?

296
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,580
 Think about it this way.

297
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,740
 When bad things start happening to you, then what is the first thing that you do?

298
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,740
 Oh, I got to do something.

299
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,060
 Oh, I should read my Bible.

300
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,300
 I don't read my Bible.

301
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,480
 I should pray.

302
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,380
 Or let's put it this way.

303
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,460
 It's going to be that first blind date with that somebody.

304
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,940
 And then you're like, oh Lord, let it be.

305
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,220
 Let it be.

306
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
 So what do you do?

307
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,260
 I got to read the Bible so that God will bless me.

308
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:27,700
 See, that's a works mindset, which says that if I do something, that God will do this.

309
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,980
 And that is a totally anti-gospel.

310
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,540
 The gospel simply says God has already, he has already done something for us.

311
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
 Amen?

312
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,220
 He has done something in our lives.

313
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:46,780
 So now what we are doing, it is out of a motivation because of the gospel.

314
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:54,020
 That's a gospel-oriented mindset that simply says we do things because God first loved

315
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,260
 us.

316
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,500
 And that's what the urging is based on.

317
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,260
 Therefore, I urge you because of what Christ has done.

318
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,340
 This is very similar to Romans chapter 12, verse 1.

319
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
 And I want you to read the yellow sections with me.

320
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
 Will you do that?

321
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,180
 It says this, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers," what?

322
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,340
 "In view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to

323
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
 God."

324
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,140
 This is your spiritual act of worship.

325
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,340
 So what he says is this, in view of God's mercy, you've already received mercy.

326
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,260
 Therefore, he's urging us to do what?

327
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,420
 To offer yourself.

328
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,060
 That's a gospel-oriented way to live your life.

329
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,740
 We do things because God has already done something for us.

330
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,060
 And we're motivated because of who Jesus Christ is and what he has done.

331
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,200
 Paul exhorts the believers to walk in a manner worthy of the calling.

332
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,400
 That word "to walk," you'll see this quite often in Paul's letters.

333
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,220
 It is in reference to this concept of "to live."

334
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,580
 So when you're walking, you're living.

335
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,260
 That's what Paul is simply saying.

336
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,400
 To walk means to live.

337
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,940
 And that's why he is reminding us to walk or to live in a way that is, what?

338
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,860
 In a manner worthy of the gospel.

339
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,940
 Some of us might not understand this, but the word "worthy," in this context, it means

340
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,700
 equal weight.

341
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,340
 So I want you to think about that for a moment.

342
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,620
 Paul says to walk or to live in equal weight.

343
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,940
 What is he trying to say?

344
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,740
 Well, this idea of calling comes from our, what Christ has done, which allows us to be

345
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,100
 a child of God, and then through salvation, which was purchased by Christ, nothing we

346
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,940
 have done, we can't earn it.

347
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:50,420
 So because he has purchased this salvation for us, this importance of the unity in the

348
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,020
 body that we're part of this family, that is what he's emphasizing.

349
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,100
 Now Apostle Paul is telling the believers to live in such a way of that one's calling,

350
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,340
 your calling.

351
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,900
 It should be equal weight or in balance.

352
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,480
 What does that mean?

353
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,980
 That means that you and I, we both have individual responsibility as well as in the context of

354
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,460
 the church and the world.

355
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
 Let me put it this way.

356
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,500
 Maybe this will help us understand.

357
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 Please do not raise your hand.

358
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580
 It's called a rhetorical question.

359
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
 I want you to think about it.

360
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,780
 How many of you have met a hypocrite in your life, in the church or a person who calls

361
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,780
 a Christian?

362
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
 You're like, "I haven't met him."

363
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,140
 It might be you, all right?

364
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:42,220
 So I would say all of us know of people who are like hypocrites, and they are saying one

365
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,460
 thing, but they're not living it out.

366
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,220
 So they're not in balance.

367
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,380
 They're not walking or living according to what is being said, and that's the part that

368
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,760
 turns people off.

369
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,500
 So here's Paul, and he says to live a life that is worthy of the calling, that's equal

370
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:05,380
 weight so that what Christ has done for us will be reflected in how you live your life.

371
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:11,380
 Now this is a powerful thought because as you remember this gospel, guess what happens?

372
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,620
 What will help you have ownership of this calling is now you got to respond to the gospel.

373
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,780
 That's the second thing.

374
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,900
 You got to respond to that.

375
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,740
 Not only do you remember the gospel, but now you respond to the gospel.

376
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,420
 Let's read verse two and three.

377
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,020
 This is what the Word of God says.

378
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,180
 "With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to

379
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,140
 maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace."

380
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:41,620
 It is clear that as we remember the gospel, this will enable us to be more responsible

381
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,720
 in living for Christ.

382
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,480
 We have to know how this ought to be lived out.

383
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,020
 That's why in verse two and three, Paul gives some of these characteristic traits of how

384
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,420
 we to live our lives in response to the gospel.

385
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,580
 The words and phrases such as humility, gentleness, patience, bearing with one another in love,

386
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:08,900
 and maintaining all unity, all these things point to this one concept of reconciliation.

387
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,300
 You cannot have reconciliation when there's no humility.

388
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,660
 Think about some of your relationship with people that you don't get along with.

389
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,740
 There's either you or that person, there's no level of humility, that's why it's hard

390
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,180
 to reconcile.

391
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,120
 You can only have reconciliation when there's humility.

392
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,700
 Think about patience.

393
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,480
 You cannot have reconciliation when there's no patience, which is forbearing.

394
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,820
 You are willing to go through it and endure some of the people's messiness.

395
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,220
 It's difficult.

396
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,260
 Let's be honest here.

397
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,740
 When there are those people who are very toxic or maybe very draining on you, they're like

398
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,780
 the extra grace required people, you're like, "Oh my God."

399
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,500
 And you see them like, "Okay, I got to go to the bathroom."

400
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,140
 Those types of people.

401
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,580
 And it's difficult and it's hard.

402
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,700
 But when you are patient because you think about, "Man, God has been patient with me.

403
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,380
 Man, I screwed up, I messed up, I hurt somebody, but that person forgave me."

404
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,260
 And you think about the gospel, you remember the gospel, then your natural response is,

405
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,540
 "I need to respond to it in the same way."

406
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,300
 Just think about the opposites of these things, pride, harshness, impatience, frustration.

407
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,780
 They don't promote unity or reconciliation.

408
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,820
 This is what happens when we have ownership of our calling as well as unity within the

409
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,260
 body of Christ.

410
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:37,860
 That's why in verse three, as we read, the word "maintain" is translated as "to keep,

411
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,020
 to stay within, or to guard."

412
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,220
 So listen to me.

413
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
 This is really important.

414
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,660
 We got to get this in order to understand unity and what Paul is saying.

415
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:57,340
 When Paul says, "Maintain the unity," what he is trying to clearly state is that we already

416
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,860
 have it because of Jesus.

417
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,340
 The reason why we are united is because of Jesus Christ.

418
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,220
 That's why we have to watch over it.

419
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,760
 That's why we have to continue to maintain it.

420
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,180
 That's why we have to sustain it.

421
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,660
 It's not like we're not unified and we need unity.

422
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,140
 No, we have unity.

423
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
 Why?

424
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:24,100
 Because Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, and therefore he has made two into

425
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,500
 one, Gentiles and Jews.

426
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,580
 And he's saying, "Jesus provided and you have this unity because of Jesus, so now you and

427
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,860
 I, we are responsible, and the ownership of this is to maintain it."

428
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,140
 We have to keep the unity.

429
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,560
 We're not trying to discover it.

430
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,100
 We're not trying to form it.

431
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,560
 We're not trying to create it.

432
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,500
 We already have it, but we have to now maintain it.

433
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,980
 I love what Johnny Erickson Tata in her book, A Step Further, writes.

434
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,240
 She writes this, "Believers are never told to become one.

435
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,780
 We already are one and are expected to act like it."

436
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,820
 We're one because of Jesus.

437
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,600
 If you know Jesus, and as I know Jesus, we are one.

438
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,920
 If you have confessed your sins as Jesus Christ, as your Lord and Savior, and someone else

439
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,700
 has done the same, you are one.

440
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,500
 One of the things that I love is when I travel around to different places.

441
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,820
 I mean, there are times when I'm in different countries where they're singing a song in

442
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,180
 a different language, and I don't even know what they're saying.

443
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,840
 Well, hallelujah, I know because it's universal.

444
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,100
 So that's when I sing really loud, you know, because like, "Hallelujah."

445
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,260
 You know, we sing really loud.

446
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,660
 That part of it, it's a universal thing.

447
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,480
 You've been there, you know.

448
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,140
 But it's amazing because even though I don't know them, even though we just met maybe an

449
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,180
 hour ago, there's a kindred spirit.

450
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
 Why?

451
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,160
 Because of Jesus Christ.

452
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,680
 So we're already one.

453
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,520
 Now we have to maintain it, sustain it.

454
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,800
 So when I think about all the churches in Hong Kong, we have unity because of whom?

455
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,440
 Jesus Christ.

456
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,080
 So that's why we have to keep on working at maintaining it.

457
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,120
 That's why the pastors gather together once a month to pray, to fellowship.

458
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
 Why?

459
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,400
 Because we need it.

460
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,840
 That's why I want to know what's going on in your church.

461
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,840
 Even though your church might be bigger than mine, your church is better in this area than

462
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,720
 our church, but we love you.

463
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,480
 You're a very important part to this community, to Hong Kong, to reach every single person,

464
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,560
 7.4 million people.

465
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,680
 We need you.

466
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,360
 We need you to survive.

467
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,560
 Even in the midst of COVID, when so many churches are closing down, we need you to be a part

468
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,400
 of this community because of what Jesus Christ has done.

469
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:57,000
 That's that responsibility to say, "We are one and we need to maintain it."

470
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,300
 That's why in Galatians chapter 5, verse 16, 22 to 23, and also 25, that idea of this walking

471
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,300
 and being in step, the only way we're going to get it is through the Spirit of God.

472
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,120
 That is the thing that maintains the unity is the Spirit of God.

473
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
 Paul says what?

474
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,160
 And I want you to read the yellow sections with me.

475
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,480
 Can you just say it with me?

476
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,800
 It says this, "But I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the

477
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,720
 flesh, but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

478
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,680
 faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

479
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,200
 Against such things there is no law.

480
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,540
 If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit."

481
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,000
 So walking and living in the Spirit of God.

482
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,480
 How about us this late afternoon, early evening?

483
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,060
 Do you remember the gospel and what God has done in your life?

484
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:57,840
 How do you respond on a daily basis because of the gospel?

485
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,800
 Do you have ownership of your calling that Christ has purchased for us on the cross?

486
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,420
 Not only as a follower of Jesus Christ, but somebody who you're supposed to maintain this

487
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,720
 unity of the Spirit.

488
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,360
 If you don't have ownership of it, then we're not going to be able to maintain this unity.

489
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,640
 And I want to speak to all of you right here because this is your church.

490
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
 This is your church family.

491
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,920
 But it's just a microcosm of the bigger church family here in Hong Kong.

492
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,200
 If you cannot maintain the unity in this group, even though the age is different, even though

493
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,280
 ethnicity might be different, language sometimes, if you're more comfortable with one language

494
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,440
 over another, if there is no unity here, we cannot unify with or maintain the unity with

495
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,600
 other churches here in Hong Kong.

496
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,640
 That's why we've got to pray in the Spirit and ask Him to help us.

497
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,600
 Let me close with the second point.

498
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 We must not only have ownership of our calling, but we see here that we must have oneness

499
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,720
 within our calling.

500
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
 Oneness within our calling.

501
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,880
 I really hate to do this, but I'm going to show you this picture.

502
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,800
 Can we look at this picture?

503
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,400
 I really hate to do this because I'm a Chelsea fan.

504
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:20,060
 But because I love Pastor John so much, I decided to show this picture.

505
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:25,480
 And when I saw this picture, I said to myself, "This is great."

506
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,120
 Not only because we have a Korean, because I'm Korean-American, so praise the Lord.

507
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,620
 Yeah.

508
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,160
 But something about the Spurs, as you look at them, and many other sports teams often,

509
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,880
 is that there's a sense of diversity and different races, but they're united together because

510
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,080
 there's a common goal to win a championship.

511
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,880
 The Premier League, EPL.

512
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,480
 And so when I look at this picture, I realize we have people from Caucasian or white descent,

513
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,120
 we have a Korean there, we have someone from an African descent or background, but they're

514
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,600
 together because of that common goal.

515
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,600
 And then I was thinking, well, sports actually brings not only the players, but if you look

516
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,240
 at the next picture, just even the fans.

517
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,060
 I mean, you have people from maybe the Arab background, you have people from the white

518
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,560
 descent, and you have some people from Africa.

519
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
 I mean, where are the Koreans?

520
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
 I don't know.

521
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:40,480
 But anyway, you just see that diversity even in the sports.

522
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,480
 And I want to share this because this is what Apostle Paul is saying as we close out in

523
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,440
 these next couple of verses, is this idea of this oneness.

524
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,020
 What he is emphasizing is we have this within our calling.

525
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,640
 So once you have this ownership, and then you begin to understand this oneness that

526
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:08,480
 has to come, that's part of a calling, then maintaining unity can be done.

527
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
 So let's read verse four through six.

528
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,520
 This is what the Word of God says.

529
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,040
 "There is one body and one spirit, just as you were called to the one whole that belongs

530
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:23,960
 to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all

531
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,320
 and through all and in all."

532
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,840
 What a way to close out this section in verse six, and also verse four and five.

533
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,080
 So what is the significance of this?

534
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,920
 Paul mentions seven, seven key foundational components that establish and provide the

535
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,880
 spirit of unity as followers of Jesus Christ.

536
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,080
 I want you to notice the word "one."

537
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,660
 Everyone say "one."

538
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:58,020
 You will notice that word repeated over and over again to describe each of these components.

539
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:04,600
 It shows the centrality of the call to unity.

540
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,400
 So one body, this is the universal church.

541
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,680
 It's not just one church like here, but it's one body.

542
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,120
 It's the universal church around the whole world.

543
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:23,440
 And how many of you heard from Pastor John all the time, like, "There's only one church

544
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,020
 in Hong Kong."

545
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,320
 And I believe that, and I resonate with that, because there's not all these churches, but

546
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,880
 there's only one church.

547
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,760
 The second thing is one spirit.

548
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,620
 It's in reference to the Holy Spirit that dwells in us.

549
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,560
 It doesn't dwell in those who do not know Jesus Christ, but it dwells in us as believers

550
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,200
 and in the church.

551
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,160
 That's why there's one spirit.

552
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,400
 It talks about one hope.

553
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,760
 What is it referencing to?

554
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,760
 It's referencing to all the believers that the way we regard our future is in Christ

555
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,840
 and is with God.

556
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,220
 So it's this idea of there's a hope that we have that is so different from anyone else

557
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,920
 in this world, and it's one hope because it is found in Jesus.

558
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,120
 The fourth thing is one Lord.

559
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,360
 It's a reference to Christ, who is the shepherd of the whole church.

560
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,120
 So it's that one Lord.

561
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,080
 The one faith is in reference to both.

562
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,560
 If you look at some of the commentaries, they will say it's both the subjective faith as

563
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,720
 well as the objective faith, that it is our faith in Christ, but also this faith that

564
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 we have as we live our lives.

565
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,840
 One faith.

566
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,240
 One baptism.

567
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,000
 This can be referenced to water baptism or the believers' identification to Christ's

568
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,040
 death and his resurrection, but it is one baptism that we all believe in, that we have

569
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,320
 died to ourselves, and now we resurrect from the dead.

570
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,000
 And then lastly, one God.

571
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,680
 This is a reference to God being the Father because of the relationship with Him and through

572
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,040
 Jesus Christ.

573
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,280
 That's why not only are we related in that way, not by blood, but we're connected because

574
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,440
 we have one Father.

575
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,760
 Now, we conclude that through these important foundational elements, we are united together

576
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,160
 because God the Father, as we put our faith in Jesus Christ and our identification with

577
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,280
 this baptism.

578
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
 I want you to notice verse 6.

579
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,040
 I don't know if you have seen this.

580
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,760
 We notice in that last verse, I love verse 6, we notice the word "all."

581
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,680
 Everyone say "all."

582
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,720
 It is repeated four times.

583
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,880
 From this passage, verse 6, can we go back to verse 6?

584
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,040
 I just want to read this again.

585
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,040
 Okay, we're going to have to go through all this.

586
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
 Sorry.

587
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:47,960
 It says, "One God and Father," and it says, "of all, who is over all, and through all,

588
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,040
 and in all."

589
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,080
 So from this usage of this last verse, we notice several things.

590
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,600
 I'm going to close with this.

591
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,660
 God is Father to all His followers.

592
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,840
 That means that we see God is this Father of those who put their trust in Him.

593
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
 We are His children.

594
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,460
 That's why it says, "Father of all."

595
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:16,880
 God is sovereign over all because God is supreme and in control of all things.

596
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,080
 God works through all His followers because that's why it says it's through Him and all

597
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,880
 is through Him is because He's operating in the life of the believer and He's using His

598
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,160
 spirit.

599
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,040
 And lastly, God dwells in all His followers.

600
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,520
 God's presence lives within us.

601
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,720
 Paul used similar language when he described the preeminence of Christ to the people of

602
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
 Colossae.

603
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,140
 In Colossae chapter 1, verse 16, I want you to read the yellow section with me.

604
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
 Listen to what it says.

605
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:52,060
 "For by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether

606
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:59,840
 thrones or dominions or rulers or all authority, all things were created through Him and for

607
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
 Him."

608
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,360
 It's the preeminence of Christ.

609
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,320
 And the beautiful thing about us, because of Jesus Christ, we can maintain this unity

610
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,940
 and become one.

611
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,560
 It doesn't mean we all look alike, we all do the same thing, but there is unity in the

612
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,920
 midst of diversity.

613
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,060
 There is this oneness because of Christ.

614
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,760
 How about us this evening?

615
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,080
 Do you know that we have oneness because of what Christ has done for us?

616
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,400
 Are there people in your life who are believers that you're not living in unity with?

617
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,300
 Maybe someone has hurt you, maybe some people have left or you've come from another church

618
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,560
 because you've been hurt.

619
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,300
 Is there this lack of unity with other believers?

620
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,560
 Are there people that you see in other churches, instead of lifting them up, it's easy to criticize

621
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,280
 them, "Oh, they don't have this kind of doctrine," or "They don't do this," rather than saying,

622
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,720
 "God, He is our Father and we are united.

623
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,640
 Let's maintain the spirit of unity."

624
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,120
 That's why this is simply the gospel.

625
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:12,240
 The gospel says that God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, they were in one,

626
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,200
 they were together.

627
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,560
 He created Adam and Eve.

628
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,320
 And in that oneness that they had, sin entered in.

629
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,800
 And it brought enmity with God and themselves and even amongst one another.

630
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,960
 That's where shame was introduced, as they had to cover themselves because they realized

631
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
 that they were naked.

632
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,960
 And if you look all throughout history and throughout the Bible, you realize that they

633
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
 were sinning against this Holy God.

634
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:48,040
 But this is the beautiful story of the gospel, that Jesus Christ, the Son, was sent into

635
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
 this world.

636
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,840
 God is amazing because God the Father, He longed for us, so He sent prophets.

637
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,840
 He sends kings and different people so that the Israelite people will know that they have

638
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,660
 a calling to be a blessing to the nations, so that all the nations can be blessed.

639
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,360
 But they failed in their mission, and guess what happened?

640
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,640
 That's why Jesus had to come.

641
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,160
 And He lived a perfect life that you and I could not live.

642
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:21,040
 And when He lived this perfect life, He became a perfect sacrifice, and He died on the cross.

643
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,240
 That should have been our cross, that should have been our death, because we should be

644
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,200
 punished for our sins.

645
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,440
 But Jesus took our place.

646
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,960
 This is the reason why when He died and rose again from the dead, the very thing that Satan

647
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,440
 had as his last weapon, which was death, Jesus Christ conquered that.

648
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,560
 So that means now, when you put your faith and trust in Jesus Christ, you will be part

649
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:54,640
 of this incredible spiritual family, that you will be one with not only God, because

650
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,240
 the walls of enmity has been broken down, but you will be one with other brothers and

651
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,280
 sisters in Christ.

652
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,800
 If you place your faith in Jesus.

653
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,760
 And I pray that one of these days, if some of you are still seeking, that you will make

654
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,320
 that commitment.

655
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,820
 If you are a believer, I pray that you will maintain this unity, so that people will know

656
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,160
 that we are His disciples, if we love one another.

657
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,280
 So once again, the one thing is, we live out our calling with clarity, as we fulfill our

658
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,920
 calling to unity.

659
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,000
 Before we leave here, one of the things that I try to do in our church is, let's not just

660
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,120
 sit there and say, "Oh, that was okay, that's good information," because information will

661
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,600
 not change us.

662
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,160
 It is the Spirit of God, as we apply these things and obey, where we will experience

663
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,540
 transformation.

664
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,440
 So can I just give some practical next steps?

665
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,200
 You just pray through, let the Holy Spirit speak to you.

666
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,740
 You could do one, you could do two, or however the Lord speaks to you.

667
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:04,040
 In light of this message, as we talked about how we live out our calling with clarity,

668
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,600
 as we fulfill our calling to unity, I'm just going to use the word "one," O-N-E.

669
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,920
 The first thing is this, own your part in unity with humility and prayer.

670
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
 Own it.

671
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,360
 That means pray for this church, pray for one another.

672
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,560
 Be humble, that that person, you're not better than them, you're not more righteous than

673
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,480
 them.

674
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,260
 But you've got to love them because Christ first loved you.

675
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,620
 So own that.

676
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,500
 You own the unity when you are humble and you pray.

677
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,540
 My hope is this church will be a praying church.

678
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,340
 Let's pray and bring our hearts together, especially the retreat and so many other things

679
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:49,700
 that God is providing for you, that you will pray and have this, maintain this unity.

680
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,660
 The second thing, not only to own our part in unity with humility and prayer, but the

681
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,500
 second thing is network together to serve God.

682
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,660
 There are so many opportunities in this church that God is providing for you through the

683
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,020
 pastors and the staff where you can get involved.

684
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,580
 And as you work together, you'll see great things.

685
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,120
 I'm excited for what God's going to do this year for every single one of you.

686
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:21,780
 Because as you are being equipped by those that God has called to equip you, you will

687
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,340
 be able to then go and serve the community.

688
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,380
 I'm just so excited as we think about the One Campaign, as we think about so many other

689
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,860
 things.

690
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,280
 One of the things we're praying about is how do we serve the city?

691
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,980
 And so one of the things we're going to try to do is we're going to just find a day and

692
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,260
 you know, it's so easy to say, well, you guys already broke that.

693
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,020
 I was going to say, Sunday's the day we worship.

694
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,300
 No, Saturday too.

695
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,500
 And so here we are on Sunday, we come and we worship, we sing and do all this stuff.

696
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,920
 But I said, what if our worship this Sunday, one Sunday, is just to serve the community?

697
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,100
 So go to some places and pick up garbage.

698
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,820
 Go to some of these places where there are people who are marginalized.

699
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,740
 Serving them is our worship to God.

700
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,740
 What would it be like?

701
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,740
 This is just my dream.

702
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:12,020
 What would it be like if all the churches, all the congregation in Hong Kong, united

703
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,940
 together as one church, and we declare the greatness of God, because God first loved

704
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,020
 us and that's why God loves you and we love you and we want to serve you.

705
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,500
 Wow, that would be powerful.

706
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,620
 If all the churches can come together as one church and we serve this great city.

707
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,900
 That's my dream.

708
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,380
 If it ever happens, then I probably, I'm about to die.

709
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,380
 Okay.

710
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,680
 So I'm ready to go.

711
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,380
 If that could happen, that would be awesome.

712
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,140
 We serve the city all together with all the churches and we bless the community.

713
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
 I'm praying for that.

714
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,940
 Network together to serve God.

715
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,900
 Let's exalt Jesus's name together.

716
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,900
 Let's exalt it.

717
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,900
 It's all about him.

718
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,460
 Let's not make it about us, not make it about one church, but let's make it all about Jesus.

719
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,740
 Exalt his name together.

720
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,900
 I want to close with this minute and a half video, a really short video.

721
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,020
 I don't know how many of you know Jacob Collier.

722
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:10,180
 He's a musician, an artist, and one of his concerts in Sydney, he invited Natalie Imbruglia.

723
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,920
 I don't know if you know her, but she sang this famous song, "Torn."

724
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,100
 It's oldie, so some of you are like, "Oh, I don't know."

725
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,100
 Some of you guys were too oldie.

726
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,420
 You don't listen to any songs out there.

727
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,860
 Anyway, but she sang the song "Torn."

728
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,260
 And so I want to just kind of prep you before you watch this video.

729
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:36,700
 The reason why this moment in history was so important and pretty significant was that

730
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:41,180
 the audience became a spontaneous choir.

731
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,300
 So there's probably some people who are very talented musically in the audience, and there

732
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,580
 were some who are not very good.

733
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,580
 Every time they open their mouth, we're like, "Where is that coming from?"

734
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,220
 There's those kind of situation, but praise God.

735
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,940
 God is tone deaf, so he doesn't...

736
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,820
 Just sing from your heart, sing from your heart, like you're in the shower, so praise

737
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,820
 the Lord.

738
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:10,260
 But this concert, the audience became the choir, and then Jacob was the conductor leading

739
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,100
 the choir, and Natalie was just singing her song.

740
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,380
 And this is what I want you to notice as we close out with this video.

741
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,020
 The first thing I want you to notice, it was spontaneous.

742
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,820
 They were guided, but it was done out of just a spontaneity as they were singing.

743
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,900
 Second thing I want you to notice is everyone was involved and did their part.

744
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,280
 Every person had a part in the song as they were singing different parts.

745
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,340
 The third thing is everyone's eyes were fixed on Jacob, who was the conductor.

746
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,060
 Just watch, when you watch this video, look at people's eyes.

747
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,820
 They're all fixed.

748
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,840
 Their eyes are fixed on the conductor.

749
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:58,220
 The fourth thing is that the audience, they were directed and led by the conductor.

750
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,840
 Not only were they fixing their eyes, but they were listening to what this conductor

751
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,860
 was doing.

752
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:12,180
 And lastly, watch the end when they celebrated, after they sang this song, this incredible

753
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,580
 and beautiful music that they made.

754
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,580
 So let's watch this together.

755
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:31,580
 [music]

756
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:51,580
 [music]

757
00:47:51,580 --> 00:48:11,580
 [music]

758
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:31,580
 [music]

759
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:51,580
 [music]

760
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,580
 Can I just ask us to stand?

761
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,580
 Can we stand together?

762
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,580
 You've been sitting there for a little bit there.

763
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:02,580
 Wasn't that awesome?

764
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,580
 Amen.

765
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,580
 Who was the conductor for us?

766
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,580
 That's the Holy Spirit.

767
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:16,580
 And as we fix our eyes on Jesus, and we all have a part to play, we're going to make some

768
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:22,580
 awesome music, a music that the world will hear and be drawn to.

769
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:29,580
 They will know who Jesus is and that we are his disciples when we love one another in

770
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,580
 unity.

771
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:37,580
 May there never be Harvest Mission Community Church or Kung Fu Church International, even

772
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,580
 though names are important because you've got to call your children something, right?

773
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,580
 Hey, you.

774
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:49,580
 But I pray that it will be the Church of Jesus because it's all about him.

775
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,580
 And I'm telling you right now, if the world can actually see it, all of us unified because

776
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,580
 we are one because of Jesus, they will be like, "How in the world?

777
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,580
 You guys are all so different, but you guys are one."

778
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,580
 That's when they're going to understand how much Jesus loves them.

779
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:15,580
 I pray that we will not only pray for it, but we will fight for it to maintain the unity.

780
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:25,580
 And I'm looking forward in the future to networking together to win this city for Jesus Christ.

781
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,580
 Can I just pray for us?

782
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,580
 And then I'm going to hand it over, and I think the worship team will come and we'll

783
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,580
 sing a song, and then, sorry, we went a little bit long.

784
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,580
 We'll just dismiss you afterwards.

785
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,580
 So let me just pray for us.

786
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,580
 I'm going to ask us to do this.

787
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,580
 And if you feel uncomfortable, please, you don't have to do it.

788
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:47,580
 But if you're open to it, will you just grab onto someone's hand next to you as a sign of unity?

789
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,580
 If some of you are still afraid of the virus, you could lock elbows.

790
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,580
 You could lock elbows together.

791
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,580
 Come on, let's join the middle together.

792
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,580
 Can we just do that?

793
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,580
 Let's just come together in one, unified.

794
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,580
 Yeah, let's join together.

795
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,580
 Brothers and sisters, join the middle.

796
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:10,580
 Come on, slide over and just unite here.

797
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,580
 Just holding hands doesn't unite us, you know that.

798
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:20,580
 But it's just a symbol of our hearts that we're united with this brother or this sister standing next to me.

799
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:27,580
 And I stand with you as a pastor from another church, but yet we're serving Jesus together.

800
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:39,580
 And whether you speak Cantonese or all the Chinese churches or all the international churches that speak English and all the other languages that are spoken on a given Sunday as they have their service,

801
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:52,580
 we are one church, one body, one faith, one Lord, one hope, one Father, one God, Father of all, through all, so that He will be exalted and glorified.

802
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:59,580
 Heavenly Father, thank you so much for the unity that we have in Jesus Christ.

803
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,580
 And Lord, it's not something we create.

804
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,580
 You've already given it to us.

805
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,580
 And God, you're calling us to maintain it.

806
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:11,580
 Maintain it through diligence and prayer to be united together.

807
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:23,580
 So, God, I do pray that there will be the sense of clarity in our calling of who we are so that we could be together, united in this unity.

808
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,580
 And Lord, I pray that there will be an ownership, that each one of us will do our part.

809
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:38,580
 We won't just hand it off to somebody else, but we will have the ownership to be united together through humility and prayer.

810
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:45,580
 We also pray that we'll understand more of this oneness that comes because of what you have done, Jesus.

811
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:50,580
 And Lord, we're praying for unity, that we will maintain it here in Hong Kong.

812
00:52:50,580 --> 00:53:00,580
 In the midst of all the division, in the midst of all the bickering and divisions in the congregation and even within the bigger body of Christ.

813
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,580
 Bring our hearts together for such a time as this.

814
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,580
 This Kairos moment.

815
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,580
 Lord, we want to see this city transform for your glory.

816
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,580
