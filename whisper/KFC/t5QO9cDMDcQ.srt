00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Welcome to this special edition of KFCI Online. I cannot tell you how excited I am about what

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:26,680
 is going to happen tonight. When we had our first service here at KFCI on the 8th of October

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,240
 2016, the very first thing we said about this church is that we were to be a bridge builder.

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:45,680
 We were going to be used by God to actually bring together Chinese churches, international

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,720
 churches, evangelical churches, charismatic churches, the young and the old, the rich

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,720
 and the poor. And we coined a hashtag, we had it on our t-shirts, #OneChurchInHongKong.

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:07,040
 And what you are going to see in a few moments is the Church of Hong Kong coming together

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:17,400
 to produce one service to glorify God with people from different churches taking part.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 When Jesus prayed in the garden in John 17.21, one of the final prayers He prayed on the

10
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:37,040
 earth was "Father, make them one just as You and I are one." What we are going to do tonight

11
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,080
 is a fulfillment of that prayer. The Church of Hong Kong, different faces, different races,

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:03,840
 different languages coming together to worship God. So I am going to hand you over now to

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:12,920
 our host, Pastor James and Pastor Jess to introduce our service together. I pray that

14
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,320
 it will bless you.

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,160
 Hello everyone, welcome to Hong Kong Churches Combined Service. We are so glad that you

16
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,840
 are joining us today. We represent a collection of churches all dotted around Hong Kong and

17
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,760
 it is really just a great show of unity. That though we are diverse in our expressions and

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,760
 even our convictions, that we would unite to be as one. I am James. And I am Jess. And

19
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,920
 we welcome you wherever you are in Hong Kong, whether you are in the New Territories, Kowloon

20
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,560
 or Hong Kong Island. We acknowledge that during a time like this, there is one thing that

21
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,400
 is asked of the body of Christ and that is to be together and to put our faith in the

22
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,240
 one who is in complete control, Jesus our Lord. And now we would encourage you to pull

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,240
 out your phone, thank God for it and put it away. And now that God has your undivided

24
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,480
 attention, let us listen to the words of this Psalm. Psalm 146.

25
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise the Lord all my life. I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.

26
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:59,480
 Do not put your trust in princes, in mortal men who cannot save. When their spirit departs, they return to the ground.

27
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,480
 On that day their plans come to nothing.

28
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God, the maker of heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them.

29
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,480
 The Lord who remains faithful forever.

30
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 This Psalm was written at a time when there was low morale. And the Psalm, the Psalmist urges the people, as we are encouraged to now, to remind ourselves that we are in need of God, the Creator God,

31
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,480
 who in generations past have proved himself faithful and has been the help and the hope to our previous generations.

32
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:56,480
 And so the invitation to us now, as we turn our hearts to worship God, is to entrust ourselves to God again, to hope in him, to declare that he is faithful in our lives, in our world.

33
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
 Let us worship.

34
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:12,480
 [Piano music]

35
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:32,480
 The splendor of the King. Holy Majesty. Let all the earth rejoice. All the earth rejoice.

36
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:52,480
 He wraps himself in light. And darkness tries to hide. Trembles at his voice. Trembles at his voice.

37
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all will see how great, how great is our God.

38
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:40,480
 Age to age he stands. And time is in his hands. Beginning and the end. Beginning and the end.

39
00:06:40,480 --> 00:07:01,480
 Our God in three in one. Father, Spirit, Son. The Lion and the Lamb. The Lion and the Lamb.

40
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:29,480
 How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all will see how great, how great is our God.

41
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:57,480
 How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all will see how great, how great is our God.

42
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:24,480
 He's the name above all names. You are worthy of all praise. And my heart will sing how great is our God.

43
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:52,480
 He's the name above all names. You are worthy of all praise. And my heart will sing how great is our God.

44
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:20,480
 He's the name above all names. You are worthy of all praise. And my heart will sing how great is our God.

45
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:44,480
 How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all will see how great, how great is our God.

53
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:59,480
 [singing in Chinese]

54
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:12,480
 God, as we come before you, we lift our voices in praise. And we lift our hearts and bring all that we are to your throne.

55
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:21,480
 God, we pray that your spirit will be in this place. Your presence will be among us in our homes across Hong Kong.

56
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 Would you unite us with your love? God, we pray that you will use us. Use us as your church in this city.

57
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:53,480
 That we might be a light that shines in the darkness and reflects you to reveal more of who you are. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

58
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,480
 [music]

59
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 Bless the Lord, O my soul. And all that is within me, bless his holy name.

60
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 Bless the Lord, O my soul. And forget not all his benefits.

61
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,480
 Who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit.

62
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,480
 Who redeems your life from the pit. Who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy.

63
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:38,480
 Who satisfies you with good, so that your youth is renewed like the eagles.

64
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 The Lord works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.

65
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,480
 The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.

66
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,480
 He will not always accuse, nor will he keep his anger forever.

67
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:08,480
 He does not deal with us according to our sin, nor repay us according to our iniquities.

68
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,480
 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love towards those who fear him.

69
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.

70
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.

71
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,480
 Bless the Lord in all his work, in all places of his dominion.

72
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:46,480
 Bless the Lord, O my soul.

73
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,480
 Bless the Lord, O my soul.

74
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480
 (upbeat music)

75
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 - Welcome Hong Kong.

76
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
 And so please join us.

84
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 Let's get out of our seats.

85
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,480
 Let's really come together as a body and let's really pray for God's purposes in our beloved city.

86
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
 Let's pray.

 (gentle music)

151
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,480
 - We thank you that you are making us one every day.

152
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,480
 We thank you that you're watching over us here in Hong Kong,

153
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 even in the midst of all the distractions

154
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
 and all the difficulties.

155
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
 We thank you that you are still God

156
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
 and you are Lord over us.

157
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
 And we ask right now, God, that you would move in our behalf.

158
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
 We pray, Lord God, that the churches

159
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
 would continue to be united.

160
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
 Even though we're practicing physical distancing, God,

161
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
 that we will not practice social distancing,

162
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
 we would still reach out to our community.

163
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
 We still love the lost.

164
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 We pray that you would take the time, God,

165
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,480
 to bring the church into the place that you want it to be.

166
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
 And Father, we pray especially, God,

167
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
 that you would send revival to us.

168
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,480
 We know that revival starts in our heart, God.

169
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,480
 And so would you move and transform deep inside of us, Lord,

170
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,480
 that we may be the agents of change and transformation

171
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
 that you desire in our city.

172
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
 And so come, Lord God, and have mercy on us, God.

173
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,480
 And use us to lead the church of Jesus Christ in Hong Kong

174
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
 into your presence, Lord.

175
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
 And we ask that you would come in the spirit

176
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,480
 and breathe over us and breathe over our city, God.

177
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 Lord, we come, God, and we ask you to move on our behalf, Lord.

178
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
 God, we thank you. We love you so much, God.

179
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,480
 And in Jesus' name, all God's people said, amen.

180
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:08,480
 Today's reading is from 1 Peter 1, verses 3-12.

181
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

182
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,480
 By his great mercy, he has given us new birth

183
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
 into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ

184
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,480
 from the dead and into an inheritance

185
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,480
 that can never perish, spoil, or fade.

186
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,480
 This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,

187
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,480
 who through faith are shielded by God's power

188
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 until the coming of the salvation

189
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,480
 that is ready to be revealed in the last time.

190
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
 In all this, you greatly rejoice,

191
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,480
 though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief

192
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,480
 in all kinds of trials.

193
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith,

194
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,480
 of greater worth than gold, which perishes

195
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,480
 even though refined by fire, may result in praise, glory,

196
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,480
 and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed.

197
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,480
 Though you have not seen him, you love him.

198
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 And even though you do not see him now,

199
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,480
 you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible

200
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,480
 and glorious joy, for you are receiving

201
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,480
 the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

202
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,480
 Concerning this salvation, the prophets,

203
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,480
 who spoke of the grace that was to come to you,

204
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,480
 searched intently and with the greatest care,

205
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 trying to find out the time and circumstances

206
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,480
 to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing

207
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,480
 when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah

208
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,480
 and the glories that would follow.

209
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves

210
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,480
 but you, when they spoke of the things

211
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,480
 that have now been told you by those who have preached

212
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,480
 the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.

213
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,480
 Even angels long to look into these things.

214
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,480
 Consider the role of hope in our lives.

215
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,480
 Think of little Jimmy, off to his first day at school,

216
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
 already looking forward to meeting little Jane

217
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
 in the playground.

218
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,480
 At 10 years and one side or the other,

219
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
 he's hoping to be asked out on a date,

220
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,480
 hoping their skin will clear up, hoping to achieve

221
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
 certain grades, hoping to get a spot on the sporting team

222
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
 or land a part in the school production,

223
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
 hoping to get into the right university,

224
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 hoping for career success, to make a contribution,

225
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
 to make a difference in life.

226
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
 If marriage comes along, hoping it will last.

227
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,480
 If kids arrive, hoping that they will grow up functional

228
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
 and healthy.

229
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,480
 When the first serious illnesses come,

230
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
 hoping that they'll get through it.

231
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
 Our lives are filled with hope.

232
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
 Hope gives us a sense of direction.

233
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
 It dictates how we live in the present,

234
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,480
 how we spend our time and our money, which jobs we take,

235
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,480
 what we plan for the future.

236
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,480
 What do you do if some of those things that you hope for

237
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 are threatened?

238
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,480
 It could be something particular to your situation,

239
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,480
 a job loss, an illness, a relationship breakdown,

240
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
 or it could be something more general to cast a shadow

241
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,480
 over everyone, protests or pandemics.

242
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,480
 Normally, people respond to threats in one of two ways,

243
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
 distraction or distress.

244
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
 You get distracted.

245
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,480
 You turn off the news and turn on Netflix.

246
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,480
 You get absorbed in work or plan the next holiday

247
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,480
 or avoid those deeper conversations with people.

248
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
 Anything to stop thinking about the threats to you.

249
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
 Or you get distressed.

250
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
 Yes, we should weep with those who weep,

251
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,480
 but there is a sense in which we start to feel every threat,

252
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,480
 every insecurity, every attack, every injustice,

253
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,480
 and we live in this constant state of tension,

254
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,480
 waiting for the next threat to come.

255
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,480
 Now, that first option doesn't treat life seriously,

256
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 and the second option is not sustainable.

257
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,480
 And so maybe you begin to question,

258
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,480
 where can I get a hope that can't be taken away?

259
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,480
 Where can I have a hope that will face anything?

260
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
 In the reading that we just heard,

261
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,480
 the Apostle Peter says something incredible.

262
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
 He says, "In his great mercy,

263
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,480
 God has given us a new birth into a living hope."

264
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 Peter is speaking about the Christian hope,

265
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,480
 something which transcends both distraction and despair,

266
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,480
 which lifts our eyes from the horizon of this present world

267
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,480
 and connects us with the gift that God offers,

268
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
 which cannot be taken away.

269
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
 And so as we look at this passage, we'll see two things.

270
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,480
 What is this hope, and how does it work in our lives?

271
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,480
 Peter speaks about this hope in verses three to five,

272
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 and he tells us two things about it.

273
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,480
 He says, first of all, that this hope is sure.

274
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,480
 Verse three, "Praise be to the God and Father,

275
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 our Lord Jesus Christ.

276
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 In his great mercy, he has given us a new birth

277
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,480
 into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ

278
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
 from the dead."

279
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,480
 Now, we normally think that hope is something that is uncertain.

280
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,480
 We desire it, but we don't know if it's going to come.

281
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 I hope I get that job.

282
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
 I hope that it doesn't rain tomorrow.

283
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 But Peter looks at Christian hope as being something different.

284
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,480
 It's not something that is uncertain,

285
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
 but it is something that is certain

286
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,480
 because of what has happened in the past.

287
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,480
 For Peter, Jesus' resurrection is a life-changing event.

288
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,480
 When Jesus died, hope was lost.

289
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
 For Peter, he would have been thinking,

290
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,480
 "How could God bring anything good out of this situation?"

291
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,480
 He was just left with bitter sorrows and denial.

292
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,480
 But Jesus didn't stay dead.

293
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,480
 On that Easter Sunday morning, the tomb was empty,

294
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,480
 and Jesus appeared to Peter, and hope was reborn.

295
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,480
 The resurrection means more than simply the restoration of Jesus.

296
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,480
 The resurrection means that God has made the crucified Jesus,

297
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
 both Lord and Christ.

298
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,480
 He now rules. He controls everything.

299
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,480
 If Jesus has the power to rise from the dead,

300
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,480
 then he has power over your death.

301
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
 When your earthly days come to an end,

302
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,480
 something so extraordinary will come to pass

303
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
 that a great change will happen,

304
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,480
 and you'll pass through death into eternal life.

305
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,480
 Peter's hope, the hope that the Bible speaks about,

306
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
 is something that is certain.

307
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,480
 It's a sure hope for the future

308
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,480
 because of what has happened in the past, Jesus' resurrection.

309
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,480
 So this hope is sure, but secondly, it is lasting.

310
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,480
 Verse 4, "The object of this hope is an inheritance

311
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,480
 that can never perish, spoil, or fade.

312
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
 This inheritance is kept in heaven for you."

313
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,480
 In the Old Testament, God gave the people of Israel

314
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
 an inheritance of land.

315
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,480
 Every tribe was given an allocation of land

316
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,480
 with the promise of a lasting ownership.

317
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
 Whilst they were wandering around in the wilderness,

318
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,480
 it was this promise of an inheritance that they held on to.

319
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,480
 But the inheritance that Peter is speaking about is heaven.

320
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,480
 But you notice what he says about it.

321
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,480
 It can never perish, spoil, or fade.

322
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,480
 Everything, everything that you can ever have or own,

323
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
 everything that you can ever inherit from your family,

324
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
 everything that you can ever make,

325
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,480
 everything has a use by date.

326
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
 Everything wears away or fades.

327
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
 Everything can be taken away or destroyed.

328
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
 Nothing lasts except for this.

329
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,480
 This promise of an eternal inheritance

330
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
 that comes to those who trust in Jesus.

331
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,480
 Now this inheritance is our home.

332
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,480
 It's where we belong, but we're not there yet.

333
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
 It's being kept for you. It's ready.

334
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,480
 This salvation doesn't need a few final touches

335
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
 to make it better.

336
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,480
 It's not like we're consultants who are brought in

337
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
 to have a hand in its design.

338
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,480
 No, it's there. It's a finished salvation.

339
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,480
 It's perfect and complete and unchangeable,

340
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
 just like God.

341
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
 Do you see what this Christian hope is?

342
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,480
 It's a life-shaping, joyful certainty

343
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,480
 in something that has been promised to you.

344
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,480
 And it is absolutely vital.

345
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
 Why? Well, look at who Peter is writing to.

346
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
 In verse 6, he says they're suffering through

347
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
 all sorts of trials.

348
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,480
 Here are people who are experiencing

349
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
 all sorts of difficulties because of their faith in Jesus,

350
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
 the loss of their reputation and homes,

351
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,480
 their health and freedoms, even their very lives.

352
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
 Many years ago, I read this book called

353
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
 Man's Search for Meaning.

354
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,480
 It's by Viktor Frankl, who was a psychiatrist.

355
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,480
 He was also Jewish and a survivor of Auschwitz.

356
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,480
 In one part, he says this,

357
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,480
 "The prisoner who had lost faith in the future,

358
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,480
 his future, was doomed.

359
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,480
 He let himself decline and become subject

360
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
 to mental and physical decay.

361
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
 Usually this happened quite suddenly in the form

362
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
 of a crisis, the symptoms of which were familiar

363
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
 to the experienced camp inmate.

364
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
 Usually it began with the prisoner refusing

365
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
 one morning to get dressed and wash

366
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
 or to go out in the parade grounds.

367
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,480
 No entreaties, no blows, no threats had any effect.

368
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,480
 He just lay there, hardly moving.

369
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
 If this crisis was brought about by an illness,

370
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,480
 he refused to be taken into the sick bay

371
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
 or to do anything to help himself.

372
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
 He simply gave up.

373
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,480
 There he remained, lying in his own excreta,

374
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,480
 and nothing bothered him anymore."

375
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,480
 Hope is absolutely necessary for life.

376
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,480
 And Frankl talked about the different things

377
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
 that those campmates put their hope in.

378
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
 And what he said was vital.

379
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,480
 He said that many people held on to the hope

380
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,480
 that if they stayed alive during that time,

381
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,480
 then their health, their family, their jobs

382
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,480
 or their position in society would be restored to them.

383
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
 That if they could just stay alive,

384
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
 everything would go back to normal.

385
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
 It'd be like they'd just woken up out of a dream

386
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,480
 and things would be okay.

387
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
 But after the war and liberation,

388
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
 many of them found things to be very different.

389
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,480
 Perhaps some of their old situation had come back to them,

390
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,480
 but it didn't compensate for what they had suffered.

391
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,480
 They couldn't get over the grief and injustice,

392
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
 and many of them slipped into a depression.

393
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,480
 Some of them even took their own lives.

394
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,480
 But Frankl observed that a few remained buoyant,

395
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,480
 not happy, but they could handle things.

396
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
 So what was the difference?

397
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,480
 Well, it was if people held on to something

398
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,480
 that couldn't be taken away from them in this life.

399
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
 When a new prisoner came into the camp,

400
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,480
 Frankl would counsel them saying,

401
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
 "Someone from heaven is looking down from you."

402
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,480
 And he'd speak to them about a friend or a spouse or God,

403
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,480
 and he'd say, "You don't want to disappoint them."

404
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
 That's what he figured out.

405
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,480
 He said that anything finite in this life

406
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
 can be taken away from you.

407
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
 Anything can be taken away.

408
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
 It's subject to decay, it can be broken.

409
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
 It doesn't last.

410
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
 It's here one moment, go on the next.

411
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
 Even the good things, your family, your health,

412
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,480
 your achievements, here one moment, go on the next.

413
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,480
 And I think sometimes you and I forget this.

414
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
 Consider Steve.

415
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,480
 Steve is a Christian.

416
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
 He turns up to church not just a few times a month.

417
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
 He comes every week.

418
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
 Steve believes in the Bible.

419
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
 He reads it all the time.

420
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,480
 He believes what the Bible says about God

421
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
 and what the Bible says about the human condition.

422
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,480
 He says the Bible is the most satisfying explanation

423
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
 for the meaning in life.

424
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
 And Steve is a moral guy.

425
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,480
 His friends quietly admire how he treats other people,

426
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,480
 his integrity in the workplace, and his honesty.

427
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,480
 But Steve is deeply secular.

428
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
 He believes that he's going to wake up in his bed

429
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
 the next morning.

430
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
 That word secular comes from the Latin word

431
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,480
 'seculum' which means 'this life'.

432
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,480
 Everything that we need to find out meaning and purpose

433
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
 comes from this life.

434
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,480
 Steve believes in God, but the reality is

435
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,480
 his hopes are in this life.

436
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
 His ambitions and plans, how he conducts himself,

437
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
 are all about this life.

438
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,480
 Steve believes in heaven, but it's just that

439
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
 he doesn't think about it very much.

440
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,480
 His ambitions and actions are all about this life

441
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,480
 and not the next.

442
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,480
 And there is a possibility that you and I can be

443
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
 very much like Steve.

444
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,480
 We say we follow Jesus, but our hopes are fixed

445
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
 in this life and not the next.

446
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,480
 A kind of spiritual myopia sets in.

447
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,480
 A short-sightedness where all that we can see,

448
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
 all that we hope for is that which is just right

449
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
 in front of us.

450
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,480
 We forget about the future that God is calling us to,

451
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,480
 all the things that are happening in 10,000 years

452
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
 from now.

453
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,480
 And so when something comes along that threatens

454
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,480
 or even takes away what you hope for in this life,

455
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
 you find it incredibly hard to get over it.

456
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,480
 You lose your calm and your peace because

457
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,480
 you've lost hold of the hope that Peter is speaking about.

458
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,480
 This life-shaping, joyful certainty in something

459
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,480
 that has been promised to you.

460
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
 That's the Christian hope.

461
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,480
 So how does it work in your life?

462
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,480
 Well, firstly, it gives you joy through suffering.

463
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,480
 Notice verse 6, "In all this you greatly rejoice,

464
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
 though now for a little while you may have had

465
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,480
 to suffer grief in all kinds of trials."

466
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
 Did you see the paradox there?

467
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,480
 Peter doesn't say you're rejoicing even though beforehand

468
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
 you suffered all kinds of grief.

469
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,480
 No, he's saying both are happening somehow

470
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
 at the same time.

471
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,480
 You're rejoicing now, you have joy,

472
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,480
 even though right now you're experiencing these trials.

473
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
 How is that possible?

474
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,480
 How is it possible to be in a situation where you experience

475
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,480
 not just the difficulties that are common to everyday life,

476
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,480
 but also the hardships that are particular to being a Christian?

477
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,480
 And yet, these things do not drag you down

478
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,480
 and make you bitter, hating life and the people

479
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
 who cause this difficulty for you.

480
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,480
 Instead, you have this inner poise, this calm,

481
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,480
 this confidence, a joy that cannot be taken away

482
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
 despite circumstances.

483
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,480
 Well, it's possible in part because of what Peter says next

484
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,480
 in verse 7, "These things have come so that the proven genuineness

485
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,480
 of your faith, of greater worth than gold, which perishes,

486
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,480
 even though refined by fire, may result in praise, glory,

487
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,480
 and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed."

488
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
 Peter uses this illustration.

489
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,480
 What happens when you put gold in fire?

490
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,480
 The gold isn't destroyed, it's purified and refined.

491
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,480
 It becomes more beautiful.

492
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,480
 And Peter says the same thing that is happening to us.

493
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,480
 Suffering proves the genuineness of our faith.

494
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,480
 It refines us, making us even more beautiful.

495
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,480
 Look, what do you think is the best thing that you can do in life?

496
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,480
 Doesn't Jesus say it's to learn to love God with all your heart,

497
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
 soul, mind and strength and to love your neighbour as yourself?

498
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
 It's to forget yourself.

499
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,480
 Once we learn that, we're more the people that God wants us to be.

500
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,480
 But what do you think would stop us getting there?

501
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,480
 Isn't it the obsession with self, with getting what we want

502
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,480
 all the time, with building our own little kingdoms?

503
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,480
 Now, if God were going to help us to be who we're supposed to be,

504
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,480
 to get rid of this self-obsession, how would he go about that?

505
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,480
 Wouldn't he threaten or even take away those things that we love

506
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
 more than him?

507
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,480
 Through the difficulties or traumas in life, he'd be reminding us

508
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,480
 that he alone is all that we could ever want or need.

509
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,480
 He alone is everlasting.

510
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,480
 Now, because God is both loving and sovereign,

511
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
 our suffering has meaning.

512
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,480
 We may not be always able to see it, but we can trust God

513
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,480
 even though we don't understand it all.

514
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,480
 If your hope is based on getting particular circumstances,

515
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,480
 then when suffering comes along, you're devastated.

516
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,480
 But if your hope is not based on these particular circumstances

517
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:36,480
 but based in God, then you have a joy that cannot be taken away.

518
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,480
 But there is that paradox.

519
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,480
 Yes, there is the pain, the difficulties of going through life,

520
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,480
 but also you have this indescribable joy

521
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,480
 because you're learning that in him you have everything

522
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
 that you could ever want.

523
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,480
 But you're also learning that through suffering you're being

524
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
 refined like gold.

525
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,480
 You're becoming more and more the person that God wants you to be.

526
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 You're becoming something far more beautiful.

527
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,480
 So this hope brings you joy through suffering.

528
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,480
 But secondly, it brings you assurance through uncertainty.

529
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
 From verse 10, Peter speaks about how the Old Testament prophets

530
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,480
 pointed forward towards Jesus.

531
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,480
 He says, "They spoke of the grace that was to come to you

532
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,480
 and searched intently and with great care, trying to find out

533
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,480
 the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them

534
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,480
 was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah

535
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,480
 and the glories that would follow."

536
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,480
 In other words, the prophets couldn't see everything

537
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,480
 that God was going to do.

538
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
 They searched intently.

539
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
 They were trying to figure things out.

540
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,480
 There was something to them which were uncertain.

541
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,480
 But there was one thing that was certain.

542
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,480
 Verse 11, "The sufferings of the Messiah and the glories

543
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
 that would follow."

544
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
 That was the pattern.

545
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,480
 Sufferings first and then glories to come.

546
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
 Do you see our privilege?

547
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
 We know far more than the prophets.

548
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
 We're on this side of the cross.

549
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,480
 We can see how Jesus fulfilled everything that they predicted.

550
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,480
 But more than that, we can see the extent of God's love for us,

551
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,480
 that he gave his Son to take on our own brokenness and sin

552
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,480
 through his suffering on our behalf.

553
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,480
 And therefore, we have this incredible assurance

554
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,480
 that regardless of the circumstances that come in life,

555
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,480
 what God has promised, he will deliver.

556
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
 Look, when you go through difficult times

557
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,480
 or something traumatic happens, sometimes you get a sense

558
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,480
 of uncertainty and you say, "Why is this happening?

559
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
 Have I done something wrong?

560
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
 Is God angry with me?

561
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
 Has God left me?"

562
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,480
 You do this because somewhere in your heart, you still think,

563
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,480
 "If I live a good life, good things should happen to me.

564
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
 I shouldn't suffer."

565
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,480
 But when suffering comes along, you begin to question God,

566
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,480
 his love and his purposes for you.

567
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,480
 But that's not the Christian hope because you've forgotten somebody.

568
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,480
 There is only one person who ever lived the perfect life,

569
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,480
 and yet he was a man of sorrows.

570
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,480
 He was rejected and betrayed, tortured and crucified.

571
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,480
 He suffered and yet he went into glory.

572
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,480
 That was the pattern that the prophets saw about the Messiah

573
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,480
 and that pattern still applies, suffering now, glory to come.

574
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,480
 That's the hope that Peter says.

575
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,480
 It's a hope that is being kept for you.

576
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,480
 And so we can have this incredible assurance of God's love

577
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,480
 that despite the circumstances of life, what God has promised,

578
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,480
 he will deliver.

579
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,480
 This is the Christian hope, a hope that does not distance us

580
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,480
 from the pain of this world, nor does it distract us

581
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
 from the injustices that we see.

582
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,480
 It's a hope that reminds us of God's faithfulness in the past.

583
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,480
 It shapes our present and it focuses our mind and our hearts

584
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
 towards the glory to come.

585
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,480
 Adoniram Judson was one of the first missionaries to Burma.

586
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,480
 He planted churches, translated the Bible,

587
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,480
 but he suffered incredibly, spending long times in prison.

588
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,480
 And during a particular difficult time, he wrote this,

589
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,480
 "I do not believe I'm going to die yet.

590
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,480
 Oh, I feel as though I've only just been prepared for usefulness.

591
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,480
 It's not that I shrink from death that I wish to live,

592
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,480
 neither is it the ties that bind me here, though some of them

593
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
 are very sweet.

594
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
 They do not bear any comparison with the drawings I feel

595
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
 towards heaven.

596
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,480
 But a few years will not be missed from my eternity of bliss

597
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,480
 and I can well afford to spare them for the sake of the poor Burmans.

598
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,480
 I'm not tired of my work, neither am I tired of the world.

599
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,480
 Yet when Christ calls me home, I shall go with all the gladness

600
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,480
 of a boy bounding away from his school."

601
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
 Let's pray.

602
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,480
 Lord God, we do thank you for this sure and certain hope

603
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
 that you've given us through the resurrection of Jesus

604
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
 from the dead.

605
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,480
 And we ask for your forgiveness for all the ways in which we put

606
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,480
 our hopes in the things of this world above and beyond you.

607
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,480
 Lord, help us to enthrone Jesus in our lives,

608
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,480
 to live for him and serve him because he has done everything

609
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
 for us.

610
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
 We ask for your help by your Spirit.

611
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,480
 In the name of your Son, Jesus, amen.

612
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:53,480
 So church, we're going to do a bit of a new song.

613
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
 The song is called "The Blessing" and the reason that we chose

614
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,480
 to sing this song is it echoes a prayer that's found in Scripture.

615
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,480
 And the highlights of this prayer is not just that God will bless

616
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,480
 you but that he'll be for you, that he'll be with you.

617
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,480
 And I think for all of us in the season that we're in now,

618
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,480
 it's a great reminder to know that wherever we go,

619
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,480
 however difficult it gets, he doesn't run off,

620
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,480
 but he stays with us.

621
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
 He goes before us, in fact.

622
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,480
 He is with us, he is behind us, he is all around us.

623
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,480
 And having that presence with us means all things can be possible.

624
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,480
 So I pray that this song blesses you.

625
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,480
 I pray that this song allows you to remember a God who is with you.

626
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,480
 I pray that it brings courage and hope back into your life.

627
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:51,480
 [music]

628
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:58,480
 Lord bless you and keep you.

629
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,480
 Make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.

630
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:23,480
 Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.

631
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,480
 Lord bless you and keep you.

632
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:37,480
 Make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.

633
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:54,480
 Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.

634
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:08,480
 Amen, amen, amen.

635
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:23,480
 Amen, amen, amen.

636
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:30,480
 Lord bless you and keep you.

637
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:37,480
 Make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.

638
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:50,480
 Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.

639
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:57,480
 We're singing amen.

640
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:05,480
 Amen, amen.

641
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:19,480
 Amen, amen, amen.

642
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:34,480
 Amen, amen, amen.

643
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:54,480
 Amen, amen, amen.

 So that concludes our service today.

667
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,480
 Wherever you find yourself, I hope that you have been blessed.

668
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,480
 From all of the churches here in Hong Kong who have combined their efforts,

669
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,480
 have linked their arms together to provide for you a unified service

670
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,480
 that ministers deeply to your soul and reminds you of the strength

671
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,480
 and the confidence that we have as followers of Jesus Christ.

672
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,480
 In many church traditions, churches close with what is called a benediction.

673
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:17,480
 Not all churches do this, but that word benediction simply means good words.

674
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,480
 Let me leave you today with these good words found in the book of Jude in the New Testament.

675
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,480
 Verse 24 says this, "To him who is able to keep you from stumbling

676
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,480
 and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.

677
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,480
 To the only God our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority

678
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,480
 through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages, now and forevermore. Amen."

679
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,480
 [music]

680
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,480
 I don't know about you, my heart feels really warm

681
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:02,480
 watching the people from different churches in our city worshipping together.

682
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,480
 And this is not the end of it.

683
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:12,480
 We're planning as a city to come together to fast for Hong Kong.

684
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,480
 The reason we're fasting? We love our city.

685
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:23,480
 And on the days of 28th, 29th and 30th of May,

686
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,480
 the Church of Hong Kong is going to be coming together to fast.

687
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,480
 Now I know what you're saying, I've never fasted before, I don't understand it.

688
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:40,480
 What we're going to do is next week I'm going to bring you a special teaching on fasting.

689
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,480
 And then on the 28th, 29th and 30th, we as Kong Fook Church,

690
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:52,480
 as three languages, six congregations, will be coming together for a special devotional.

691
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,480
 Pastor Peter will write one day, Pastor Paul Lam from our Mangler Inn congregation will write one day,

692
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,480
 and I will write one of the days.

693
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:13,480
 And on Sunday May 31st, the day of Pentecost, we will come together for a special prayer meeting as one church.

694
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,480
 Now while I'm talking about dates, can I remind you of a few things?

695
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,480
 Next week on Tuesday 12th of May, from 7 till 10,

696
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:29,480
 we will be doing an outreach with Christian Concern for the Homeless.

697
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,480
 A chance for us not to just do church but to be church.

698
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,480
 To reach out to those less fortunate in our society.

699
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:46,480
 I'd ask you to indicate your interest in this, but for this we're asking only Chinese speakers come along.

700
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,480
 So unfortunately, I'm sick one don't want, I won't be able to be part of this.

701
00:56:52,480 --> 00:57:04,480
 Also next week on May 17th, Friday May 17th, we will be hosting our first ever Alpha Online.

702
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,480
 I want you to think about which of your friends, you don't even have to bring them anymore,

703
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,480
 they just need to go online to hear about Jesus.

704
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:24,480
 Please register for that course and register your friends Friday May 17th Alpha Online.

705
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,480
 As I say we'll be back next week, I'll be teaching on fasting.

706
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:42,480
 And the week after that we will begin a 4 week series on Esther because you were born for such a time as this.

707
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,480
 God bless you and we'll see you next week.

708
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:57,480
