[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Hello, good evening everyone.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Good evening.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.360]   So today we're beginning a new series.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.400]   Does anybody know which book we're studying?
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.560]   Good.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.520]   You guys all know how to cheat, right?
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   It's right there.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.440]   So it's the First Corinthians.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.700]   Now I do want to give some background and also prepare ourselves for the next few weeks
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.480]   on what this is about.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.080]   Now First Corinthians was a letter written by Paul in around 54 to 55 AD.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.700]   So today we'll be looking at the topic of Paul's ministry in Corinth, this place.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.080]   So let's have a look at a quick timetable.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.160]   I mean I tried to get the whole thing on but it was too small.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.480]   So I'll show you the little bits.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.420]   So Paul was converted from Saul, God opening his eyes, around 31 to 36 AD, we don't quite
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.420]   know.
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.860]   But then he wrote the First Corinthians around 54 to 55 AD.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.300]   You're like, "What does that have to do with me?"
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.380]   It's just background information so that we all know.
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.280]   So what happened was that Paul went on these missionary trips.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.260]   So on his second round he was actually at Corinth and that was the place where he helped
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.420]   build the church there.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.780]   So that's why after he left those people were still connected to him and then they wrote
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.620]   letters, not emails then, letters to him telling him what's going on there and what the issues
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.620]   were.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620]   Now what were the issues at Corinth?
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.500]   Well there were divisions among the Christians.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.160]   They were about many things.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.740]   For example about immorality, party strife, they were about spiritual gifts and some doctrine
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.960]   and also ethical issues.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.260]   So some of them were fighting, some of them were not, but just having discussions.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.700]   So basically Paul is going to use this letter to address many issues that they have been
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.540]   having trouble with.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.740]   So for the next few weeks we'll be looking at these topics just for you to have an idea.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.340]   The next slide, basically it will show that we'll have eight, the next one, we'll have
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.020]   eight weeks of this topic where we look at different aspects.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.500]   Now a little bit of a background, Corinth is in Greece so we can look at the map just
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   for a bit.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.580]   Just give you an idea of where it is and basically it's a city where it's very prosperous.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.500]   So there was a lot of diversity, there were a lot of people, commerce trading, but also
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.660]   sexual immorality was also quite present in this entire city as well as there were other
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.100]   religions there.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.740]   So people were practicing different kinds of religion and that's why the people, the
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.340]   converts, the believers in Corinth also have trouble because the society is dealing with
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.620]   things like this and they themselves are a little bit confused as well.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.660]   So it's a metropolitan city kind of like Hong Kong and New York is a very important city
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.300]   at that time, kind of equal to Rome and Ephesus.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.900]   So you can look at us kind of in a very similar background where there's a lot of kind of
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.700]   a secular world and how they're dealing with things, but also the church is right there
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.980]   in the middle.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.220]   So we are trying to now kind of look at today what Paul's ministry is there at Corinth.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.980]   And so Paul begins his letter which is kind of like the way he usually does.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.820]   What would he do in his letters?
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.460]   Greetings, right?
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.860]   You'll be like greeting the saints, the brother and the sisters, and then he would also be
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.260]   reminding them of Jesus Christ's grace.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.780]   So the first few verse, we won't be going through them, but in verse 7 and 9, 7 to 9
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.540]   which is in the first chapter, here's what Paul says after his greetings.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.580]   He says, "Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.660]   Christ to be revealed.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.580]   He will also keep you firm to the end so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.540]   Jesus Christ.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:43.160]   God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:51.660]   Now here it says that God will keep you firm to the end so that you will be blameless.
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.340]   And Paul here is addressing the different issues, right?
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.140]   Because obviously they have these divisions and they have all these issues and so they're
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.020]   not blameless right now.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.580]   But it says here that Paul is assuring them that at some point they will be blameless.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.540]   And the way that he's gonna do that is because Jesus will be the one that keeps them firm.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.380]   Now anybody here thinks you're blameless?
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.180]   When you put up your hand.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.700]   Okay, some people are laughing.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.700]   But in here it says that the church is to be blameless, right?
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.700]   Or at least will be.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.220]   But you're very smart in not putting your hand, even though you might think, "I'm very
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.020]   close to perfect, but I'm not, so I better not put up my hand and be too arrogant."
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.740]   That is the correct move from you.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.180]   But what we do know is there is something that we as Christians and followers of Christ
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.980]   should do, which is to try to progress into this blameless status, right?
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.180]   We see that.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.060]   Even though in this life we won't get there because there is still sin that we cannot,
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.260]   but then it says that one day, the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, we will be absolutely
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.260]   blameless.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.820]   Now, does it mean then we should just take a passive attitude, which is, "Well, we're
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.660]   not going to be blameless anyways, so let's just go on with our lives as is"?
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:26.220]   Well, definitely not, because one of the things that Paul really wants to address as his ministry
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:34.820]   is to let people know that, "Hey, we are all in progression to this blamelessness."
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.320]   And so how is it that we do it?
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.500]   In verse nine it says, "God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.780]   Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.780]   What does that mean?
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.780]   Well, it means that in order to be blameless, it is not from our own efforts.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.140]   Like even if I wanted to change into someone who is in certain ways, I can't do it.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.980]   And you probably can't change some of the behaviors or attitudes that you have as well.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.420]   But what we see here is that God is faithful.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.020]   He's going to be the one that does it.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.340]   But how?
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.780]   How is he going to help us to become this blameless person, follower?
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.100]   It says here, which is, "Fellowship with his Son."
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.660]   Fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord is the key.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:35.660]   So this brings us to our first point, that we need to be blameless through the fellowship
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.740]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.660]   Now I mean, it seems like all these words we know, it sounds good, "Fellowship with
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.420]   God," right?
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.660]   And then we also hear other verses where it says, "He is the vine, we're the branches,"
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.660]   right?
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.660]   Sounds really good.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.380]   But you're like, "But what does that mean?"
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.220]   Like if I tell you, "Okay, you can have a fellowship with your friends."
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.260]   You're like, "Okay, you know, we can go and eat, chat, and maybe play a few games.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.660]   I'm fellowshiping with them."
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:11.060]   But how is it that we can fellowship with God in such a way that we are going to become
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.060]   more blameless?
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.580]   We're in this progression.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.540]   How do we do that?
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:24.060]   Well, I mean, the thing that we can do to fellowship with God is that what we need to
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.380]   do, let's say early in the morning, right?
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.500]   I mean, we wake up, I don't know what your first thoughts are.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.460]   Some of us like, "Oh, I want to sleep some more."
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.380]   And other, if we're going through some problems with our lives, I'm pretty sure that's the
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.620]   first thing that comes to your mind, which is like, "Oh, how come that issue isn't solved
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.620]   yet?"
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.900]   Or like, "Oh, am I going to find the job that I want?
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.140]   Oh, I've been waiting to meet someone.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.140]   How come I still haven't met them yet?"
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.580]   Or if you're having relational issues, you're like, "Wait a minute, how come it doesn't
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.300]   seem to be resolved?
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.060]   It's like already day 300 and...
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.060]   Wait, day 1,000, let's say."
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.500]   And it just seems like the issue keeps going on, right?
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.380]   And how do we fellowship with God?
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:15.620]   Is to invite God into our minds, into our hearts right away.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.180]   You can say, instead of feeling like, "Oh, I'm never going to get out of this issue.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.060]   I don't know how to fix it.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.020]   You know, nothing's ever going to change.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.020]   I'm hopeless."
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:33.700]   Immediately, use the truth because Jesus is the way, the truth in life, right?
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.500]   Immediately use the truth that God has told us about Jesus to have fellowship with Him.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.100]   Instead of feeling like, "Oh, I'm hopeless.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.100]   I can't do anything."
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:49.180]   You're like, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.740]   Immediately think of His promise.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.060]   What did He just promise here?
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.460]   He says, "He's going to keep me firm to the end.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.660]   I'm going to fellowship with God through His words.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.100]   I'm going to remember what He said."
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.100]   And what does He say?
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   He says, "We're the head and not the tail, above and not beneath.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.420]   And we can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.900]   And imagine our day starting like that.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.760]   Maybe we didn't even want to get out of bed.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.100]   Maybe we didn't think that there would be an outcome because we've been waiting for
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.980]   changes for so long.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:30.300]   But if we fellowship with our Lord Jesus Christ, then we're going to wake up that day and we're
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.380]   going to say, "I'm all pumped up.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.300]   I'm ready for today."
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.900]   And of course, five minutes later, we go back to where we were, right?
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.420]   Then fellowship with Him again.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.240]   Fellowship with Him again and say, "He loves me and He has something prepared for me.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.020]   And He's ready even though it looks like nothing is changing, but He's working for me."
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:01.500]   And as we do that, it's like we're a plug and we just plug into this electricity.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.840]   And that's where we're going to get fueled.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.100]   So when we say we are to be blameless, we're not doing it by ourselves, but through the
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:18.260]   fellowship, this constant plugging in to God, and that's how He is going to change us.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.980]   And we constantly have that fellowship with Him.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.580]   So if there's a habit you want to change, or there's something you want to see God helping
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:33.420]   you, and if you are struggling with emotions, then this is what the Scripture is telling
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.420]   us.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:40.100]   And when we fellowship with Him, slowly but surely, we will be changed by Him and His
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.220]   words are going to help us.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.180]   So as we read on, we know that Paul's first ministry, or I shouldn't say first or second,
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:55.820]   but one of his ministry, is to help the people in Corinth and also to remind us that we are
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.980]   on a path to becoming blameless.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:06.020]   And if we want to, it says here that we can do it through the fellowship with Jesus Christ.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.780]   Now the next ministry that Paul does is actually to address unity.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:17.820]   And he says in verse 10, also in chapter 1, that, "I appeal to you, brothers and sisters,
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:24.220]   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:31.300]   you say, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you will be perfectly united
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.540]   in mind and thought."
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.700]   So apparently there were reports to Paul.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:43.140]   What was happening in that context was that some people claimed that, "Oh, I follow the
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.740]   leader Apollo.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:50.300]   I follow the other leader, Cephas, which is Peter.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:56.780]   Or I follow the leader Paul, which is the author of this book."
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.060]   And he's saying, "No, you don't follow any of these people.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.580]   There's only one person that we follow, and that's Jesus Christ, because He is the only
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.660]   one that died on a cross and resurrected for you and me."
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.820]   And so when we know that, we know that there's division there.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.700]   And actually there's division among us as well, at church maybe with your brothers and
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.380]   sister and maybe at home as well.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.900]   There's division.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:33.740]   But in here, notice it says that you, that all of you, not just some of you, all of you
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:40.980]   are to agree with one another in what you say, and there be no divisions among you,
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:46.100]   but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.140]   How can we do that?
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.700]   I mean, you and I obviously have different brought ups.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:56.200]   We have different values and things that you prioritize, I may not prioritize.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.180]   How do we have this unity?
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.260]   And it says perfect unity.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.900]   Well if we look carefully, Jesus actually doesn't, Paul here doesn't ask us to have
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.460]   no disagreement at all, but it actually says unity.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.380]   Unity is different than being different.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.140]   So I might like the color blue, you might like the color pink.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.380]   You want spaghetti, I want steak, that's totally fine.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.820]   We don't have to be the same, but we need to be in unity.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.980]   And he gives us this clue, which is in the front where it says, "In the name of our Lord
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.980]   Jesus Christ."
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:41.580]   Which means that we need to be in unity in those things that Lord Jesus Christ has taught
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.620]   us, the truth in the Bible, we need to be in unity.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.120]   But other things, we can be different.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.860]   We can be different.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.420]   And so this brings us to our second point or the second ministry that Paul is really
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:05.460]   trying to help us, which is to have unity, but in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:11.100]   What that means is, if you are still your own Lord, and I'm still my own Lord, we're
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.580]   gonna have very different standards of what the truths are and what we want.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:22.940]   But if both of us, or all of us have the same Lord, and we're focusing on the same truth,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.800]   we should be able to arrive to that unity.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.900]   Now one of those issues is because remember, we were trying to be blameless, right?
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.820]   We're on our progression on that.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.420]   But some of us might be slightly ahead, and some of us might have just been starting.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:44.940]   And so there might be a discrepancy because we're not on the same page yet, but we're
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.620]   in that direction.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:52.180]   And so Paul's ministry is trying to tell those people, "Hey, these are where your differences
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:59.180]   are, and this is where we can align ourselves, but in Christ and only in the truth."
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.980]   So I mean, what are those truths?
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.020]   And from Mark 7, 21 to 23, I don't have it on the PowerPoint, but just letting you know
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:12.580]   some of the things that Jesus has already told his disciples and also to us, what isn't
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.960]   good and what are those?
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:23.500]   Those are evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit,
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:28.300]   lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, folly.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.020]   These things we cannot agree on.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:36.820]   If someone is doing sin or someone is sinning, if someone's not following this, this is not
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.820]   telling us because we need to be in unity, even though these are happening, it's okay.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.820]   We're not covering it.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.340]   No, because many times in the Bible, not only Paul, but many of the disciples, they would
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.220]   confront these things and they will even have discussions.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.700]   If one person isn't enough, bring in two.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.380]   And if that person still doesn't change, actually you might want to kick them, not might, but
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.460]   you kick them out of the church.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:06.380]   So this kind of unity that we're talking about is not accepting all things, but that we're
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.420]   moving towards our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:17.260]   If it has to do with the truth, we need to stand firm in a loving way for each other
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.860]   because sometimes it's us that needs to have that humbleness to hear.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.380]   And then other times is where we bring our brothers and sisters back on track.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.100]   But not only that, but there are also other teachings such as like, in your anger, do
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.100]   not sin.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.740]   Do not let the sun go down while you're still angry.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:41.540]   This one I always have trouble with because I'm like, oh, it's already 7pm in the evening
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.820]   time.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.740]   Should I consider the next day because the sun has already gone down, you know?
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.500]   We're trying to cheat our way to have another 24 hours, right?
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.980]   But what it really means is that, well, if we want to have this unity, we can't just
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:01.200]   listen to some of the things that the Bible says and then disregard some of them.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.460]   We need to together be focused on our Lord Jesus Christ and that's how we'll have unity
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.180]   at home, at our church, with our brothers and sisters.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:17.380]   And if we don't do that, we won't be able to have this perfect unity.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.700]   And you know, I remember an uncle once says, you know, "Oh, you Christians, you guys are
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.700]   just hypocrites."
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.180]   You're like, "Oh, what do you mean?"
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.820]   I mean, there are many things he could have meant.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:32.660]   And then he says, "Well, you know, you guys pray for God's blessings and then if they
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.620]   follow what you do, then someone else might be losing out."
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.820]   And I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.820]   And he's like, "Well, okay, for example, you're selling your house, right?
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.840]   So you pray, 'God, please let me sell it at a really high price so that I can make a lot
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.560]   of money out of this,' right?
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.800]   And if you pray that prayer, what happens is the other person who's buying it is going
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.540]   to pay a larger amount of money and they're losing on their end, right?
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:04.580]   And also, like, if you're praying for your spouse or a significant other, you're like,
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.660]   "Oh, God, please change him or her."
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.220]   But then that person is going to be suffering because they don't want to do whatever it
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.060]   is that you might want them to change.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:22.240]   And so it seems like if we use our own perspective still, we're still going to be striving.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.980]   We're still going to have this division.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.380]   So what and how can we do it?
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.500]   Is that we focus back on God, our Lord Jesus.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:37.820]   I mean, pray like this, "God, I pray that I would sell this house at a reasonable price
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.620]   in a way that's God-honoring.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.200]   And Father, I pray that I could be that wife or that husband.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.500]   Show me what else I could do.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   Or if there's some issues, tell me how I can approach it.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.660]   Or if you have work, you know, your career might be like just off and you're not too
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.980]   sure what to do with it.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.460]   Instead of saying, "Oh, I want a high-paying job or that," pray instead, "God, where would
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:08.380]   you place me so that it would be God-honoring to you?"
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:15.780]   And when our eyes all start to verge at where Jesus is, then we're going to be able to have
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:22.580]   this unity because everybody will have their own self-seeking side of us where we want
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.500]   things this way.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:33.100]   But let us, according to what Paul is also asking the church, let us focus back on Christ
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.440]   Jesus, on their truth.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.900]   And those things that are not on the truth, try to live in peace.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.260]   Don't say, "You want to eat here tonight?
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.260]   I don't.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.340]   That's fine," or other things.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:51.580]   So allow us to be reminded that that's what we need to do.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:58.740]   And then Paul continues on, and really this other way that he ministers to Corinth, the
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:04.740]   people there, and also to us, is that he reminds us what true wisdom is.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:12.700]   Now in verse 18, he says, "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:20.040]   perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:30.260]   Now for a non-believer, seeing Christ crucified, that's foolishness because Jesus died, gained
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.980]   nothing.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.380]   But for a believer, Christ crucified is the most amazing thing.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:44.540]   Not only did he die for us, but he resurrected so that we would have eternal life forever.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.220]   That is not foolishness.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.880]   That is wise.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:56.100]   And as we read on in verse 25 to 31, it says, "For the foolishness of God is wiser than
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:02.500]   human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength."
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.020]   Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.300]   Not many of you were wise by human standards.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.860]   Not many were influential.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.100]   Not many were of noble birth.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.960]   But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.500]   God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.860]   God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things and the things that are
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:37.380]   not to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:44.500]   It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.780]   That is our righteousness, holiness, and redemption.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:55.460]   Therefore, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord."
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:02.740]   So we see that Paul says that God is using what is foolish and who the weak ones are
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:08.340]   and the lowly in the eyes of the world to shame those who are wise and strong.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.980]   So FYI, we all Christians, we're the foolish ones.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.620]   We're the weak ones.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.580]   We're the lowly ones.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.280]   And yet God uses us to be able to shame the world.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.260]   And so when we think about it, we need to have this mindset of humbleness where it's
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.260]   not us.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.580]   We haven't done anything.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.300]   Actually, in fact, we're the foolish ones.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:39.200]   We're the ones that are not born of noble status.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.420]   So this really brings us to the third kind of ministry that overall we're going to see
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:50.700]   Paul doing, which is to have true wisdom in Jesus Christ.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:57.780]   Now, how is it that we can have this true wisdom?
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:03.620]   Is not to see things with our worldly vision or understanding.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.820]   True wisdom is knowing that we're nobody without Christ.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.180]   Do you really think you're nobody without Christ?
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.940]   Most of us think, "Well, I mean, I know I'm not that much, but I'm not sure if I'm nobody
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.480]   without Christ."
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.540]   But actually when we come to realize that we really are no one without Him, we can't
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.300]   even survive one day without Him.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.920]   Then we're coming closer to this truth, to this wisdom.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.340]   And unless we have that, we can't.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.740]   If we still think, "Oh, I stand here on the stage because of me.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.540]   A part of it, it's me.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.340]   Or I'm singing worship because a part of it is me."
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.540]   Or whatever it is that you do in your work, a part of it, it's me.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:58.120]   Then we still haven't seen the fullness of His wisdom, which is, it's all about Him.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.980]   It is Him that lives in us that we're able to do anything at all.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:08.940]   It's Him that gave us that breath that we're even able to have our hearts pumping.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   And so this is a ministry work that Paul is trying to remind the people of Corinth and
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.100]   also us.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.580]   Now remember the story of Gideon in the book of Judges.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.860]   So the Israelites, they were captured by these Midianites for seven years.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.380]   So they were captured.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:35.420]   And so God has raised Gideon and said, "All right, fight against the Midianites."
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.140]   And how many men does he have?
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:44.580]   He has 32,000 Israelites fighting against 120,000.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.900]   So if numbers is not your favorite thing, it's one quarter, okay?
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.140]   25% of that fighting force.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:58.460]   So if that translates into the probability of them winning, that's 25%.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.340]   But God says, "No, no, no, there's too many of you guys.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:06.760]   Because if you win now, you're going to think it's because of you, not because of me."
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:14.460]   So he asked Gideon, "Whoever is afraid, whoever's in fear, just ask them to go home."
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.300]   So there was 10,000 men left.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.780]   So 10,000 men, God still says, "It's too much."
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.700]   But you know, 10,000 men is one over 12.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.880]   It's about, is it 8% or so?
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:35.380]   And so to us, we'll be like, "Well, 25% was better than 8%, right?
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.340]   But now we're down to 8%.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.940]   And yet God still says, "It's too much, too many people."
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.660]   So he asked Gideon, "Ask the people to go to the river.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:52.420]   And as they are drinking the water, those who lap like the dogs, ask them to leave."
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.800]   And so there are 300 men left.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:03.620]   And do you know what 300 over 120,000 men, what is that percentage?
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.700]   I had done the math with my calculator.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.660]   It's 0.25%.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.300]   That is less than 1%.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:19.380]   Honestly, I want to say that is foolishness in anybody's eyes.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.940]   Why would you have 32,000 men and not fight with them and then use 300 men?
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.440]   I'm pretty sure God can just use one.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.220]   And if you wanted to, none.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.660]   But what does that say?
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:42.300]   It means that true wisdom is this realization that we are insignificant and that it's all
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.700]   about God and his risen power.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.780]   And he is the one that will give us true wisdom.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.780]   He's the one that we need to and should lean onto.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:28:00.060]   I don't know about you, whatever issues that you're facing, whether it's marriage, whether
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:06.700]   it is your work, whether it's singleness and you're still waiting, or rather it is your
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:12.740]   working situation, maybe you think things aren't getting better.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.180]   Things are actually getting worse.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.220]   And it looks like there's no way out for I don't know how many years to go.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:28.040]   There seems to be no end to this problem or issue, maybe a health issue as well.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.980]   But if we have true wisdom, we're going to lean on to Jesus.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:38.100]   Now I still remember when I was single and I was like 20 something.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.540]   And then I still remember where I felt like, okay, I still got like 50% of getting married
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.980]   or maybe 25.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.980]   I don't quite know.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.700]   There's like a certain percentage in my mind, right?
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.220]   So as I progress older, I'm like, wait, I think it's dropping a little bit.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.780]   Wait, wait, dropping a little bit more.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:00.000]   And so over time, it just seems like, oh, it's going to be harder and harder.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   But if we, and God at that time gave me more faith that Jesus Christ is the key, he is
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.720]   the wisdom of this world, not the percentages.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.600]   He can work with 0.25.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.640]   And I mean, I'm not that young, although I am still quite young, but not that young.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.600]   And considering that I'm pregnant, even that to me was very hard.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.920]   Each year I was like, all right, you read about it.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.680]   All right, you just dropped however many percent.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.880]   And this year I'm 38.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.120]   I don't mind telling you guys.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.400]   I used to put it on Facebook, I think.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.880]   But what I want to say is true wisdom, because the possibility, I don't know, I don't want
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   to calculate.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.120]   I don't know the calculation.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.080]   But I wanted to say, oh, even my sister, by the way, oh, does anybody know?
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.360]   Okay, I'm exposing my sister.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.000]   She's in China.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.580]   She can't do anything about it.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:09.200]   So after God allowed me to get pregnant, I told her, oh, God showed me this way.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.480]   And now she's also pregnant.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.880]   She's like six years older than I am.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.680]   I mean, and she's been wanting to have a baby sometime.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:27.920]   But I always wanted to say that true wisdom isn't depending on us to solve the issue,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.560]   isn't dependent on us to figure out more things and be more anxious.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.160]   It is true wisdom in Christ.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:42.020]   It's knowing that He is our ultimate person that we depend on.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.060]   We don't depend on anyone else but Him.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.780]   Because there's just a bit of us that's still trying to depend on ourselves.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.220]   We don't, when we haven't arrived to this true wisdom.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.180]   And now this isn't an escape for those who are like, oh, well, in that case, you know
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.860]   what, let me sit back and do nothing.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:08.240]   No, just because true wisdom comes from God, we still need to do our part.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:13.380]   We still need to do whatever it is that God asked us, which remember earlier what they
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:19.740]   were, for example, unity, fellowshipping with Jesus Christ.
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.300]   You can't just, like I don't want you to have, okay, you know what, I'm just not going to
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.300]   do anything.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.300]   I won't send out my resume.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.460]   It's going to come knocking on my door.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:36.160]   I'll keep myself fat and never exercise and expect to have a baby.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.980]   So it isn't a way out for us to do nothing.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.700]   It is a way for us to be obedient to God.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:49.660]   What He says, what He tells us to do, when we follow Him and realize the outcome is in
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:57.260]   His hand, we're not going to try to grasp it because with 0.25%, He can do miracles.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.660]   He can turn water into wine.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.260]   He's the one that has risen from the tomb.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.580]   My goodness, risen from the tomb.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.500]   I'm out.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.740]   So there's nothing that our God cannot do.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:20.540]   And so the ministry that Paul really is not only to the people in Corinth, but to us and
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.700]   many of his letters, he really wants us to know the resurrected Jesus.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.660]   He wants us to be one with Him.
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:35.460]   So let us really ponder or prepare ourselves that we are to be blameless.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.780]   That is the goal and God is helping us if we let Him.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:46.140]   We're not going to become blameless if we don't fellowship with Him and continue our
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.140]   ways.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:52.500]   All we do is we might get salvation and that's it, but we're not going to become blameless.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:58.940]   But if you and I want to be His followers, we need to fellowship with Him, read His word,
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:05.700]   bow His words every day, every moment that the evil spirits try to tell us that you can't
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.740]   do this, you can't do that, or nothing's ever going to change.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.520]   That's the moment we fellowship with God.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.260]   That's the moment we're going to have a breakthrough.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.260]   And then to come together as a unity.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.380]   Don't break the unity.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.860]   The only person that wants the unity to be broken is Satan.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:33.500]   But as followers of Christ, let us not fall into that trap.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:40.140]   If God speaks to you in a particular way to ask you to follow Him, be obedient in certain
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.060]   ways, you go and you do it.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.480]   You just listen to Him and you do it.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.860]   No questions asked.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.560]   And the last thing really is to have that true wisdom.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:58.960]   Obedient on God, because He is the ultimate person that can do anything.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.280]   So we really need to surrender to Him.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.920]   I pray that this is for all of us.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:13.440]   No longer ourselves, no longer our own lords, but that He is our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:21.200]   No longer dependent on our power or holding on to the outcome, but knowing that He is
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.280]   a God who can do anything and He loves you and He will do that.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.640]   So I pray that, you know, let us surrender ourselves.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.080]   Let us not be like Saturday night Christians.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.500]   I know another time will be Sunday Christians, right?
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:43.460]   But not just like two hours coming in, check, you know, I'm done my like duty.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.960]   But that let Him change us.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.840]   Let us surrender to Him to never be the same again.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.800]   Let Him really be our Lord and Savior.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.320]   Okay, let us pray together.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.420]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:06.240]   We thank you that you're the perfecter of our faith, that you did not come to save us
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.520]   and then just leave us be.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:13.640]   But you came to save us so that we can have life more abundantly.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:20.880]   You came to save us to be our Lord so that you can change us, you can make us like you.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.500]   You came for us so that we would have life, true life.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:31.560]   And Father, we pray that we surrender ourselves to you, that every day with our problems or
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.960]   with our happiness, Father, we will fellowship with you.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.320]   You're the person that we go to.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.760]   And that Father, any day of the week, any time, Father, we remember that you are the
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.000]   Lord that does impossible things.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.600]   Help us to continue to just depend on you and not ourselves.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.680]   Father, help us to keep that unity.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.140]   You love unity.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.360]   You love us to love each other.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:05.160]   And so Father, we pray that we'll surrender ourselves more and to have you totally take
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   over us.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.720]   And we pray for the day where we see you and we be blameless because you've sustained
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   us.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   Amen.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   Amen.
