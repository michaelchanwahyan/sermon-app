[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.520]   - All right, thank you very much.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.440]   That was an awesome video.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.280]   It is great to be connecting with all of you tonight.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.480]   And we are continuing our series on Advent.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.220]   We are talking about mighty God, mighty God.
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.120]   And just like we read and we saw the video just now,
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.600]   for to us a Christ, a child is born
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.640]   and he shall be called wonderful counselor,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   mighty God, everlasting father and prince of peace.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.520]   So here's the first discussion question.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.680]   This is gonna be a more interactive,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.840]   yeah, more interactive sermon.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   What comes to mind when you think of Jesus as mighty God?
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.800]   I want you to type into the chat, what comes to mind?
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.880]   What are the first couple of things that come to mind
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.080]   when you think of Jesus as mighty God?
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.480]   I wanna see some of your answers.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.080]   Son of God, yes, absolutely.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   Thank you, Agnes.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.000]   Yeah, what others?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.440]   Maybe anybody else?
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.840]   Power, very good.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.720]   Yeah, he's powerful, absolutely.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.400]   All right, what comes to mind?
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.960]   Anybody else?
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.560]   What comes to mind?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.720]   Salvation, absolutely.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.400]   Yeah, the power to save us, very good.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   Others?
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.800]   Yeah, sovereign, very good.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.240]   Love, yeah, unstoppable, very cool.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.320]   Yeah, great answers, unconditional.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.800]   Absolutely, creator, absolutely.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.920]   Yeah, thank you so much for those answers.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.360]   That's very good.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.040]   So this, let me go back to the slide.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.680]   What comes to mind?
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.960]   This word is El Gabor.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.800]   It comes from the Hebrew word,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.600]   and this Gabor, it means it could be strong,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.080]   it could be mighty.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.200]   Some people even interpret it as hero, mighty hero.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520]   You know, hero God, he transforms hearts.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.320]   I see your answer, it's very good.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.080]   King of kings, very good.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.880]   Let's look into the story of the nativity.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.640]   Let's look at Luke chapter two.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.160]   Could Jesus be mighty God?
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.600]   And we'll see as he comes to earth.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.320]   So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.920]   in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.520]   because he belonged to the house and line of David.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.760]   He went there to register with Mary,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.040]   who was pledged to be married to him
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.680]   and was expecting a child.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.720]   While they were there,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.280]   the time came for the baby to be born.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.880]   And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.960]   She wrapped him in clothes and placed him in a manger
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.840]   because there was no guest room available for them.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.080]   Could Jesus be mighty God?
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.200]   Could Jesus be mighty God?
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.520]   We see here that there was no room available for him.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.600]   For a mighty God, there was no room available?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.680]   Could that be?
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.200]   I mean, a manger, has anybody been to a manger before?
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.640]   I've been walking past, you know, Happy Valley,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.360]   the Jockey Club where there's the horse races
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.960]   and the horses, and you smell sort of the horses
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.240]   at the stable.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.920]   Does it smell good?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.000]   It might smell better than your washroom, hopefully, right?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.400]   Have you been in a chicken farm?
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.000]   Have you been in a sheep farm?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Does it smell good?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.400]   I hope that, you know, congratulations to Josh and Mel.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.560]   Their baby wasn't born in a manger, was it?
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.200]   It was born in a beautiful hospital,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.320]   nicely clean and sanitized.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.800]   That Jesus, a mighty God,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.400]   born with no room available?
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.480]   And where was he born?
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   He's born in a dirty place with horse poop and chicken poop.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.600]   You know, it probably did not smell nice.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.040]   So there was no birthplace for this mighty God.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.960]   And what else?
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.280]   We see that he was pursued by King Herod, right?
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.440]   King Herod sent men after him.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.160]   He was not accepted by his own people.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.960]   It says in John chapter one
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   that his own people did not recognize him.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.200]   His own people did not recognize him.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.760]   This mighty God was not accepted.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.360]   And lastly, we see that this mighty God had no home.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.000]   He had to flee Joseph, Mary,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.320]   and took Jesus to Egypt
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.320]   because King Herod was sending people to kill baby Jesus.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.200]   They fled.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.320]   They were refugees.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.080]   Could this be a mighty God with such humble beginnings?
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.480]   No birthplace, no acceptance, no home.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.200]   Today, we will see how Jesus is mighty God.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.360]   He is mighty God over the physical realm.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.960]   He is mighty God over the intellectual.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.920]   He is mighty God, as we see in the next slide,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.040]   through the emotional.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.120]   Mighty God over the social and the spiritual.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.680]   Firstly, I want us to discuss here in the chat once again,
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   how do you see Jesus as mighty God over the physical realm?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.560]   Are there any examples that comes to mind
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.280]   that Jesus is mighty God over the physical realm?
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.520]   Any examples?
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.880]   Yeah, he turns water into wine.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.160]   That's so cool, right?
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.080]   He could transform the water molecules, the H2O,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.360]   into what is the chemical balance of wine?
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.560]   Does anybody know?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.120]   Uncle Vincent, should he know?
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.800]   Yeah, he changes storms, right?
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.120]   He calms the storms.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.240]   That's so good.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.760]   You guys should be preaching this.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.200]   I mean, it shouldn't be me.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.360]   Yeah, he heals people, the blind and the sick.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   Absolutely.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.640]   Parting the Red Sea.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.200]   That's an interesting one, Louis,
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.560]   because I think that might be Moses.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.360]   That's an interesting one, but I'm sure Jesus could do it.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.440]   I'm sure Jesus could part the Red Sea.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.120]   I'm not sure he did that during his time on Earth.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   All right, let's look at how Jesus is mighty
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.840]   over the physical realm in our next slide.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   Firstly, we see that Jesus was mighty before his birth,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.120]   before his birth.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.480]   In John 1, verse three, it says that all things
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.840]   were made through him, and without him,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   nothing that was made, nothing was made that was made.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.480]   It says very clearly here that all things
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   were made through Jesus.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.160]   He was active in creation, active in creation.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.640]   We see the next slide, Colossians 1, verse 16.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.160]   For by him, all things were created that are in heaven
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   and that are on Earth, right?
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.040]   Both visible and invisible, not just on Earth,
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.600]   but in heaven, oh my goodness, wow, right?
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.280]   Whether thrones or dominions, principalities or powers,
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.560]   all things were created through him and for him.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.320]   Jesus is mighty God even before he was born,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.000]   physically born on Earth.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.560]   And not only was he mighty God before he was born,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.480]   he was mighty God during his time on Earth.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.440]   Through all your examples, right, turning water into wine,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.040]   through his resurrection, walking on water, right?
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.280]   You guys had some of these examples.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   He had the power to turn H2O into this amazing wine.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.060]   I'm sure his wine was better than all the Bordeaux's
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.160]   that you have, right?
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.520]   Right?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.160]   All the Bordeaux's, all the beautiful wines in the world.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.080]   Imagine how amazing Jesus' wine could have been.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.080]   He calmed the storms, he commanded the storms to be clear.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.920]   That's amazing.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.520]   Imagine thunder just being silent.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.960]   Imagine hailstorms turning into sunny,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.920]   sunny, beautiful days.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.120]   What an amazing, mighty God we have.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.880]   He fed the 5,000.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.840]   He commanded nothing into being, right?
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.000]   That's so cool that he could turn things,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.360]   nothing into food.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.200]   He can multiply bread into thousands of bread
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.160]   or thousands of fish.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.840]   He healed the blind and the sick.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.720]   He had command over diseases.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.240]   Imagine Jesus changing, right?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.080]   Changing the cells in your body,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.560]   turning them from good to bad.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.000]   What an amazing, mighty God.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   We could see right through the microscope
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.120]   how amazingly detailed diseases are.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   And Jesus knew how to turn those diseases into good cells
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.640]   or destroy the diseases.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.600]   Amazing.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.120]   What an amazing God that we have.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.120]   How is God, next, how is God, mighty God
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.300]   over the intellectual realm?
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.260]   Any ideas, any thoughts?
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.000]   Please type in the chat.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.060]   I wanna hear your thoughts.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.560]   How is God, how is Jesus mighty God
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   over the intellectual realm?
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.320]   Any thoughts?
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.360]   Come on, you got this.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.200]   You got this.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   Anshan, you got this.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.400]   I see you guys thinking.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.320]   Julian, you have something good?
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.400]   Melanie, anything?
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.480]   How is Jesus mighty God over the intellectual realm?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.720]   Any thoughts?
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.160]   Uncle Vincent is typing up an essay.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.000]   I see him.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.720]   Never got trapped, absolutely.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.800]   He never got trapped by the Pharisees, absolutely.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.920]   Yeah, he is the way, the truth, and the light.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.800]   Yeah, he proclaimed the truth, absolutely.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.760]   Very good.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.360]   We're gonna see, next slide,
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.840]   how Jesus is mighty God over the intellectual realm.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.880]   Keep those comments coming.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.120]   Always welcome.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.320]   Jesus is mighty God over the intellectual realm,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.640]   firstly, because of his knowledge of scripture.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.480]   He had total control and knowledge of the word of God.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.000]   And we see that, firstly, right, through his temptation.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.040]   When the devil took him to the mountains to test him,
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.720]   and the devil was saying all these scriptures,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   he always countered those scriptures with,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.360]   for it is written, as we see in the next slide here,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.880]   for it is written, worship the Lord your God,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.200]   and serve him only.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.840]   He always responded well with scripture,
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   because he had command and total understanding of scripture.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.440]   Also, we see that he was all-knowing, right?
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.080]   He interacted with the Samaritan woman.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.800]   And what happened in his interaction
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.880]   with the Samaritan woman?
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.880]   He knew, he knew that the Samaritan woman was a doubt cast.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.840]   He knew the Samaritan woman was unfaithful,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.920]   and that this was actually his fifth or sixth husband.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.640]   Right, he had all the knowledge.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.680]   He knows our hearts.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.560]   He knows your hearts.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.440]   He is all-knowing.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.280]   Not only that, we see, just like Florence said,
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.480]   he never got trapped by the Pharisees or Sadducees.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.120]   His wisdom is greater than any human wisdom.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.040]   He is mighty over the intellectual realm.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.160]   Time and time again, the Pharisees tried to trap him, right?
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.760]   Will you offer taxes to Rome?
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.280]   And Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's," right?
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.160]   And give to God what is God's.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.080]   And so we see that Jesus is mighty
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.000]   over the intellectual realm.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.560]   Not only is he mighty over the intellectual realm,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.440]   he's mighty over human emotions.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   Over his own emotions is he mighty.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   And firstly, we see in the temptation of Jesus, right?
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.560]   The devil tempted him, right?
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.160]   He showed him, in the next slide, all the highest mountains.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.680]   I'll give you all this.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.200]   He tried to tempt Jesus with his eyes and say,
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.880]   look at this, do you want it, right?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.520]   We always go window shopping,
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.120]   and the windows are full of all these things we want.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.800]   But Jesus saw it and said, no, I will not be tempted.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.640]   Away from me, Satan, for it is written,
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.360]   worship the Lord your God and serve him only.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   Jesus had the full weight, the full weight, you know,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.800]   of the, full weight, right, on his body.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.600]   Full weight of temptation on his body.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   Yet he lifted it up, he lifted it up and was not tempted.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.480]   He is mighty God over temptation.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.800]   And we also see that Jesus is mighty over human emotions
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   because he was obedient to the cross, obedient to the cross.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.720]   And it says in verse 38 of Matthew, chapter 26,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.960]   "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.840]   "Stay here and keep watch with me."
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.160]   And he prayed to the Father,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160]   "My Father, if it is possible,
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.640]   "may this cup be taken away from me,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.320]   "yet not as I will, but as you will."
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.520]   Yes, he was feeling the sorrow,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:33.680]   but yet he was still willing to be obedient to the cross.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.800]   And it says in Philippians chapter two, verse eight,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.600]   "And being found in human form,
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.360]   "he humbled himself by being obedient
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.160]   "to the point of death."
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.400]   Even death on the cross.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.880]   Jesus had the full weight of temptation on him.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   Yet he overcame, he overcame.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.800]   All right, so we went through the physical,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.720]   the intellectual, the emotional.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   Now, next question, how is Jesus mighty God
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.760]   over his social environment?
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.880]   How is Jesus mighty God over his social environment?
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.680]   Put on your thinking caps.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   How is Jesus mighty God over his social environment?
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.340]   Any thoughts?
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.280]   I see some of you typing, some of you thinking.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.400]   He reached out to the outcasts, very good, right?
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.680]   Back then and even now, right?
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.880]   We don't associate ourselves with those we think are sick
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.080]   or unclean or those with leprosy.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.920]   You don't touch, right?
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.440]   You don't want to become unclean and have leprosy yourself.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   Brings in social outcasts, yes.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   Didn't get, yeah, overcome by peer pressure, very good.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.240]   He ate with tax collectors and sinners, very good.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.640]   You guys are awesome.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   Pastor John is very good with these answers.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.360]   Let's, maybe he looked into my slides.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.800]   I think that's what happened.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   Let's look into the next slide,
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   how Jesus was mighty God over his social circumstances.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.680]   He connected with women, right?
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680]   Back then, women did not have position, couldn't be CEOs,
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.880]   couldn't maybe vote or own property back then,
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.200]   but Jesus connected with women, right?
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.480]   The Samaritan woman even questioned,
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.480]   how is it that you, a Jew, a man, a Jewish man,
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.040]   is talking with me, a Samaritan woman?
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.000]   How is it that you are a prophet
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.480]   and you're connecting with me, possibly a social outcast?
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.240]   Jesus connected with women.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.360]   He spent time with Mary and Martha and comforted them.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.360]   He allowed this woman to pour perfume onto him
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.120]   and wash him with her hair.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.280]   And the Pharisees were like,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.800]   how is it that your teacher allows sinners to come,
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   adulterous people to come and touch him and be with him?
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.320]   Jesus was counter-cultural.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.200]   Jesus was counter-cultural.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.960]   Jesus forgave tax collectors and sinners.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.640]   He forgave Zacchaeus, right?
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.480]   Tax collectors were seen as traitors
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.560]   because they worked for Rome,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.280]   but Jesus forgave him and ate with Zacchaeus.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.800]   Today, I'm gonna go to your house.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.640]   Wow, Zacchaeus was shocked.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.280]   All the people surrounded this adulterous woman
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.080]   and took up stones and were ready to throw the stone
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.960]   in it at her.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.720]   But Jesus said, "If you are without sin,
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.560]   "would you cast the first stone?"
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.840]   Jesus was counter-cultural
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   because he ate with sinners and tax collectors
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.960]   and forgave them.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   He said to the paralyzed man, "Get up and walk."
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.640]   Your sins are forgiven.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.840]   That the Pharisees were like, how is it possible?
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   This person says that you could forgive sins?
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.920]   He could forgive sins?
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.200]   Only God can forgive sins.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.080]   And that exists exactly what Jesus said,
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.240]   that he is forgiven of his sins
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.840]   in Matthew 9:6.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.320]   He touched, he touched.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   He touched the untouchable.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.640]   The sinners, the lepers, he touched them.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.760]   He asked the children to come to him.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.560]   When most people were like, push the children aside,
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.400]   they're not important.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   And he taught godly values.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.840]   He told the rich man, "Give away your possessions
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.920]   "and follow me."
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.400]   He taught that people should take up the cross.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   When the cross was seen as cruel punishment,
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.040]   he said, "Take up the cross.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.320]   "What good is it if you gain the world,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.120]   "but forfeit your soul?
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.440]   "That money is the root of all evil,
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   "but treasure, true treasure, is found in heaven."
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.600]   He was counter-cultural.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   He was mighty God over his social circumstance.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.040]   Lastly, we see that Jesus was mighty God
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.160]   over the spiritual realm.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.280]   How is Jesus mighty God over the spiritual realm?
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.040]   You guys can type your answers.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.200]   Anybody know?
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.040]   How is Jesus mighty God?
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.120]   Yes, resurrection, casted out demons, very good.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.280]   Let's see in the next slide here.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.160]   First, Jesus is mighty over the powers of darkness.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.360]   The man spoke a loud voice and said,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.200]   "What do you want with me, Jesus,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.080]   "Son of God of the Most High?"
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.960]   Even the devil, even the demons acknowledged
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.320]   that Jesus is the Son of the Most High.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.400]   Right, amazing, amazing.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.480]   Jesus is mighty over the powers of darkness.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.520]   And lastly, Jesus is mighty over the powers
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.320]   of death and sin.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.840]   Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   "Whoever believes in me will live even though they die.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.360]   "For the wages of sin is death.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.360]   "The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus."
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.080]   Jesus is mighty over demons.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.400]   Jesus is mighty over our sin.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.120]   Jesus is mighty over death.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.280]   He's the one that connects us back to the Father,
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.720]   connects us back to God.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.280]   And so we see from this that Jesus, in the next slide,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.840]   that Jesus is mighty God over the physical,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.000]   over the intellectual, over the emotional,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.640]   over the social and the spiritual realm.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.280]   As we look into the next slide,
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.960]   I remember when I was hiking one time
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.920]   and I was just so amazed.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.560]   I saw this beautiful mountain.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.200]   And at that time, I was so amazed.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.560]   And I was like, "Wow, you are mighty God."
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.160]   I looked at the mountains and the clouds
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.840]   and it was just, "Wow, God, you spoke."
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.640]   And this came to be amazing.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.240]   I remember when Ravi Zacharias came to Calfolk Church
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.720]   and he did his event.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.600]   And I was just amazed at how God had empowered this man
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.640]   to speak on behalf of him.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.760]   And imagine how smart Ravi Zacharias is.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.280]   How much more intelligent is Jesus?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.280]   He is mighty God over the intelligent, intellectual realm.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   Jesus is mighty God over the social realm, right?
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.880]   Over the emotional realm.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.400]   I remember I was counseling this student
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.840]   who had broken up with a girlfriend
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.880]   and this girlfriend was his idol.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.000]   I know some of you have gone through this.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.320]   He was going through a breakup and he was like,
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.800]   "This girl is my idol.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   She's my everything."
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.480]   And it got so bad to the point
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.720]   that he wanted to commit suicide
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.800]   just to get her attention.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.960]   And I was reminding this student day in, day out,
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.520]   trust in God, replace these feelings for this girl
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.440]   with your devotion and love for God.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.040]   And it seemed hopeless, right?
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.120]   'Cause I was saying the same things over and over again,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   but yet there was no change.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.560]   But after several months,
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.880]   he started devoting himself to the word of God.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.560]   God changed him.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.680]   And he's so devoted and passionate.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.880]   A year later, he's so passionate
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.920]   towards serving God, reading the word every day,
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.680]   serving God, meditating on his word.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.920]   Jesus is mighty over his emotions.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.880]   I saw Jesus as mighty God over his emotions.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.400]   When we worship together as a society at KFC
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   and we see each other lifting our praises to the Lord,
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   I feel Jesus is mighty over our social circumstances.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:17.040]   And when I see people coming to know Jesus,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.160]   I met a friend recently, his name is Albert,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:25.160]   and he came to know Jesus just recently,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.840]   growing up from a Catholic background.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.600]   He knew of Jesus, but never placed his life
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.600]   in the hands of Jesus as Lord and Savior.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.840]   Just last Thursday, he said,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.680]   "Now I see God's plan in my life,
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.320]   "that where he's called me, that he has a plan for me,
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.640]   "that he loves me.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:53.160]   "I see how Jesus has become mighty over his spiritual life."
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:59.160]   Now the question is, is Jesus, as we see in the next slide,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.720]   is Jesus mighty God over your life,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.560]   over your physical life, your intellectual, your mind,
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.440]   your emotions, your social circumstances?
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.360]   Is Jesus mighty over your spiritual circumstances?
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.520]   We're going to see in the next slide
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.120]   that it's all about trust.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.880]   It's all about trust, as we see in the next slide.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.520]   For the physical, who do you trust?
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.720]   Do you trust God to provide for you,
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.200]   or are you trusting in yourself to provide?
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.920]   Do you believe that Jesus is mighty God,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   that he will carry you through this hard economic time?
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.880]   Do you believe that Jesus is mighty
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.400]   over the intellectual realm?
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.520]   Do you trust in yourself for knowledge,
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.680]   or do you trust him for knowledge,
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.720]   for wisdom, for your work, for your school?
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.320]   Do you trust that Jesus is mighty God over your emotions,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.560]   your highs, your lows?
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.040]   Do you trust Jesus?
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:13.000]   Do you let society shape your values and beliefs,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.560]   or is Jesus the first priority?
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.360]   Or is Jesus the first priority?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.400]   And for your spiritual realm,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   are you depending on Jesus as mighty to save you?
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:33.360]   You depend on your own works to gain yourself into heaven,
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.400]   or do you depend on Jesus?
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.440]   And I want to end off with this verse here,
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   and it's the angel of the Lord appearing to the shepherds,
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.320]   and the angel said, "Do not be afraid, Mary."
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.760]   Sorry, I mean Mary, not the shepherds.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.400]   "Mary, for you have found favor with God.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.920]   "You will conceive and give birth to a son.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.760]   "You are to call him Jesus.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.800]   "He will be great,
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.040]   "and he will be called the Son of the Most High.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.520]   "The Lord will give him the throne of his father, David,
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.280]   "and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.720]   "His kingdom will never end."
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.200]   Is Jesus mighty God over your life?
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.120]   Will you let Jesus reign over your life
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.600]   just as he will reign forever and ever?
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.760]   We're going to respond in a song,
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.800]   and it's called "Mighty to Save."
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.000]   Maybe you've come unto our worship for the first time.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.520]   Maybe you've come many times,
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.000]   but you've never made this point to ask Jesus
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.560]   to be the mighty Savior, mighty God over your life.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.480]   You can do that now.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:57.840]   You can ask Jesus to be the Lord and Savior of your life.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.040]   If you would like to do that, you can pray with me.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.440]   I'm going to say a prayer,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.240]   and you can repeat after me
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.640]   to ask Jesus to be mighty Savior over your life.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.560]   Let's all pray together.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.560]   "Dear Jesus, I thank you for dying on the cross.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:23.680]   "I thank you for coming on earth
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.840]   "to be the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:35.000]   "I want to confess that I need a Savior.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.960]   "I cannot save myself.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.680]   "I am a sinner.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.160]   "Jesus, come into my heart.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.880]   "Be the Lord and Savior of my life.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:58.240]   "Make me the person that you want me to be.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.240]   "In Jesus' name I pray, amen."
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.400]   If you prayed that prayer,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.840]   Jesus now lives in you and reigns in your life,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.600]   and he is your mighty God.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.440]   God bless you.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:23.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
