1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,580
 - Jesus, you are the one that we live for.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,260
 This month, we remember the day that you invaded earth,

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,720
 and then you ended up defeating death.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,980
 And we're also looking forward

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,180
 to the day that you come again.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,360
 But so during this month,

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,740
 we pray that as we enjoy the Christmas festivities,

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,260
 the gifts that come, Lord, that our eyes

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,980
 will never be taken away from you.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,020
 And Lord, that we will use this season

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,740
 to really draw closer to who you are,

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,160
 to have a better understanding of you.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,020
 Lord, this book, this Bible tells us so much about you,

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,900
 but we pray that it will stay in our heads

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,120
 and drop into our hearts, Lord,

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,820
 as we explore why this season,

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,500
 what is the reason for this season,

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,220
 and why are you the reason?

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,460
 So we pray that your spirit will be with us,

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,780
 even in the Zoom arena, Lord,

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,100
 may you speak into our hearts here.

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,500
 In Jesus, in your name we pray, amen.

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,140
 So the book of Isaiah is where we're jumping to.

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,060
 Isaiah chapter nine, if you'd like to turn to it,

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,620
 but we're actually gonna, this is in some ways,

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,460
 I guess you could say topical,

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,500
 in that we're only gonna be focusing on one name today,

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,940
 which is wonderful counselor.

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,780
 And so that's from Isaiah chapter nine, verse six.

31
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,800
 And I wanted to read it to you first,

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,580
 and then I wanted to kind of really go still further

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,880
 into the one that we're looking at today.

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,920
 So Isaiah chapter nine, verse six says this,

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,260
 for to us a child is born, to us a son is given,

36
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,880
 and the government shall be upon his shoulder,

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,280
 and his name shall be called wonderful counselor,

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,280
 mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,480
 And we've heard those terms before,

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,800
 and over these next few weeks,

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
 we're actually gonna be going through

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,160
 these four names of Jesus,

43
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,400
 mighty, wonderful counselor, mighty God,

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,320
 everlasting father, and prince of peace.

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,920
 And so I wanted to give us a bit of context,

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,680
 'cause we've heard this verse before,

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,800
 there are songs written about this verse,

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,160
 we know those names, but just to see where it comes from,

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,240
 I wanna rewind a little bit to Isaiah chapter seven.

50
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,240
 Isaiah chapter seven is where we hear

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,680
 about the name Emmanuel, chapter seven, verse 14.

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,960
 So the Lord is speaking to the King of Judah

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,880
 at that moment, Ahaz, and he says this,

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,080
 therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign.

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,080
 Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son

56
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,700
 and shall call his name Emmanuel.

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,140
 We later see in scripture, what does Emmanuel mean?

58
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,960
 Emmanuel means God with us.

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,320
 So what he's saying here is that soon,

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,560
 I'll send you a sign, and the person that will come

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
 will come from a virgin,

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
 and his name will be called Emmanuel.

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
 And Isaiah chapter eight,

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
 so we're gearing up to chapter nine,

65
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,680
 chapter eight, the Lord is talking to him

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
 about an invasion that's coming.

67
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,440
 The Assyrians are coming, a very, very powerful nation,

68
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,640
 and there is gonna be a gloom that comes over Judah.

69
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,840
 And they will, in eight, verse 22,

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
 and they will be driven, they will be driven into darkness,

71
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,360
 and they will be thrust into thick darkness.

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,320
 So imagine this group of people that hear this from God,

73
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,200
 that I'm gonna give you someone,

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,520
 it's gonna be someone that's gonna be born of a virgin,

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,560
 that sounds ludicrous to start with,

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,720
 and he's gonna be called Emmanuel,

77
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,800
 which means God with us, so God's gonna be with you,

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,680
 but you will also be driven into darkness,

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
 that there's a group of people

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,660
 that's gonna come and invade you, and you will be suppressed.

81
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,600
 Can you imagine living in that kind of,

82
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,920
 with that kind of forecast?

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,760
 And then Isaiah nine happens,

84
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,240
 and Isaiah nine says this, you will be in darkness,

85
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,600
 and that's where verse two, what the video was showing,

86
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,120
 the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light,

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,800
 saying, you will be in darkness,

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,880
 but you will soon see a great light.

89
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,

90
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,640
 on them a light has shone.

91
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
 And then you fast forward,

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,400
 and it talks about what this light is,

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,920
 nine, chapter six, chapter nine, verse six, sorry,

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,240
 for to us a child is born, to us a son is given,

95
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 and the government shall be upon his shoulder,

96
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
 and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor,

97
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,040
 Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

98
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,400
 And you see, the prophet Isaiah lived about 700 to 800 years

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,880
 before Jesus actually came.

100
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,280
 So he was a prophesying, he was giving this vision

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,100
 that this Jesus was coming,

102
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,660
 but Jesus doesn't come yet for a while longer,

103
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,080
 so actually the people hearing this

104
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
 didn't get to see Jesus, but we do.

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,160
 And so for us, as we're looking at this passage,

106
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,480
 and we're thinking about what does it mean to us

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
 that Jesus is the Wonderful Counselor,

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
 I invite you to really think,

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,160
 to actually remove our modern day

110
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,360
 contemporary interpretations of Wonderful and Counselor,

111
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,440
 and look at it, what does it really mean

112
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,720
 when scripture is talking about,

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,920
 when the prophet Isaiah is talking about it,

114
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,240
 and I wanna tackle it word by word.

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,500
 The first word, of course, is wonderful.

116
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,440
 We say this word all the time, right?

117
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,940
 Do you use the word wonderful?

118
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,480
 Let's have a look.

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,400
 Some people do.

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
 Can I get a little hands up if you use the,

121
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,640
 if you find yourself, are you someone

122
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
 who uses the word wonderful?

123
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,240
 Put your hand up, oh yes.

124
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
 Okay, some people, some people don't.

125
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
 I find it's probably the more posh people

126
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,320
 who like to use the word wonderful.

127
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,040
 I use the word wonderful.

128
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,960
 I like it, but there's nothing wonderful

129
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
 in 2020 though, of course.

130
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,880
 But have you ever thought about

131
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,000
 how you use the word wonderful?

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
 Oh, you know, that was a, you know what?

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,880
 That was a wonderful meal.

134
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,320
 Oh, the light decorations are really wonderful.

135
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
 He is just a wonderful person.

136
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,700
 What a wonderful preacher.

137
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,640
 And so we use it in that kind of term, right?

138
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,840
 And what it means is just,

139
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,720
 the way we use it is kind of like,

140
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,540
 oh, that's just a very nice thing.

141
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,560
 But is Jesus just a very nice thing?

142
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,400
 He's not, actually.

143
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,000
 The Hebrew word is palah,

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,320
 which actually has a much stronger one.

145
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,500
 I think I just saw Anthony talk about this.

146
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,960
 It is to be filled with wonder.

147
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,360
 It is, what it actually means is a phenomenon

148
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,760
 lying outside of the realm of human explanation.

149
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,560
 So just stop thinking about the word wonderful

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,940
 and just think about the word wonder.

151
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,960
 That makes more sense.

152
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,500
 Actually, that's more accurate to its original meaning.

153
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,520
 Wonder is, wow.

154
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,680
 So what he's saying here is that Jesus is a wonder

155
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
 of a counselor.

156
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,600
 It is supernatural.

157
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 It is beyond, it is beyond the realm of human explanation.

158
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,840
 And I wonder whether we actually see Jesus like that

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
 or whether we see Jesus in the more contemporary way

160
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,840
 of saying, he's a wonderful guy.

161
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,080
 He was just a standup chap.

162
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,580
 He was just a good guy.

163
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,480
 No, Jesus is the wonderful counselor.

164
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,680
 He was full of wonder.

165
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,760
 He was a wonder of a counselor.

166
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,920
 And today I wanted to share with you some thoughts about it.

167
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,040
 And you guys know I always have three points,

168
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,260
 but I didn't go with slides this time

169
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,960
 because I've been doing homeschooling.

170
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,400
 Well, Christina does most of the homeschooling with Ruben,

171
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,640
 but we've been using a whiteboard

172
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,480
 and I thought it would be nice

173
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,800
 to actually have it on the whiteboard.

174
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,680
 But of course my handwriting isn't the best.

175
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,640
 So it is definitely not a wonderful handwriting.

176
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,800
 Wow, wonderful.

177
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
 What a great word, five-line email.

178
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,040
 So wonderful counselor.

179
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,600
 And there's three things I wanna share with you

180
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,480
 about wonderful counselor.

181
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,600
 I don't know if you can read my writing.

182
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,760
 The first one is, can anyone read that?

183
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
 Type it if you can read it.

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,000
 Let me see if anyone can read it.

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,280
 Handwriting is good.

186
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,000
 Oh, thank you, Agnes.

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,920
 Thank you, incomprehensible.

188
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,840
 The first word I wanted to share

189
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,400
 is that Jesus as wonderful counselor is incomprehensible.

190
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,560
 Second word is incredible.

191
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,200
 And the third word is inspiring.

192
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,680
 So I wanted to go through all of these

193
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,920
 to help us really get an idea of understanding

194
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,960
 what it really means that Jesus is the wonderful counselor.

195
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,880
 So the first word, incomprehensible.

196
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,680
 Jesus is hard to understand.

197
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,080
 Jesus is, the concept of God is hard to understand.

198
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,640
 It's a mystery to us.

199
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,960
 Psalm 139 talks about this,

200
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,320
 that there's such knowledge that is too wonderful for me.

201
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,920
 It is high, I cannot attain it.

202
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,000
 It's something that's beyond explanation.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,160
 It's something that you can't actually explain.

204
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,760
 It's not of this world.

205
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,480
 So Jesus isn't of this world,

206
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,440
 but have you ever tried to use worldly terms

207
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
 to describe Jesus?

208
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,880
 I mean, that's the only tool that we have, right?

209
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
 And so then you see the apostle John

210
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,520
 seeing very worldly things, sorry, supernatural things,

211
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,040
 and he's forced to write them down

212
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 and you read Revelation and you're like,

213
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,400
 we're natural beings trying to understand

214
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,520
 a supernatural God,

215
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,240
 recognizing that his thoughts and his ways

216
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,840
 are so much higher than ours.

217
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,360
 But so often we try and box them into

218
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,560
 what we try and understand.

219
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
 And that's where the problem comes.

220
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
 And we get discouraged or disappointed,

221
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,200
 or we even don't believe when we don't understand this God.

222
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,480
 I'm seeing a chat.

223
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,600
 Oh, so, you know, there's this idea of,

224
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,800
 we often try to understand God,

225
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,240
 but it's really just the same as like Harry Potter

226
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
 trying to understand J.K. Rowling.

227
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,080
 J.K. Rowling is the author of the Harry Potter series.

228
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,240
 Harry Potter is never gonna understand J.K. Rowling

229
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,160
 because they exist in a different realm, right?

230
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,800
 The star of this book, of this story, Harry,

231
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,320
 is never gonna understand the author.

232
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,120
 They exist in very different realms.

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,160
 So just the same as us and God,

234
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,680
 we exist in very different realms.

235
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,200
 When I try to talk to Walter, my dog,

236
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
 he doesn't understand the concepts

237
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,080
 that I'm trying to describe to him.

238
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,360
 Forget Walter, my daughter, who's three years old,

239
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,520
 struggles to understand some of the concepts

240
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
 that I'm giving her.

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
 For example, even for her,

242
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,640
 for a young human being like Alicia,

243
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,600
 who's three years old,

244
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
 she doesn't understand the concept of time.

245
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,000
 Well, at least she thinks she does, but she doesn't.

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
 One day we were catching the minibus

247
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,640
 and I was trying to keep her quiet and shut her up,

248
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,040
 so I gave her a candy and I said,

249
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,280
 "You're allowed to have this sweet in five minutes."

250
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,000
 Now I said it, 'cause that buys me time,

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,520
 and I said it in Cantonese,

252
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

253
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
 And so she was like, "Okay."

254
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,360
 And then what did she do?

255
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,200
 She said, (speaking in foreign language)

256
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,040
 "Okay."

257
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,640
 And so she didn't even understand the concept

258
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,400
 of waiting five minutes.

259
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,120
 Of course, she's a young girl, but do you get it?

260
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,080
 So if we as humans struggle to portray

261
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,160
 and present concepts to each other,

262
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,400
 how can we even understand the things of God?

263
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,320
 The things of God are so much higher.

264
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,520
 And I lead Bible studies and I meet different people,

265
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,040
 very smart people, and atheists,

266
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
 and they ask me these questions about God,

267
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,160
 and sometimes I can answer them and sometimes I can't.

268
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,040
 But do you understand that we're natural beings

269
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,240
 trying to describe a supernatural God.

270
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,120
 He is incomprehensible.

271
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,240
 Christ, though, is the wisdom and power of God.

272
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,920
 He is the mystery of God revealed.

273
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
 See, it is a mystery to us.

274
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,920
 For now, we only know in part,

275
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,200
 but soon we will know in full.

276
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,080
 You see, the job for us isn't

277
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,520
 to make sense of God right now, because we're not God.

278
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,400
 Actually, I would be very worried

279
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
 if you say you believe in a God

280
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,400
 that you completely understand, right?

281
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,480
 'Cause therefore, is it really God or are you God?

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,920
 So there's this idea that we have to try

283
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,880
 and understand everything.

284
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,000
 And actually we have this very noble and righteous pursuit,

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,480
 which is called theology.

286
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,920
 But the aim of theology is not to be able to find out

287
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
 all that we can about God,

288
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,200
 but rather to live out all we can with what we know.

289
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,600
 See, when we accumulate knowledge,

290
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,880
 it's not about trying to find out everything we can,

291
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,680
 but it is to live out all we can with what we know.

292
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,800
 So when we're thinking about God and Jesus

293
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
 as the wonderful counselor,

294
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
 we have to recognize when he says wonderful,

295
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
 he is a wonder of a counselor.

296
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,960
 He is a supernatural thing.

297
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,680
 We can't comprehend Jesus fully,

298
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,560
 but we don't have to,

299
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
 because you don't need to understand

300
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,680
 and know every single thing about how God works

301
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
 to be able to believe in God.

302
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,840
 It was John Wesley who said something famous,

303
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,640
 which was, "You don't need a complete understanding

304
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,520
 "of electricity to be able to experience

305
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,040
 "the practical benefits of using it."

306
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,160
 You don't need to understand exactly how currents

307
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,480
 and voltages and wires and all these things work.

308
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,920
 You just actually simply need to know where the switch is

309
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
 to switch the lights on.

310
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,280
 So it's the same idea,

311
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,560
 but we first have to understand

312
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,280
 when Jesus is the wonderful counselor,

313
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,480
 we're recognizing that his thoughts are higher than ours,

314
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
 his ways are higher than ours.

315
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
 It is too wonderful for me.

316
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,280
 We cannot attain it.

317
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,200
 It is beyond explanation.

318
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
 For now, we only know in part.

319
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,400
 And that is the beginning of our journey

320
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,120
 of being able to put our trust in him.

321
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,160
 So that's the first one.

322
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,040
 The second one is incredible.

323
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,320
 And I realized this about incredible

324
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,280
 is that I think I've gotten the meaning of incredible

325
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,440
 wrong over the years, just like wonderful.

326
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,120
 So when I say, "Oh, that was incredible."

327
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,680
 To be fair, I use it in the same way.

328
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,400
 That was an incredible meal.

329
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
 That was an incredible time together.

330
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,520
 Incredible, incredible.

331
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,880
 What does incredible mean?

332
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
 Incredible means something that is hard to believe.

333
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,560
 Because if you take away the word in,

334
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,640
 then it's like, is that a credible source?

335
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,920
 Credible.

336
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,560
 So is it something that can be believed?

337
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,120
 But it's incredible, which means it's hard to believe.

338
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
 So not only is Jesus, the wonderful counselor,

339
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,000
 hard to understand, it is also hard to believe.

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
 Why?

341
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,600
 Isaiah 7 says, "A virgin will be giving birth."

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,160
 Isn't that hard to believe?

343
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,000
 It is otherworldly to even present that.

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,800
 Those who are living in deep darkness get to see light.

345
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,880
 And then Isaiah chapter nine, verse three,

346
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,920
 he carries on, "You have multiplied the nation.

347
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,400
 You have increased its joy."

348
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,040
 Wait, what are you talking about?

349
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,240
 We're being suppressed by the Assyrians.

350
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,280
 How can we be multiplied as a nation?

351
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,000
 And how can we increase in our joy?

352
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,040
 It's hard to believe.

353
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,800
 It's incredible.

354
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,680
 It's incredible.

355
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,000
 And then furthermore, verse six,

356
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,800
 "For to us, a child is born."

357
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,680
 God, we're needing rescuing,

358
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,080
 and you're going to send us a child.

359
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,040
 Like for real, you're not going to send us Achilles

360
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,720
 or a Goliath kind of sized man.

361
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,000
 You're going to send us a child,

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,560
 and the government is going to be on the shoulders

363
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
 of this child.

364
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
 And this child is going to be born.

365
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,400
 Like, why don't you just come as a fully grown warrior?

366
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,520
 It's hard to believe.

367
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,000
 It doesn't make sense.

368
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,880
 It's incomprehensible, and it's incredible.

369
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,440
 And this child is going to be born.

370
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
 So this savior of ours is going to come from within our ranks.

371
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,840
 It's going to come from the human race.

372
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,440
 See, this tells me something about humanity, actually,

373
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,120
 that the savior chose to come into this world,

374
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,760
 being born, shows that Jesus,

375
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,240
 the wonderful counselor, is fully human.

376
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,440
 Do you ever say this whenever you make a mistake?

377
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
 You say, "Oh, you know what?

378
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 "I'm only human."

379
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,760
 Have you ever said that?

380
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,680
 When you make a mistake or you do something right?

381
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,520
 "You know what?

382
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
 "Put my hands up.

383
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,760
 "I'm only human."

384
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,280
 You see, that is incorrect,

385
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,360
 because it's not because we're human that we have flaws.

386
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,400
 It's because we have fallen.

387
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,240
 See, Jesus was fully human, but he didn't have any flaws.

388
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,640
 He was fully human and fully God.

389
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,120
 We were created, the original design for us

390
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,680
 was that we would be perfect like God.

391
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,640
 We were made in the image of God.

392
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,160
 So we make mistakes, not because we're human,

393
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,240
 but because we are fallen.

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,400
 And there's a slight difference there.

395
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,360
 And Jesus embodied the two.

396
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,480
 He is fully human and fully God.

397
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,880
 And for those of you who are basketball fans,

398
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,760
 maybe Johnny is the only one who,

399
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,920
 "Yeah, we're a fallen human."

400
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,160
 You're right.

401
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,800
 It's not the human part that's actually the problem.

402
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
 It's the fallen part is the problem.

403
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,920
 We actually have the capacity.

404
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,640
 Jesus has shown us that if we allow him

405
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,280
 to live in our lives, he's shown us

406
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,840
 that a fully human person can be perfect.

407
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,080
 Basketball fans, Johnny will know,

408
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,400
 there's a guy who was probably the best dunker

409
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,520
 of all time, Vince Carter.

410
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,760
 And he was described as half man, half amazing.

411
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,200
 But we have here a God, a wonderful counselor

412
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,400
 who is fully man and fully God.

413
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
 Fully man, but fully perfect.

414
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,320
 Isn't that incredible?

415
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,920
 Isn't that hard to believe?

416
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,320
 Later on.

417
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,280
 So a child is born and then a son is given.

418
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,000
 A son is, it's a gift.

419
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,480
 So Jesus is a gift to us.

420
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,880
 Like, why do we deserve a gift?

421
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,080
 It's hard to believe.

422
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,520
 What God sacrificed his son for us.

423
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,160
 John 3, 16, God still loved the world

424
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,440
 and he gave his only son for us.

425
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
 Are you kidding me?

426
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
 That is incredible.

427
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,560
 That is hard to believe.

428
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,720
 Why would he do that?

429
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
 And why would the son be willing to do that?

430
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,280
 Why would this son who was the beginning,

431
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,440
 he was the beginning, he was the word.

432
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,720
 Why did the son choose to become flesh

433
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,520
 and dwell among us?

434
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,880
 Jesus, the wonderful counselor is incomprehensible.

435
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
 He's hard to understand.

436
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,040
 He's incredible.

437
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,720
 He's hard to believe.

438
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,080
 And finally, he's hard to ignore.

439
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,560
 If you come face to face with this wonder of a counselor,

440
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,760
 you should be filled with awe.

441
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,840
 You should be filled with wonder.

442
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,480
 So my question to you is this,

443
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,520
 for those of you who profess to know Jesus,

444
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,960
 are you still filled with awe and wonder?

445
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,840
 There's a favorite song of mine.

446
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,680
 I think it's by Bethel.

447
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,560
 It's called "Wonder."

448
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,680
 And the words that repeats over and again,

449
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,800
 may we never lose our wonder of Jesus.

450
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,040
 We get so used to the Christmas lights,

451
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,960
 Advent's coming, oh, it's nice.

452
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,840
 We get to do all these things.

453
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040
 We get to buy each other presents.

454
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,520
 It gets cold.

455
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,840
 We get to go ice skating and all these things.

456
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,160
 But let us never lose our wonder

457
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,000
 and our awe for this coming King.

458
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,040
 He is the wonderful counselor.

459
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,360
 He is the wonder of a counselor.

460
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,720
 And we've only just finished in Revelation,

461
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,360
 but if you go to Revelation,

462
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,680
 and if you imagine yourself

463
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,680
 in the eyes of the Apostle John,

464
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,440
 seeing this Jesus in Revelation 1,

465
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,800
 you will be filled with awe and wonder and shock.

466
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,400
 If you go fast forward to Revelation 4,

467
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,640
 you see him sat on his throne

468
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,880
 with the 24 elders knelt before him,

469
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,240
 with the creatures that have eyes all over their bodies,

470
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,480
 that whole scene and all of them just worshiping him.

471
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,720
 But sometimes we think Jesus is just that guy

472
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,080
 who's with us when we're queuing for our lunch.

473
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,280
 And he's just a nice guy.

474
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,240
 He's not just a nice guy.

475
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
 He is a wonderful counselor.

476
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,120
 He is a wonder of a counselor.

477
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,280
 He is incomprehensible.

478
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,600
 He is incredible.

479
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
 And he is inspiring.

480
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,960
 Those elders that were,

481
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
 that are knelt before his throne in Revelation 4,

482
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,840
 they are just bowed down, worshiping him.

483
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,680
 Are we filled with that same kind of wonder?

484
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,240
 And does it inspire us to live in a different way?

485
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,760
 Just like nature inspires artists to paint

486
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,080
 or poets to write or composers to compose.

487
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,320
 When we are face to face with Jesus,

488
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,920
 the Jesus who we're celebrating this Christmas,

489
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,600
 are we filled with wonder?

490
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,240
 And does it inspire us to live in a different way?

491
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,120
 Does Jesus still fill you with wonder?

492
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,520
 Has he ever filled you with wonder?

493
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,680
 Because I wonder if he's never filled you with wonder,

494
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,120
 I've got a feeling that you may not

495
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,560
 have met him properly yet.

496
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,880
 You see, it's very important for us to still be filled.

497
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,960
 We should be afraid.

498
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
 We should be very afraid of this supernatural,

499
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,640
 incomprehensible, incredible King.

500
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,520
 And yet sometimes, especially for those of us

501
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,280
 who maybe have been a Christian for a long time,

502
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,720
 we just, we get used to Jesus.

503
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
 He's the Jesus that we keep in our back pocket,

504
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,600
 that we bring him out whenever we need some help.

505
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,040
 But he is the wonder of a counselor.

506
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,200
 He is awe inspiring.

507
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,320
 He is otherworldly.

508
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,000
 He brings you to your knees.

509
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,040
 If you, imagine if you saw Jesus.

510
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,800
 Imagine if you just saw your greatest idol,

511
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,760
 your hero from childhood or your hero now,

512
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,120
 and you're starstruck and you're like,

513
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
 oh my goodness, this person is actually here.

514
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,560
 This person that I've only ever watched on TV

515
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,360
 or read their books, they're actually here.

516
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,520
 Can you imagine that just excitement that you have?

517
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,520
 Everyone think of that person that you would love to meet.

518
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,040
 And you finally see them.

519
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,200
 Can you imagine the awe and wonder

520
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
 that will be filled in your heart?

521
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,560
 Do you have the same about Jesus?

522
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,640
 Or have we sold him short

523
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,280
 and we have we forgotten about his glory?

524
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,360
 Because of his humility, because of him emptying himself,

525
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,640
 because of him choosing to leave heaven's throne,

526
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,760
 to come into the earth as a baby,

527
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,120
 to be a child, to be born,

528
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,360
 have we forgotten about his glory?

529
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,200
 He is the wonderful counselor and he deserves to be praised.

530
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
 And even if we don't, can you imagine even the rocks,

531
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,120
 that's what scripture says, even the rocks will cry out.

532
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,800
 So how much should you be filled with wonder

533
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,160
 when you look at this coming King?

534
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,800
 Jesus is the wonderful counselor.

535
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,640
 Those are my three points.

536
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,400
 And the final thing is here, the word counselor.

537
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,320
 And again, I'm challenging

538
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,000
 our modern day interpretation of the word.

539
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,520
 You see, when we think about counselor now,

540
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,160
 we think about someone who's super nice,

541
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,160
 sitting there asking us nice questions and listening to us

542
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,000
 and processing whatever we have inside us.

543
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,920
 But actually when the prophet Isaiah

544
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,000
 was writing this word counselor,

545
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,600
 it meant a very different thing.

546
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,440
 Counselor back then was someone who gives counsel,

547
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,320
 who rules, a King.

548
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,640
 So if you were to actually translate that word

549
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
 into its more accurate meaning,

550
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,000
 the wonderful counselor is a wonder of a King,

551
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 a supernatural King.

552
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,320
 And suddenly that term just completely turns,

553
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,240
 that you recognize that this King is not of this world,

554
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,040
 that in him, Colossians 2,

555
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,200
 in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge

556
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,880
 are found in Jesus.

557
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
 Jesus is the counselor

558
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,600
 as he sits in the high council of the Godhead.

559
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,320
 As he looks down at you and he recognizes

560
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,440
 that you are a sinner, that you need to be saved,

561
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,840
 that within their Godhead,

562
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,640
 they decide it is right for Jesus

563
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,080
 to step away from his throne,

564
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,360
 to be born in a manger so that he could save you.

565
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,240
 You see, this world is currently very much lacking in wisdom

566
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
 and wouldn't you agree that we would love

567
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,240
 to have more of this wonderful counselor in our lives?

568
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,720
 This King who rules with love and kindness

569
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,760
 instead of maybe the way our leaders lead today.

570
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,520
 Have a think now, if Jesus was the ruler of this city,

571
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
 of this country or of this world,

572
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,320
 in whichever country you're from,

573
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,920
 how would things look different?

574
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,800
 Jesus stands for very different things

575
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,040
 because he is not of this world.

576
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,760
 And he calls us to the same thing.

577
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,440
 So imagine, and you know that verse there,

578
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,760
 Isaiah 9, verse 6,

579
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,800
 "For to us a child is born, a son is given,

580
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,920
 and the governments will be on his shoulders."

581
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,160
 Can you imagine a world

582
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,440
 where the governments will be on the shoulders

583
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,160
 of this wonderful counselor?

584
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,360
 Dream with me just for a second

585
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,000
 as our world seemingly crumbles around.

586
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,840
 Can you imagine what our world would look like

587
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,920
 if this child that is born, this son that is given,

588
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,120
 the government shall be upon his shoulders?

589
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,560
 What would it look like?

590
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:17,040
 Leaders may stop dealing in half truths, compromises,

591
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,920
 because Jesus declares and deals with complete truth.

592
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,760
 Leaders will stop looking to see what they can get

593
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,480
 from the people they're leading

594
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,320
 because Jesus chose to give to the people that he's leading.

595
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,280
 Leaders will look to be stopped to being just served,

596
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,800
 but will start serving those they're leading.

597
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,840
 Jesus will, leaders who are looking

598
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,280
 to build their own empire will stop

599
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,760
 because Jesus chose to wash people's feet.

600
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,240
 Jesus turns things upside down.

601
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,160
 Leaders that get more inaccessible

602
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,000
 as they get higher up in society.

603
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,280
 If their government was on the shoulders of Jesus,

604
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,960
 Jesus was Emmanuel, God with us,

605
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,800
 accessible to every human being,

606
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,280
 young and old, sinner or saint.

607
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,360
 Jesus was God with us.

608
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,960
 Earthly leaders look for prominence.

609
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,040
 Jesus sought to be anonymous.

610
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,040
 See, Jesus right now is clearly not in charge

611
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,720
 of the halls of Washington and London and Moscow.

612
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,440
 So how can we ever believe in a government

613
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,120
 that will be on his shoulders?

614
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,760
 Doesn't seem feasible.

615
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,880
 It seems incomprehensible.

616
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,760
 It seems incredible.

617
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,040
 But Jesus isn't seeking to take over an earthly kingdom.

618
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,040
 His kingdom isn't of this world.

619
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,960
 He doesn't desire to control the powers of this world.

620
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,040
 He was already tempted with that by the enemy.

621
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,960
 He didn't want it.

622
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,800
 Jesus' desire is for his kingdom to rule in your heart.

623
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,960
 Jesus doesn't desire to govern institutions.

624
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,560
 Jesus desires individuals,

625
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,760
 individuals like you and I.

626
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,520
 So I want you to ask as I finish now,

627
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,000
 is Jesus the ruler of your life?

628
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,640
 Do you seek counsel from him?

629
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,840
 Is he the king that is ruling over your life?

630
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,960
 And your concept of Jesus, your perspective,

631
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,880
 or your perception of Jesus,

632
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,080
 is it one that is like,

633
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,160
 Jesus, you are so high and above, I can't,

634
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,840
 you blow my mind.

635
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,400
 You are that incomprehensible.

636
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,120
 And it is so hard to believe

637
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,760
 that you would be born of a virgin,

638
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
 that you would be God's own son,

639
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
 sacrificing his life for me.

640
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,200
 It doesn't make sense.

641
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,640
 Yet are you inspired by this picture of Jesus

642
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,040
 to change your life, to submit to him,

643
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,240
 to submit to his rule, because he is worth it.

644
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,120
 Why?

645
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,960
 Because he showed you and I the greatest love

646
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,200
 that one could ever show.

647
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,960
 A king, the prince of peace

648
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,720
 that we can see later on in this passage,

649
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,160
 he chose to sacrifice himself to rescue you.

650
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,680
 And this Christmas, not only are we celebrating the advent,

651
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,680
 the coming of baby Jesus,

652
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,320
 we are also celebrating the fact

653
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,840
 that this baby did not stay in the manger.

654
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,200
 He also did not stay in the grave.

655
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,400
 And that he shed his blood for you and I.

656
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,720
 So it's very appropriate for us,

657
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,960
 and even in this evening, to be filled with that joy,

658
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,240
 that Christmas is coming, that we celebrate Jesus,

659
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,000
 that we get to be with family,

660
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,440
 that we get to just do all the things

661
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,840
 that we love in this season,

662
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,560
 and we can be filled with joy,

663
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,000
 but also be filled with gratefulness

664
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,720
 that this baby in a manger,

665
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,200
 that this son that was given,

666
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
 this child that was born,

667
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,960
 ended up sacrificing himself for us,

668
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,560
 and is now seated high on his throne

669
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,360
 as the wonderful counsellor,

670
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,880
 the wonder of a king,

671
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,040
 the supernatural ruler of this world.

672
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:29,040
