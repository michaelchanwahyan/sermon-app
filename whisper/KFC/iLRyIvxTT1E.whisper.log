[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Today we are going to talk about the fourth chapter.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   This picture is about a tree, or a plant, if you remember.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   I thought of a famous V-Thot, but I was afraid that people would complain if I uploaded it.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So I will use a German word.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   I heard the pronunciation, but I might have read it wrong.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It's Schadenfreude.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I will sing it again.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Schadenfreude.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Let's give Gabriel a round of applause.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Schadenfreude.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   You might have guessed the meaning of this word if you watched the video.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Let me show you what it means.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I think Gabriel might know, but let me show you.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The hint is that it is in the Oxford Dictionary.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   But it is a combination of two German words.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Schadenfreude.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I checked it online, so I might be wrong.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Schaden means damage.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And Freude means joy.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Can you guess what this word means?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   The first one is damage, and the second one is joy.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Joy over damage.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Joy over damage.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Yes, that's the German composition.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   What is this word?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I chose this one.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   If I know the Chinese name, I will use the Chinese idiom "幸"
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]  幸在樂和
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I know there is a more common phrase in Hong Kong.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It means "I am happy to see others being embarrassed."
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I won't post this one.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I thought about it for a long time, but I was afraid that people would complain.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   But you don't need to tell me what you know.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I read this when I was preparing for this talk.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   This is a common phrase in psychology.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   We don't want people to die or get hurt.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   But even if your friend is hurt,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   you might think it's funny.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   This is a common phrase in psychology.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Why did I choose this word?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Because the context is the same.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The fourth chapter is the same.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Why did I choose this word?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The fourth chapter is a summary of the story.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   In the first chapter,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   John is very unhappy and angry.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I want to make sure that you know the progress.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   What does this mean?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   What does "it" mean?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I think someone is thinking.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I will not say it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Thank you for answering.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   The third chapter talks about "repentance."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Do you think that a normal repentance should be...
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Let's say you have a friend.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   What would you do when you believe in Jesus?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Let's say you don't have any regrets.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Does anyone think it's bad to believe in Jesus?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   No? Okay. That's good.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I think in a normal situation,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   even if I'm not very close to my friend,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   let's say you're sitting here.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   You're not home to sleep.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Let's say you think that believing in Jesus is useful
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   or a good thing.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   When you believe in Jesus,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   even if you're not very close to your friend,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   you will still be very...
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Not only will you be partying.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   In the New Testament, Jesus gives an analogy.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   If there is a man on the earth who is saved,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   then there are angels in heaven who will bless him.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   This is probably...
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Even if we haven't reached that level,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I still think it's a good thing.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But do you remember what John's reaction was?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Why did I forget so quickly?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yes, he was angry.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Angry about what?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Why was he angry about the ashes?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   This is a bit further.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   We explained a little bit about this in the past few weeks.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Of course, we are a very bad person.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   A person who hurts others.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I don't know if you've been bullied in school.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I hope you haven't.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But if you have, then...
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Okay.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Imagine someone who hurts you believes in Jesus.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   What would your reaction be?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Someone who hurts you says he believes in Jesus.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   What would your reaction be?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   What would your reaction be?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Sorry?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Oh, you love that guy.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Okay, that's a positive.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I appreciate a positive response.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   But it's obvious that Vietnam doesn't respond like this.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Vietnam is angry.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Why is he angry?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   There's a saying in the back.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   What is he angry about?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   What did he say?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   He said, "I know God is gracious and merciful.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   He has a generous love, and is not easily angry.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   He has a great desire to repent and is not easily discouraged.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So he ran away."
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You might think,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   "We came back today,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   and I know God is such a good God.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So I should respond to him."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But Vietnam said, "I have to run away.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I have to run away."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   If you remember chapter 1,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   it was a few weeks ago.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   You might not remember.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   In chapter 1,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   he had to take a boat to the west.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   We don't really know what happened at the beginning.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   If you look at the first chapter of the book of John,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   it's just that John said to John,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   "You have to go there."
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   But in the book of Kings,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   he went straight to the other side.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So the whole crime scene,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   until this moment,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   is what the reason is.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   What is it?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   "So John knew God was gracious and merciful.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   He has a generous love,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   and is not easily angry.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He has a great desire to repent and is not easily discouraged.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Normally, your response is,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   "That's good. I think it's good."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   But John was angry.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   John thought these people were not worthy.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It was not worth it for God to love him like that.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   There will be an action later
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   that shows that he thought that way.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But if we look at the last chapter,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   we find that John knew.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   John knew what God was.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   But he chose not to follow.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Why do I say he knew?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Because if we look at the last chapter,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   let's say you listened to it last week.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Let's say you listened to it.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Did John know what God was?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Did he know?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Someone said they knew.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   You said you knew.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Let's zoom in.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   You said you knew.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Did John know what God was?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   He didn't know.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Maybe he thought it was good.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But if we look at the third chapter,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   the ninth chapter,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   what did John say?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   He said, "Who knows?"
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Everyone's English is better than mine.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   "Who knows?"
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "Who knows" is "知" or "唔知"?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   He didn't know.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   When they kneeled down,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   they didn't know.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   They were afraid of dying.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   But John knew.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   John knew what God was.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Let's read it again.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   "God who has grace and mercy,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   who does not easily go astray,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   who has a loving and loving heart,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   and who never regrets what he says."
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But you find that the "who knows"
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   is a very proper response.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   When we say we believe in Jesus,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   we have to repent.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So a person who doesn't know God
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   has a very proper response.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   They repent and say,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   "Maybe God will regret and not go astray."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   You see I'm highlighting this.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The author is clearly making a parallel.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   John knew what happened.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   But because he knew,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   he had to go astray.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So if you look at it from this perspective,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   even John's prayer...
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   We can learn a lot from John's prayer.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I can learn a lot from the content of his prayer.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   It's not that the prayer itself is a bad thing.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   But if we look at it from this perspective,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   even if the second chapter is a good prayer,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   a prayer that gives us a lot of reflection,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   it also says that I am right.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I am right in following you.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I know you.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Those people don't know you, but I know you.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I know you will save me.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   The "who knows" is very proper.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   In today's terms,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   the "who knows" is very proper.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   But you see the response.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   He is even worse than a little king who doesn't know God.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Who knows?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   He knows, but he chooses not to follow.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So why did Vietnam refuse to go?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   They were so unworthy of death.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   The reason is that only this chapter is seen.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   If we didn't have previous accounts or see the crime scene,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   we would have only realized that
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   they really wanted to see people die.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   They were happy to see people die.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It's not just about falling.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   What he is saying is that people died.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   If you remember what he said in the third chapter,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   if you go to the fourth chapter, your city will collapse.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Your people will all die.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   He said it to this extent.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So the real problem with Vietnam
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   is not that he doesn't know God.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The real problem with Vietnam is that he doesn't accept,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   he is not willing for God to use his
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   dislike and not-expecting way to do things.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   What does that mean?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   God sometimes gives you some humiliation,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   or gives you something you don't want.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   You think you don't want it at that moment.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You think, "What's wrong with that?"
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   "You said you would give me something good."
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I believe, not just me,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I believe everyone has a lot of experiences like this.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Why don't you give me a good half?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Why do you give me a breakup?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Of course, if God is willing to give you another half,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   you will be very happy.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   But a lot of people can't find it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So he asks, "Why don't you give me one?"
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "I know you are this kind of God. Why don't you give me one?"
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Luckily, this is what happened to Joanna.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   If God is really this bad,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   what would Joanna do?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   She would just use a thunderbolt to kill him.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And that would be the end of the story.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   But that's not what happened.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   We are very grateful that God is a God with compassion.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   So what?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   God wants him to know him more.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   How does he know him?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Through an action.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Let me ask you.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   This is the first four chapters.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   When Joanna complained to God,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   God knew she was this good, so he didn't follow her.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   God knew she wouldn't punish them.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   God asked her, "Is this right?"
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   She said, "No."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   But do you think Joanna would not be angry?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   What would she do?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   She would continue to be angry.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   What does the Bible say?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Some people are looking for the Bible.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   What does the Bible say?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   What did she do next?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Sorry?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   She would rather die, but she did one thing.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   She didn't leave this time.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   In the first chapter, she left after hearing God's words.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   She didn't leave this time.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   She didn't leave to take a boat.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   What did she do?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I forgot the script.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I don't know this part.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   What did she do?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   She went to the other side of the city.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   She sat down.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   What do you think she was doing?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   She didn't wait.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Let's look at the IG.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I appreciate the answer.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   What was she doing?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   She was sitting there.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   What happened?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   She was sitting there, waiting for her death.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   The Bible didn't say that.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   It said, "Let's see what happens in the city."
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   But if we read this, we know she was waiting for her death.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   It's actually very contradictory.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   You ask her,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   she knows very well what God is like.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   So God said that,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   and she didn't do it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   She knew it was over.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   She didn't have a choice.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   She sat there, waiting for her death.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   But she still had to wait.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   So she was angry.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I agree that she was angry.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   But at least she made some progress.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   She didn't just leave.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   She didn't just leave and ignore it.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   She had to see it.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Let's think about this.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   She was a prophet.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Even if we're not prophets,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   we feel that if someone believes in Jesus,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   we should be happy.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's normal to feel happy when your friend is in heaven.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Don't believe in Jesus.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   But she brought a whole city of people.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's not that she believed in God.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   But at least a whole city of people repented.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   She was really something.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   But she was still angry.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   She didn't like it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   But God didn't let her go.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   She was clearly sitting there,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   waiting for her death.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   But God didn't punish her directly.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What did God do?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   The Bible says that God gave her a plant.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I'm not familiar with plants.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I've never seen one.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Anyway, it's a plant.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   This plant is taller than the heat.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   What does that mean?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   It's a bit of geographical knowledge.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   For example,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   the location of Iran today.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   You know, those places are not like...
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   There are not many trees.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It's not a rainforest.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   In fact, the central area is full of deserts.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   There are a lot of mines.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   If you remember, the mine area...
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   The Israelis have been walking for 40 years.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   So those places have no responsibility.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   If you sit across from them,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   you'll be dead if you sit there and look.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   God gave her a plant.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It's taller than her head.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   It covers her.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Although we've seen this sentence before,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   this sentence has a little trick.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   The Bible says that this tree delivers her.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   It makes her less suffering.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   It helps her get out of the suffering.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   To put it simply,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   there are many words for suffering.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   In English, you can say pain,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   discomfort,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   or suffering.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   But in the author's dictionary,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   he deliberately uses the phrase
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   to refer to the sin of God saving the Lilliputians.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The Lilliputians are sinners.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The first chapter says they are sinners.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   It's the same word.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   What does it mean?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   God saved the Lilliputians from their sin.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   At least, that's what it means.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Although Vietnam didn't save them.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   If you don't repent, you'll be dead.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   But God saved the Lilliputians
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   from their sin.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   It's the same word.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   God saved the Lilliputians
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   from their discomfort.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   At least, they don't have to be burned.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It's the same word.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Of course, it's not that Vietnam is evil.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   That's not what it means.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   But there's a clear balance here.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   God saved the Lilliputians
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   from their suffering.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   He's willing to save those
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   who seem like bad people.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   He's willing to save those
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   who seem like bad people
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   from their sin.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Sin can make us suffer.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   We believe in that.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   If the story stops here,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   it's a happy ending.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   If the sin stops here, it's a happy ending.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   But does anyone remember
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   what happened next?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   The tree is here.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Was it dead or what?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   It wasn't dead.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It was dead.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   It was called dead and dried up.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   The tree was dead.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   It was a tree that was dead.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   You have a script.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Some people have a script.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I don't remember.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   What does the sin say?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   God turned the tree into a tree.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   The tree was forced to grow.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It's obvious that it wasn't planted.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   It was God who let it grow.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   What did God do the next day?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   He bit the tree with a worm.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   He bit it until it was dry.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Not only that,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   God also told him to make the place
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   (the wilderness)
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   to be sun-dried.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   What did the devil do?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   He planted a tree.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   He should be angry
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   because he's planting a tree.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   He said, "I'm going to die."
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   He's throwing a tantrum.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   He's always throwing a tantrum.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   He's throwing a tantrum since the first chapter.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   So what did the devil do?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   God asked him,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   "Why are you angry?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Are you angry at the tree?"
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   He's not angry at God.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   He's angry at the tree.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   What did the devil say?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   He said, "I'm angry to death.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   It's reasonable.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I deserve it."
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   I should be able to change my mind.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I deserve it.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   When you ask him if he knows
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   the tree was given to him by God,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   he might know.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   He did something for God.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   He should have this.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   He deserves this treatment.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   So God gave him a final lesson.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   In this book,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   we call it an open ending.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Because at this point,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   after God gave the final lesson,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   we don't know the answer.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   What lesson did he give?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   What did God say?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   God said, "This plant is not for you to plant.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   It's not for you to nurture."
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   It's not for you to nurture.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   It's not for you to grow up.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It's not for you to grow up.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   It's not for you to die.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It's for you to love.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It's compassion.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   It's for you to love.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   In the 11th chapter,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   "However, you are not yet mature.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   You cannot tell the difference
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   between the left and the right hand.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   There are more than 120,000 people
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and many of them are new.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   How can I not love?"
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   You will find that the 10th and 11th chapters
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   are all about this.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Let's talk about the first thing
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   that is easy to understand.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   John clearly knew
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   what kind of God he was.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   He memorized it correctly.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   In today's terms,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   he graduated from the Academy of God
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   with full marks.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   He memorized the verses of the Gospel,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   "There is compassion, there is love,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   there is not easy way, there is a way."
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   He had a good theology.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   He had a good theology.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It doesn't mean that he did a good thing.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   His problem was that
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   he found that God's work
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   was in contradiction with what he wanted.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Of course, we can see that
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   this is a translation that
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   is most commonly adopted.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It's like asking him
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   if he was willing to love people
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   just for himself.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I will talk about
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   how to understand this in the following section.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I said earlier that John had a good theology.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   John's problem was not
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   that he didn't know what God was like.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   He knew.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   You could say that he had full marks
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   for knowing things.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   But knowing doesn't mean that
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   he was willing to accept
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   what God said.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   He didn't like it.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   He didn't know that what God said was true.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Of course, we need to emphasize that
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   God didn't just love.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   If we just stop here,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   we will think that God loves everyone.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   But if we remember from the Bible,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Pastor Karen mentioned this
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   in his first sermon.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   People are always bad.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   So God did judge in the end.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Today, we are not reading the book of Nahuels.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You can go back and read it yourself.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   In the end, God still
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   judged this.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   God still has punishment.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Of course, you can say that
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   God repented.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But you can also imagine that
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   after someone repents, they will commit a crime again.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Or, after they repent, they deliberately commit a crime again.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Today, when we believe in Jesus,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   we will sometimes fall, sometimes get up.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   But if they repent,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   they deliberately do it,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   I don't believe it. I don't like it.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So God still judged in the end.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   So, apart from the question I asked,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   if we look at the structure of culture,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   to put it simply,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   it can be changed to another meaning,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   which is that I will not love this God anymore.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Of course,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   does that mean it's different? No.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Actually, the application is still the same.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   John's theology is not wrong.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   It's not that he doesn't recognize this God.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It's that he recognizes
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   his mistake.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   But he doesn't like
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   this God to do this.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   He doesn't like God
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   to use his time to work.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   After this, you can choose to use the first question.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Because there are indeed many
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   traditions or many scholars believe that.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I put two questions here.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   But I think both are the same application.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   We can be very familiar with this God.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   But at the end of the day,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   we don't like
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   to do His things
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   in His time.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   As I said, John
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   is a person who values
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   his freedom.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I think this is especially true
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   for our society today.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   We value our freedom.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I think it's not just an iPhone.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Actually, iPhone is also an "I".
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   We have a lot of things
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   that we want to show ourselves.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So even if I come back to church
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and recognize this God,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   what definition do I use for myself?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   For example, I am a pastor.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I am a pastor.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I am a leader.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   I am a junior.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I don't have many services.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   But as we grow up,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   we will define ourselves.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   We will slowly realize
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   that God is like this.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   We can memorize it.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I remember when I taught
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Avana two weeks ago,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I was very impressed by
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   a very short boy in the class.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Don't ask me who he is.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   But,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   it was a Bible Q&A competition.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   He was the most suitable one.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   He was the most suitable one.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   He even mentioned the names.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   I intentionally gave him some difficult ones.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Because the questions were too simple.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   He answered them well.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Then I asked him directly,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   "You know so many Bibles,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   but do you believe in Jesus?"
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   He told me,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   "Actually, I don't know if I believe in Jesus."
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   He knew all the stories
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   in the Bible.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   All the characters in the Bible.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   But he said, "Actually, I am not sure if I believe in Jesus."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   I hope I am not talking about you.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Sometimes, we don't like God
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   using a method we don't expect.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   We like God's timing.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   God's timing is good, we can say.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   But, after we have said all these,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   we still feel uncomfortable.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It is normal to feel uncomfortable.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   It is okay to struggle with God.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   But if I don't like what you are doing,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   I will not follow you.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   This is the problem.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Faith is not an intellectual exercise.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   If I can think it through,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I will believe in Jesus.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Just like Jonah, he could think through
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   what God was.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   But an intellectual exercise
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   will not help us
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   understand God.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   God wants us to have a personal relationship.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   He wants us to renew our relationship.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   He wants us to stop at what we like,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   what we are obsessed with.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Maybe that is my emotion.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Maybe some people are touched by the song.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Maybe some people like to make
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   philosophical arguments, and are happy.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Some people like to insist on the theory,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   and are happy.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   But in the end, God does not want us
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   to stick to these things.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   God wants us to really know Him.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I invite the team to sing
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   "Reconciliation" with us.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   "Reconciliation" has two lines.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   The first line is about us.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Today is the Pentecost.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   I think many of us have parents
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   who grew up in this church.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Some of them believe in Jesus.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   We are probably second generation Christians.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Maybe we have a lot of traditions
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   in our childhood.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   We have our religion.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   This is really a religion,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   but in the eyes of others.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   But as the conclusion says,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   God never expects us to be weak.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   God really wants us to know Him.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   He wants us to have compassion
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   not only for ourselves,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   but also for others,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   like God does.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I invite the team to sing "Reconciliation"
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   with us.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I invite the team to sing "Reconciliation" with us.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
