1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,040
 I had my daughter ask me this morning during breakfast, she said, "Daddy, what does the

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,280
 Holy Spirit do now?"

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,440
 It was like a great breakfast topic discussion, right?

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
 Put her on Alpha.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,520
 Yes, just feeling, thank you Florence just for leading us in worship, just feeling just

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,680
 grateful to be here, to be able to just worship together, really feeling that the Holy Spirit

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,640
 is the one that sustains us and drives and allows us to even worship Him, to even know

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
 Him.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,960
 So it's really good that we get to be here for that.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,600
 And we're going through Old Testament women.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,840
 Old Testament women and Johnny last week went through Rebecca and today I'm going to go

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,420
 through Leah and Rachel, or Rachel and Leah depending which way you want to put it.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,200
 Just to give you a little bit of context then.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,200
 So Rebecca, she has two boys and Johnny talked about this.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,280
 What are their names?

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,560
 Isa and Jacob.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,400
 Jacob the deceiver.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,640
 Jacob the one who tricks, steals the blessing.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,600
 And then eventually his mum says, "Okay, you've stolen the blessing, you've got what you want,

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 it's time to go."

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,280
 So he heads off.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,160
 He heads off across the land, finds his mother's brother, Uncle Laban, Laban, and then he goes

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,960
 to find Laban, and then before he meets Laban, he meets Laban's daughter, Rachel, who's a

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
 shepherdess who works for the family.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,840
 And he falls in love with Rachel because she's beautiful.

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,400
 And so he goes back, finds us, and they have this wonderful family reunion.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,000
 And then suddenly Laban says, "Hey, stay."

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,840
 And then Jacob says, "Yeah, I'll work for you."

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,200
 And then Laban's like, "Oh, I can't pay you nothing.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,160
 I've got to pay you something."

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,920
 And then that's when Jacob comes out with his big request.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,000
 "Let me marry your daughter.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,760
 Let me marry your beautiful daughter, and I will work for you for seven years."

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
 Seven years.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,120
 Just a little bit of context there.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,880
 There is such a thing as a dowry that is paid to parents when you marry their daughter,

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,480
 and usually that's about three or four months' worth of wage.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,240
 He's saying, "I'm going to give you seven years."

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,620
 So that's how much he loved Rachel.

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,320
 So then he works for Laban for seven years, but Scripture tells us this, and all of this

41
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,880
 is found in Genesis 29.

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
 So you can turn there if you want to.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,200
 I will be flying around a little bit within these few pages.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,640
 Genesis 29, let's go with 29 verse 20.

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,960
 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,760
 Can you imagine seven years feeling like a few days?

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
 And then time comes.

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,640
 He's like, "Laban, it's time for me to marry your daughter."

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,500
 And Laban's like, "Okay, you're right."

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,560
 So he organizes a feast, a party, everyone comes, they have a wonderful time, and then

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,300
 at nighttime, it's time for him to receive his bride.

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,060
 But Laban pulls a sneaky.

53
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,560
 Instead of giving him Rachel, the beautiful one whom Jacob loved, at nighttime when Jacob

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,840
 was probably a bit drunk by then, he gives him Leah.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
 Isn't that funny?

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
 Jacob the deceiver.

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,840
 Jacob who was the one who tricked to get his own blessing is now the one being tricked.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,840
 As you can see, deception runs through the family.

59
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,720
 So then he wakes up in the morning thinking he's just had the most wonderful night with

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,120
 the woman of his dreams, and he wakes up to find Leah.

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,520
 Now there's a difference here between the two, Rachel and Leah, and it's in chapter

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,080
 9, 29 verse 17.

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 Rachel was the younger one.

64
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,720
 Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,000
 Now there's some discussion as to what eyes were weak means, but most likely it didn't

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,720
 mean that she couldn't see very far.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,600
 Probably that she had some kind of eye disorder.

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,000
 Either way, she wasn't as beautiful as Rachel.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,080
 Rachel, on the other hand, was beautiful in form and appearance.

70
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,000
 So not only was she beautiful in terms of her face, but she was sexually attractive.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,360
 She had the right form as well.

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,800
 So Jacob is then absolutely distraught.

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,120
 He's been tricked.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,160
 So then he goes to Laban and goes, "What have you done to me?"

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,480
 And then Laban says, "Hey, actually, in our custom, you can't marry the younger one first.

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,060
 The older one has to go first.

77
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,320
 So actually, if you want Rachel, you can still have her work for me for another seven years,

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,380
 and next week I'll give you Rachel."

79
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,520
 And because of his love for Rachel, he says yes.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,160
 And he ends up marrying both of them.

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,360
 What a bad idea.

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
 What a bad idea.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
 Speaking to Ruben, he was asking me what I'm preaching on today.

84
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,960
 And I said, "Rachel and Leah."

85
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,240
 He said, "Oh, why does he have two wives?

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
 Why does he have more wives?"

87
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 I'm like, "You know what?

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
 I don't know.

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
 I don't know why anyone wants two wives.

90
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
 One is more than enough."

91
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:01,880
 In fact, God felt that it was such a bad idea to have two wives, both being sisters.

92
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,000
 In Leviticus 18, he tells these Israelites, "You will not marry sisters together."

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,440
 It was that bad an idea.

94
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,280
 And why was it a bad idea?

95
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,720
 What happens after they get married is this interesting journey in chapter 29 and chapter

96
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,840
 30 of them basically having a race for kids.

97
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,600
 You wonder where the wonderful holy nation, the 12 tribes of Israel come from.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,760
 They come from two sisters, basically trying to have as many kids as they could.

99
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,800
 12 kids in total.

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,520
 Leah starts the game off well, heads up 4-0.

101
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,760
 She has four at first.

102
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,680
 And then Rachel ends up catching up.

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,760
 Rachel ultimately ends up having two.

104
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
 But Rachel then has some sneaky ideas to get some as well.

105
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
 And ultimately, you end up with 12.

106
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,560
 And I'll tell you all about this story as we go through.

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,920
 But this is a story of two sisters basically competing against each other, knowing each

108
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
 other all of their lives.

109
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,400
 Who has siblings here?

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,640
 Have you competed with your siblings?

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,240
 Especially if one was more beautiful than the other.

112
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
 The fact that I didn't have that problem.

113
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:16,880
 I have a younger brother, but he was clearly the ugly one, so it was okay for me.

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,320
 He's actually not even here, so he can't even defend himself.

115
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
 But he really was.

116
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
 He really was.

117
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
 But anyway.

118
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
 Can you imagine just for a second being Leah?

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,060
 Being the older one and having this young little baby come into the family that steals

120
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,960
 all the attention.

121
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,840
 Then this young baby grows up into being the beautiful girl, whereas you're not as beautiful.

122
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,320
 Whereas you're considered to have weak eyes.

123
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,760
 All the aunties and uncles fawning over her, saying how beautiful she is.

124
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,520
 All the guys in school looking at her and not you.

125
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,320
 Eventually she is the one that gets picked.

126
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,720
 But then your dad on the very last night says, "You go first."

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,960
 Imagine the shame, the embarrassment.

128
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,120
 And then it doesn't stop there.

129
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,680
 Imagine waking up that morning thinking, "At least I'm married now."

130
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,280
 But then for the guy to go, "What?

131
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,640
 What are you doing here?"

132
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:31,640
 And then in chapter 29 verse 21, when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, which probably

133
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,880
 meant that she was neglected.

134
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,400
 So even though she was married and he took her in, he didn't give her any attention.

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:48,080
 Imagine that feeling of just being overlooked or ignored, neglected and hated.

136
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,280
 And then you look at Rachel, this beautiful girl growing up, no doubt.

137
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,680
 Got all the attention from all the uncles and aunties, from all the boys.

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,720
 Eventually gets the husband that's willing to work for 14 years for her.

139
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,480
 And then you see as the story goes on, Rachel is not that happy either.

140
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,040
 In fact, Rachel gets to a point where she doesn't get to have kids at the beginning.

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:20,240
 She's barren at the beginning where she says in chapter 30 verse 1, she's angry at Jacob

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,280
 because Leah's 4-0 up.

143
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,080
 And she said, "Why aren't you giving me kids?"

144
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,880
 And Jacob's like, "It's not my fault.

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,800
 I'm doing the same thing.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
 And kids are happening over here.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So it's something between you and God."

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,080
 And then she says, "Give me children or I shall die."

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,080
 This is Rachel, the one who had all the attention, who had all the love from the husband, who

150
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
 had all the looks.

151
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,120
 And yet she was at a point where she said, "Give me children or I will die."

152
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,720
 You look at these two sisters, you look at their story and you wonder, what on earth

153
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,800
 happened?

154
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
 How did it get so bad?

155
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,680
 How did it get to the point where this whole family has been consumed by this issue?

156
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,200
 And what is this issue?

157
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,880
 What is the issue that plagued this whole family, all these two sisters?

158
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,760
 I think it's in chapter 30 verse 1, envy.

159
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,600
 Scripture says that Rachel envied Leah because she had kids and she didn't.

160
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:31,080
 One of the deadly sins, the desire to possess something that others have, envy.

161
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,280
 But it's actually even worse than that.

162
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,360
 It's not just wanting what they have.

163
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,600
 There's a negative feeling.

164
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,520
 It's if I can't have it, they can't either.

165
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,280
 That's envy.

166
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,840
 Scripture describes it as being intensely red.

167
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,080
 It's this idea of just seeing what other people have, being completely discontent, resenting

168
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,640
 it.

169
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,040
 And envy is everywhere.

170
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,100
 It's funny, last time I preached here, I talked about money, sex, and power.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
 And today I'm talking about envy.

172
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,840
 So I'm coming out with all the really positive, feel-good topics here.

173
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
 But it's everywhere.

174
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:12,840
 Money, sex, and power are a problem because of envy.

175
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,400
 Because we're looking at other people going, "Oh, look how much money they have.

176
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 Look.

177
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
 Oh, they have this kind of house.

178
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
 Oh, they have this kind of wife.

179
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,320
 This have this kind of life.

180
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,600
 They have this kind of yacht."

181
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,680
 And then you wonder, that's where people are chasing after money.

182
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
 Same with sex.

183
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,340
 Same with power.

184
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,280
 Envy is that deadly.

185
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,800
 Envy is that dangerous.

186
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,280
 And I wanted to focus basically on this topic today.

187
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,140
 This topic of envy.

188
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,480
 And it's an interesting one, but there's really two questions I want to ask, and they're these.

189
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,460
 How does it start and how can it end?

190
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,600
 How does it start and how can it end?

191
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
 We clearly see, we clearly know that envy is a problem, but how does it start and how

192
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
 can it end?

193
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 And I'm going to focus on these by looking at the story of Rachel and Leah.

194
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,800
 Let's start with how does it start.

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,560
 I think it starts basically with four things.

196
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,880
 And there are four components that basically drive this vicious cycle of envy.

197
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 They are comparison, discontentment, resentment, and manipulation.

198
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
 Let's start with the first one, comparison.

199
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,200
 Did you know that kids, when they turn seven years old, is when they first start to notice

200
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,480
 other people are different to them.

201
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,960
 Up until then, their ignorance is bliss.

202
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,920
 They're getting on with their own thing.

203
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,960
 But at seven years old, researchers believe that's when they start looking at other kids

204
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,840
 in school and going, why does he have a phone?

205
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,560
 Why do I not?

206
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
 Oh.

207
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,160
 I got this question asked to me.

208
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,080
 Daddy, why doesn't our car door open like this?

209
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,120
 I was like, why would you want that?

210
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,800
 Our mode of transportation opens like this.

211
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,160
 It's pretty much the same.

212
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,720
 But it's around that age they start to compare.

213
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,120
 They start to look and go, hmm, what's going on here?

214
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,800
 And that's exactly what happened with Rachel and Leah.

215
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,080
 You see, Leah no doubt would have been compared to Rachel.

216
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,160
 Rachel was comparing herself to Leah.

217
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,740
 And you see, this is where the problem begins.

218
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,440
 This is where the seed of envy is planted.

219
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,720
 When you look across at someone else and go, hmm, how do I compare to them?

220
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,880
 Do you do that?

221
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
 Did you do that with your siblings growing up?

222
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,720
 Did you do that with your school friends?

223
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,000
 Did you go to that kind of school where everyone's -- why do parents sign up to -- sign their

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,920
 kids up, their babies up to kindergarten before they're even born?

225
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
 It starts with comparison.

226
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 Looking at, oh, that's what they do.

227
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
 That's what they do.

228
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,580
 Oh, that's -- that's how it begins.

229
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,720
 Comparison is the beginning of envy.

230
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,960
 And you can see here that Leah is looking at Rachel going, why does she get all the

231
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
 attention?

232
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,700
 Why is she the one who's loved?

233
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,200
 Why am I the one who's hated?

234
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,480
 And then you've got Rachel, who's beautiful, who has a husband, but she doesn't have kids.

235
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,600
 And back in those days, to have kids for a woman is the most important thing.

236
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,880
 And so she is at the point where she's like, I need kids or otherwise there's no point

237
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,440
 in living anymore.

238
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,120
 Comparison is the beginning of envy.

239
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,960
 And I want to tell you another story that really highlights this.

240
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,320
 It's in 1 Samuel 18.

241
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,760
 And we've all heard about David and Goliath.

242
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,120
 David, this little boy, the shepherd, defeats this huge giant.

243
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,240
 And then Saul, of course, welcomes him in.

244
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
 And then it gets to the point where they conquer other nations.

245
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,840
 And as they're heading home, something fascinating happens.

246
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,240
 And I want to take you to turn, if you can, to 1 Samuel 18.

247
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,160
 So they've just defeated Goliath, they've defeated some other people, and they're on

248
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
 their way home.

249
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,640
 And as they are heading home, they're heading home back to their city.

250
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:04,400
 They are met with singing and dancing, tambourines, songs of joy with musicians.

251
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,600
 And the women sang to one another.

252
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
 And what did they sing?

253
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,600
 They sang this interesting line.

254
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 And it was this.

255
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,440
 "Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands."

256
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,120
 Actually, it was just an innocent song.

257
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
 It was poetry.

258
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,200
 Because, of course, David didn't kill ten thousands compared to Saul's thousands.

259
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,480
 It was just a way of singing.

260
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,720
 But Saul then got very angry.

261
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,040
 And this saying displeased him.

262
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,400
 He said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me only thousands.

263
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,440
 What more can he have but the kingdom?"

264
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,880
 And here's the verse.

265
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,320
 1 Samuel 18, verse 9.

266
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,560
 "And Saul eyed David from that day on."

267
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,320
 Envy began through comparison.

268
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,200
 And I want us to reflect on this.

269
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,480
 Do we compare ourselves to other people?

270
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,280
 Do we measure ourselves, our worth, to what other people are doing?

271
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,600
 Comparison is the beginning.

272
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,320
 Other comparison, of course, then leads to discontentment.

273
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 Because why?

274
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,680
 You're looking at other people and looking at what they do.

275
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,920
 And social media is the best.

276
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,800
 I'm sure I've said this before as well.

277
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,960
 You scroll through social media.

278
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
 Actually, I've recently felt this.

279
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,480
 So I took time off social media for Lent.

280
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,760
 And then when I went back, I realized I was starting to feel FOMO.

281
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
 What's FOMO?

282
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
 Do you know?

283
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
 Fear of missing out.

284
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
 I was lucky.

285
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,240
 I was like, "Oh, they're going here.

286
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,160
 Oh, they're hanging out.

287
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,800
 Oh, they're at this beach.

288
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,080
 Oh, they're sipping cocktails at this beach."

289
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,520
 Inadvertently, I'm comparing my life to theirs.

290
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,480
 Because whilst I'm looking at their Instagram story of being on a beach, what am I doing?

291
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,360
 I'm on the toilet.

292
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,080
 I'm comparing my life to theirs.

293
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,760
 And it's not a great place where I am, but it looks like it's a very nice place where

294
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,600
 they are.

295
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,520
 And then if you're not careful, that comparison leads to discontent.

296
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,040
 It leads to you not being happy about anything that you have.

297
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,600
 You see, the problem with envy is this.

298
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,160
 It's a thief.

299
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,080
 It robs you of joy.

300
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,640
 I want to fast forward in Genesis now where Rachel finally has kids.

301
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,120
 She has -- okay.

302
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,240
 Leah is 4-0 up.

303
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,200
 You're keeping track.

304
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,160
 Rachel gets very upset.

305
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,720
 How's it go at Jacob?

306
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,840
 Jacob's like, "Nothing I can do."

307
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,200
 Rachel then takes matters into her own hands and says, "Okay.

308
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,680
 In that case, I'll give you my servant.

309
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,320
 And if she has babies, they can be on behalf of me."

310
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,040
 So then she actually has two through the servant.

311
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,240
 Leah sees it and goes, "Oh, then I'll do it as well."

312
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,760
 So then she gives her Jacob his -- like, "Jacob, what is he doing?"

313
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,600
 Anyway, so -- and then gets the servant and then has another two.

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,600
 Finally, finally, finally, at the very end, Rachel does have a kid.

315
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
 What's his name?

316
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,880
 Joseph.

317
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,200
 Number 11.

318
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,400
 And you think at that moment, that will be it.

319
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,800
 Oh, finally, the Lord has answered my prayer.

320
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,720
 I am satisfied.

321
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,760
 I am happy.

322
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,000
 I have what I need.

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,200
 She doesn't.

324
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,520
 What does she say at the end of chapter 30?

325
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,320
 "Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb.

326
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,320
 She conceived and bore a son and said, 'God has taken away my reproach.'

327
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,120
 And she called his name Joseph, saying, 'May the Lord add to me another son.'"

328
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,720
 So even though she finally got her son, what was the first thing on her mind?

329
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,840
 "I need another one."

330
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,720
 Discontent.

331
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,320
 Envy leads to discontent.

332
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,360
 It is a thief.

333
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,200
 It steals joy from you.

334
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,760
 It robs you of your relationships.

335
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,200
 It robs you of your healthy marriages because you're looking -- you're always looking at someone else.

336
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,120
 You're always trying to find something that's better than what you have.

337
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,320
 The grass, apparently, is always greener.

338
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,400
 And what does that mean?

339
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,920
 That means you're never happy with your piece of grass.

340
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,000
 And Scripture tells us this.

341
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,400
 Paul talks to Timothy and says, "Godliness starts with being content."

342
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,400
 Starts with being happy with what God's given you.

343
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,800
 Because what are you doing when you are discontent?

344
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,720
 You're saying, "God, you don't really love me.

345
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,520
 You don't know what I need.

346
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,000
 And I don't really trust you because I'm not happy with what you've given me."

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,920
 That's what discontent is, right?

348
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,400
 And that is directly opposed to godliness.

349
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,120
 So comparison and then discontent.

350
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,200
 And you see, it all ends up being chasing after the wind.

351
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,480
 Rachel had the love of a husband but wanted kids.

352
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,760
 Leah didn't have the love of a husband but really wanted it.

353
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,960
 You can see the first few kids she has.

354
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,560
 Reuben, Simeon and Levi.

355
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,240
 What does she call them when she has them?

356
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,480
 This is the end of 29.

357
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,360
 When she has Reuben, she says, "Ah, because the Lord has looked upon my affliction,

358
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,440
 for now my husband will love me."

359
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
 "For now my husband will love me.

360
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,160
 Now that I've got him his first son, now my husband will love me."

361
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,040
 So even though she got this gift, she's still saying, "Oh, now I have this baby.

362
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,840
 Maybe now Jacob will give me some attention.

363
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,280
 Maybe now he'll love me like he loves Rachel."

364
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,560
 That's what she felt when she had her first baby.

365
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
 And then she had her second one.

366
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
 And she says, "Oh, the Lord has heard that I'm hated.

367
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,440
 And now this time my husband will be attached to me."

368
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,760
 So time and time again, first baby, Reuben.

369
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,120
 Second baby, Simeon.

370
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,040
 Third baby, Levi.

371
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,440
 Every time she's saying, "Thank God for this.

372
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
 He's listened to me.

373
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,800
 Now Jacob will love me."

374
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,120
 Can you feel that hurt in Leah?

375
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
 That that's what she felt?

376
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,800
 That having the kid was all still about chasing after her husband's affections?

377
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,600
 You see, the problem is, Rachel and Leah really both had the same problem,

378
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,320
 which is that they were both placing all their hopes on this one man.

379
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,000
 They were both trying to get satisfaction and validation from this one person.

380
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,040
 But the problem is, you always are left disappointed.

381
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,280
 You always are left disappointed.

382
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,960
 What you thought was going to be good for you, it doesn't deliver.

383
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,000
 Tim Keller has this slightly honest and brash way of maybe putting this.

384
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,960
 And of course, we appreciate who Rachel and Leah are.

385
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,160
 And he says, "What you think you've got, what you think you have,

386
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,440
 you go to bed with Rachel, you wake up the next morning and it's Leah.

387
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,000
 What you thought would be very good for you, those friends, that job,

388
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,360
 that car, that yacht, you think you're going to bed with Rachel at night

389
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,160
 because you're fully satisfied now, but you wake up and it's Leah.

390
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,080
 You wake up and you realise it wasn't what you thought it would be."

391
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,320
 Discontent is all a chasing after the wind.

392
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,600
 Anything of this world, if you are putting your hope in it,

393
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,400
 if you are trying to earn your security in it, it will disappoint you.

394
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,520
 That's what envy does.

395
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,160
 That's why God thought it was so serious that he would make it a commandment.

396
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,320
 Do not covet.

397
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,440
 What is he saying?

398
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,040
 He's saying, "Don't do it."

399
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,720
 Not because it's not fun, not because it's not a pleasurable experience.

400
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,440
 He's saying, "If you do it, it will rob you of joy.

401
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
 It will rob you of peace."

402
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,520
 Charles Swindoll was the one who said, "Envy is the great enemy of peace."

403
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,840
 Do you have peace?

404
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,640
 Do you have inner peace?

405
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,440
 And if you don't, at least it's worth the question.

406
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,160
 Is there envy in your heart?

407
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,080
 Are you comparing your situation to those around you?

408
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:04,160
 And this city is just incredible for that.

409
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,760
 Do you have peace?

410
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,080
 If you don't, is it because there is envy in your heart?

411
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,000
 Are you comparing?

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,920
 Are you discontent?

413
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,840
 See, what happens with this is you're discontent.

414
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,400
 But then it leads to resentment.

415
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,560
 Now, resentment is an even more negative one, you could say.

416
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,600
 In the middle of chapter 30, in verse 14, it says this,

417
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,400
 "In the days of wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field

418
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,480
 and brought them to his mother, Leah.

419
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,880
 Then Rachel said, 'Hey, please give me some of your son's mandrakes.'

420
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,040
 Reuben brought them in, this plant, 'Can your son give me some of them?'"

421
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,440
 And what does Leah say?

422
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,200
 She says, "You've taken my husband and now you want my mandrakes?"

423
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,880
 A little bit of an overreaction, but you can see the resentment.

424
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,840
 You can see the resentment that would have no doubt built up

425
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,800
 all the way from the moment Rachel was born.

426
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,120
 And then, of course, the resentment that Rachel has

427
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,720
 when she asks for children, otherwise she would die.

428
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,080
 You see, resentment is, again, that same thing.

429
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,120
 If I can't have it, neither can they.

430
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,920
 Researchers say that 80% of criticisms find their root in envy.

431
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,400
 So when people are criticizing other people,

432
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,440
 a lot of it is really rooted in envy.

433
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,440
 There's a National Health Institute of Japan, they did a study on envy,

434
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,440
 and they found this, they found it was really interesting.

435
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,280
 They studied the brain, and they studied the pain nodules

436
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,240
 that existed in the brain, and they found that

437
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,680
 when someone is experiencing envy, the same pain nodules

438
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,080
 as when you are suffering from physical pain are activated.

439
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,360
 Isn't that crazy?

440
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,960
 But when you're facing a physical pain, because someone's maybe punching you

441
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,200
 or whatever it is, or you get a paper cut,

442
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,960
 the same part of your brain is activated as when you're feeling envy.

443
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,320
 So you associate it with pain.

444
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
 What's even more interesting is this.

445
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,760
 When the participants were shown an image of someone that they envied

446
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:25,040
 going through suffering, which part of the brain was activated?

447
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,280
 The pleasure centers.

448
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,680
 When they saw someone that they envied going through suffering,

449
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,680
 their pleasure centers woke up.

450
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,120
 They felt pleasure from it.

451
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,480
 Isn't that terrifying?

452
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
 Isn't that why we read, I mean I personally don't,

453
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,720
 why we read news websites like TNZ and any gossip places?

454
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,360
 When we're looking at other people that we might actually envy,

455
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
 and we see them screw up and mess up their lives,

456
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,920
 it brings us pleasure.

457
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,360
 That's envy, brothers and sisters.

458
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,080
 That's us comparing.

459
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,360
 That's us not being content.

460
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
 That's us being resentful.

461
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,560
 Envy is that dangerous.

462
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,800
 And it doesn't stop there, because you see the problem is this.

463
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,880
 A problem that starts with envy never ends with just envy.

464
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
 It doesn't just stay there.

465
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,800
 Now it's dangerous because it's hidden.

466
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,880
 When you're envying someone, it's all hidden.

467
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
 You don't see it appear physically.

468
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
 But it's dangerous.

469
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,800
 It's hidden in that sense.

470
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,960
 But then what starts with envy never ends with envy,

471
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,800
 because it often leads to something else.

472
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,080
 Look at the very first human that was ever born, Cain.

473
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,480
 What led him to be a murderer?

474
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,800
 Envy.

475
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 You see, the problem is this.

476
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,880
 We start with comparison, then we move to discontentment,

477
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,800
 then we move to resentment, and finally we move to manipulation.

478
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,680
 Now I was trying to figure out what word to use here,

479
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,080
 because it's kind of manipulation.

480
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,880
 I kind of wanted to use the word action,

481
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,200
 but it's more than that.

482
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
 So I ended up with manipulation, because it's this.

483
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,760
 When you envy, when you compare yourself,

484
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
 when you don't trust God,

485
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,160
 when you're not happy with what God's given you,

486
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,200
 what do you do?

487
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
 You take matters into your own hands.

488
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
 You manipulate the situation.

489
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,560
 So what happened with Rachel?

490
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,800
 She saw that she couldn't have kids.

491
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,120
 So then she gives her servant to have kids.

492
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,320
 And then when the servant had kids,

493
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,800
 she still wasn't happy enough.

494
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,600
 And that's where the story about the mandrakes comes back in.

495
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,640
 She sees Reuben, Leah's son,

496
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,200
 come back with these mandrakes, which is a plant.

497
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
 But what kind of plant?

498
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,000
 It's a fertility plant.

499
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,560
 They believe that if you ate these mandrakes,

500
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,120
 you would have kids.

501
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,080
 So she's taking matters into her own hands.

502
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
 It's an interesting fact, right?

503
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,520
 Or another interesting fact,

504
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,200
 Leah and Rachel actually means cow and ewe,

505
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,680
 like baby sheep, E-W-E.

506
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,280
 What kind of man would call their daughter cow?

507
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,880
 Anyway, apparently herdsmen families would do that.

508
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,280
 They would name their children after whatever, anyway.

509
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,520
 These mandrakes were basically a fertility plant.

510
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,400
 So Rachel's saying, "If only I could eat this plant.

511
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,240
 If only I could have this, this could give me babies."

512
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,360
 And yet what happens?

513
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,320
 Leah's like, "What?

514
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,120
 You took my husband and now you want my plants?"

515
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,720
 And then Rachel says, "Okay, fine.

516
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,000
 Give me your plants and I'll give you Jacob for one night."

517
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,840
 That was a deal.

518
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,520
 And then they're like, "Deal."

519
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,960
 And so Jacob comes home from work

520
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,080
 and Rachel go, "Oh, you're with her tonight."

521
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
 And he's like, "Oh, okay, I'm with her."

522
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,120
 Doesn't paint a good picture for men, does it really?

523
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
 And what happens?

524
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,200
 Even though she got the mandrakes,

525
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,840
 who ended up having the next two boys?

526
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,680
 Leah.

527
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,200
 So she tried to manipulate the situation,

528
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,120
 tried to use her servants, tried to get the mandrakes,

529
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,800
 yet still Leah was the one that had the babies.

530
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,400
 Manipulation, us taking matters into our own hands.

531
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
 Can you think of a time recently

532
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,360
 where maybe you took matters into your own hands?

533
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,160
 Whether it's in your personal life, family,

534
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,520
 romantic life, professional life,

535
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,200
 where you decided, "You know what?

536
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,160
 I know God promised me.

537
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,800
 I know there's that song, 'He's Sovereign'

538
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,640
 and his plans to make us prosper are still there,

539
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,080
 but I'm just gonna do it myself."

540
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,360
 Have you had that?

541
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,280
 'Cause if you have, retrace your steps.

542
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,400
 Was there resentment?

543
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,440
 Was there discontent?

544
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
 Was there comparison?

545
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,240
 Was there envy?

546
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,120
 Because envy, brothers and sisters, is dangerous.

547
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,040
 As a really interesting quote,

548
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,640
 "Envy is the daughter of pride,

549
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,600
 the author of murder and revenge,

550
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,360
 the begetter of secret sedition,

551
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,920
 the perpetual tormentor of virtue."

552
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,680
 What starts with envy rarely ends with envy.

553
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,640
 And it's something that we need to address.

554
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,520
 It's something that we really need to get to the root of.

555
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,920
 It's important because otherwise,

556
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,320
 it's this never-ending cycle.

557
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
 Whatever you're doing right now,

558
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,440
 you're just chasing these things.

559
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,400
 It's just constantly chasing after something

560
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,840
 that will never satisfy you.

561
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,120
 You'll always be asking for more.

562
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,080
 Another interesting quote is this,

563
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,040
 "A man will do many things to get loved,

564
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,600
 but he will do all things to get himself envied."

565
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,400
 See, the problem about social media is,

566
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,440
 and I love social media,

567
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,480
 there's great things that happen with it,

568
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,640
 so I'm not here just to slander social media,

569
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,800
 is yes, it contributes to this perpetual cycle of envy.

570
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,400
 'Cause if we think back to ourselves,

571
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,200
 I mean, we're looking at other people's nice stuff,

572
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,760
 but we're also posting our own nice stuff, right?

573
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,360
 We're also trying to put our best foot forward.

574
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,600
 What are we trying to do?

575
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,040
 Whilst we're envying others,

576
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,120
 we're also wanting others to envy us.

577
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,440
 And that's how this cycle is fed,

578
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,720
 because we're always wanting to be validated.

579
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,360
 We're always wanting to be looked up to.

580
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,040
 We're always wanting to be liked.

581
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,240
 We're always wanting to be envied.

582
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,520
 And that's a matter of the heart that is deep.

583
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,600
 That's a matter that we need to search ourselves and ask,

584
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,560
 God, is there any offensive way in me?

585
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
 Is there any offensive way in me?

586
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,000
 Do I envy in any way?

587
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,080
 'Cause I see how dangerous it could be.

588
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,560
 Now, you may not be so envious to the point

589
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,880
 where you're gonna be going out to kill someone,

590
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,800
 but you can see the steps that it takes you down.

591
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,240
 It's important for us to ask the question then,

592
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,720
 how can it end?

593
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,520
 We know how it starts, but how can it end?

594
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,280
 And of course, it's not really a cop-out,

595
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,760
 but I guess it kind of is.

596
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,640
 The answer, of course,

597
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,520
 is that we can't put an end to it ourselves.

598
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,000
 It all comes back to God.

599
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Envy may start with us, but it has to end with God.

600
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,120
 It has to.

601
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,040
 It has to have us putting our eyes back onto him.

602
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,400
 And we see that in the story of Rachel and Leah,

603
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,800
 because to battle the comparison, the discontentment,

604
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,920
 the resentment and the manipulation,

605
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,120
 we see that through this journey, this very flawed journey,

606
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,960
 this is God using imperfect people

607
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
 to carry out his perfect plan.

608
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,560
 Did you know that this is how the 12 tribes of Israel

609
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,640
 was formed?

610
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,400
 Because these two ladies, these two sisters,

611
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,720
 were having a baby battle.

612
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,440
 And yet these end up being the 12 tribes of Israel.

613
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,520
 And then we see here is that

614
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,680
 even though all this stuff was happening,

615
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,920
 even though it was plagued with envy,

616
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,320
 God is always still there.

617
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,680
 God is always still present, because 29 verse 31,

618
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,200
 "When the Lord saw that Leah was hated."

619
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,920
 In order to fight the comparison,

620
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,720
 we need to remember that God sees.

621
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
 God sees you.

622
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,960
 You might feel like Leah, you might feel overlooked.

623
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,760
 You might feel neglected.

624
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,680
 You might feel that everyone is constantly

625
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,640
 looking somewhere else,

626
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,520
 but here's what scripture is telling you.

627
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,000
 Here's what this story is telling you, that God sees you.

628
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,640
 Leah, no doubt, had to battle this

629
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,520
 from the beginning of her life.

630
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,680
 Maybe you have too.

631
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,760
 But I feel it's important for me to tell you

632
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,800
 that God sees you.

633
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,160
 He knows you and he loves you.

634
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,520
 So there is no need for you to compare.

635
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,400
 He's not looking at you and so-and-so.

636
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,360
 He's not comparing you to so-and-so.

637
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,400
 He sees you for who you are.

638
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,360
 And you were fearfully and wonderfully made by him.

639
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,400
 So there is no need to compare.

640
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600
 Stay in your lane.

641
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,760
 Stay and be who God has called you to be

642
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,520
 because his eyes are on you.

643
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,400
 He sees you.

644
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,120
 Fast forward to the end, towards the end of chapter 30,

645
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,800
 well, verse 22, you see three things that God finally does.

646
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,200
 Chapter 30, verse 22 says this,

647
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,240
 "Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her

648
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,000
 "and he opened her womb and he gives her a baby."

649
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,280
 So the second one is this,

650
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,080
 not only does he see, he remembers.

651
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,840
 Now, remember isn't like, oh, God forgot about you.

652
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,360
 Oh, oh, oh, sorry, Leah, you're there.

653
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,240
 Oh, oh, Rachel, I didn't realise you existed.

654
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,480
 No, it's not that.

655
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,240
 What the Bible means when it says remember,

656
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,120
 it means he cares for you.

657
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,800
 He shows concern for you.

658
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,400
 He knows what's best for you

659
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,240
 and he is keen to provide what you need.

660
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,640
 So you don't need to have any discontentment in your heart.

661
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,040
 You don't need to feel as though you don't have enough

662
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,600
 because you do, that song we sang,

663
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,800
 all we have is Christ and that is really enough.

664
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,880
 God remembers you.

665
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,080
 God knows your plight.

666
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,320
 He knows the struggles.

667
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,840
 He knows all these things,

668
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,360
 but he sees you and he remembers you.

669
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,120
 So don't compare and be content.

670
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,480
 In who you are and what he's given you

671
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,240
 and who he's made you to be.

672
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,600
 And not only does he see you and remember you,

673
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,560
 he listens to you.

674
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,960
 He answers prayer.

675
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,440
 He desires connection.

676
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,040
 He wants you to talk to him about these things.

677
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,880
 He wants you to share your life with him

678
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,280
 because he sees you, he remembers you,

679
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,840
 and he listens to you.

680
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,200
 And he is never late and he is never insufficient.

681
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,880
 His grace is always sufficient for you.

682
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,400
 Peter says, "Those who think the Lord is being slow,

683
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
 "he's not, because to him, a thousand years is like a day

684
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,720
 "and a day is like a thousand years."

685
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,600
 But he knows what's best for you.

686
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,080
 So stay the course, keep in step with him.

687
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,000
 Don't rush ahead, but just trust him.

688
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,880
 Trust him that his timing is right,

689
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,160
 that he is always on time.

690
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,280
 And finally, he opens up a room.

691
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,320
 He is the one who gives,

692
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,680
 regardless of what Rachel and Leah do.

693
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,280
 He is the one that gives the kids.

694
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,520
 Isn't it interesting that God promises Abraham

695
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,040
 that he will be a father of nations.

696
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,040
 Yet even in that family, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

697
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,960
 there is the issue of fertility.

698
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
 Isn't that ironic, almost?

699
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,720
 But it's almost like God saying,

700
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,280
 "I've given you this promise,

701
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,600
 "but you need to stay close to me.

702
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,600
 "No mandrakes, no eating of vegetables will get you babies.

703
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:14,400
 "Trust me, I see you, I remember you, I'm listening to you,

704
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,200
 "and I will give as I see fit."

705
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,560
 It is the Lord who always gives.

706
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,800
 And of course, we're talking about babysitting,

707
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,920
 but we can apply that to any situation that we have.

708
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,600
 Whatever you feel as though you're waiting for,

709
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,520
 whatever you feel as though you need to manipulate for,

710
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,080
 that you need to take matters into your own hands for.

711
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,880
 God's saying, "Let go.

712
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,640
 "If you truly knew who I was,

713
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,920
 "you would know that I know what you need."

714
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,840
 Matthew 7 talks about that, right?

715
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,240
 "Ask and you shall receive."

716
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,080
 Why?

717
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,320
 Because if an earthly father knows what good gifts to give,

718
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,080
 God, of course, knows what you need.

719
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,040
 So trust him.

720
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,520
 So trust him.

721
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,920
 But you may ask, "Hmm, sounds good,

722
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
 "but why should I trust him?

723
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,320
 "Is he really gonna give me what I need?"

724
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,360
 You see, I think God is patient,

725
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,800
 and he teaches us in his own time.

726
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,200
 And I think Leah was starting to get the idea.

727
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,360
 I told you about the three kids

728
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,920
 that she had at the beginning.

729
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,240
 And each time she named them and then said,

730
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,000
 "Maybe my husband will love me now."

731
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,160
 By the fourth kid, something interesting happens.

732
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,840
 By the fourth kid, she names him Judah.

733
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:40,800
 But she says, "This time, I will praise the Lord."

734
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,200
 Can you see the change in her heart?

735
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,480
 The first three times, she's like,

736
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,520
 "Oh, if I have this kid, if I do what I can,

737
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,360
 "my husband will love me,

738
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,760
 "I'll get all the satisfaction I need

739
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,240
 "and all the safety I need."

740
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,160
 But no, she didn't get it until the fourth kid.

741
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,280
 And the fourth kid, Judah, she says,

742
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,840
 "This time, I think I get it.

743
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,760
 "This time, I will praise the Lord."

744
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,000
 And what happens after that?

745
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,600
 The 12 tribes of Israel, of course,

746
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,400
 ends up carrying on, carrying on

747
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,640
 to being the person of Jesus.

748
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,520
 Jesus Christ himself, the Messiah,

749
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,720
 comes from this tribe, this mess.

750
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
 And who does he come from?

751
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,560
 Judah.

752
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,560
 He doesn't come through Rachel, the most loved wife,

753
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,080
 the most beautiful wife.

754
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,280
 Doesn't come through Joseph,

755
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,040
 who he ends up using for mighty things.

756
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,160
 He comes through Leah and Judah.

757
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,960
 Isn't that fascinating?

758
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,760
 Do you realise that we all sit here,

759
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,240
 saved because of what Jesus did,

760
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,160
 because Jacob slept with Leah?

761
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,920
 Not Rachel, Leah.

762
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,080
 Can you see how God used imperfect people,

763
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,880
 filled with envy, comparison, discontentment,

764
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,680
 resentment and manipulation,

765
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,760
 but ended up bringing about a saviour

766
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,600
 through their mistakes.

767
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,840
 That through the line of Judah,

768
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,320
 son of Leah, the unloved and hated and ugly Leah,

769
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,800
 Jesus himself, deeply despised, rejected,

770
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,240
 yet ends up saving mankind.

771
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,920
 Can we just ponder on that for a moment,

772
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,880
 that God would use such a plan to rescue us?

773
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,840
 I wanna finish with this one final story.

774
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,160
 I talked about David and Goliath,

775
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,760
 and I feel as though this gives us a real answer to envy.

776
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,200
 A practical one that we can kind of hold on to.

777
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,840
 See, whilst he beats Goliath, he comes home,

778
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,520
 the ladies sing this song that basically gets into trouble,

779
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,560
 and then Saul ends up chasing him and trying to kill him.

780
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,360
 In the middle of that, or just before that,

781
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,480
 in the beginning of chapter 18,

782
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,840
 it talks about David and Jonathan's friend.

783
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,160
 Who's Jonathan?

784
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,960
 Jonathan is Saul's son.

785
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,560
 And what happens is David beats Goliath,

786
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,400
 is introduced to the royal family,

787
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,080
 and ends up striking up a friendship with Jonathan.

788
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,480
 But then Jonathan's dad, Saul, starts to get envious,

789
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,840
 starts to chase down his son's friend, David.

790
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,440
 But scripture says something fascinating here,

791
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,560
 which he says, "But then Jonathan made a covenant

792
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,040
 "with David because he loved him as his own soul."

793
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,840
 And I think this is the remedy to envy, love.

794
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,960
 Because what happens here?

795
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,560
 Can you imagine Saul is envying David?

796
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,320
 It would make a lot of sense

797
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,280
 if Jonathan was envying David as well, right?

798
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,720
 'Cause this is the guy, Jonathan's supposed to be king soon

799
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,520
 whenever his dad kicks the bucket.

800
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,240
 But now you've got this guy, this David,

801
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,680
 who could take your throne.

802
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,080
 Jonathan should, by worldly standards, be envying David,

803
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,000
 completely trying to trample over him, destroying him.

804
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,640
 Yet scripture tells us here, he loves him as his own soul.

805
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,120
 And then here's the next verse.

806
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,920
 "And Jonathan strips himself of the robe that was on him

807
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,360
 "and gave it to David."

808
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,920
 So he sees this young man brought in,

809
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,960
 defeating this Philistine for his father.

810
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,200
 He should be nervous.

811
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,960
 He should be like, "Oh, who is this guy?

812
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,400
 "Is he gonna take my place as king?"

813
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,240
 But instead, when he sees David,

814
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,840
 when he builds up this friendship with him,

815
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,640
 he takes off his robe and covers David,

816
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,880
 showing no sign of comparison,

817
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,680
 no sign of discontent or resentment,

818
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,400
 no manipulation in any way.

819
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,360
 He takes off his own robe and gives it to David.

820
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,880
 Isn't that the solution to envy, to love?

821
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,640
 And here's the key, and this is where I'll finish.

822
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,760
 What Jonathan did for David that day,

823
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,040
 seemingly small thing of taking off his robe

824
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
 and putting it onto David,

825
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,440
 is the same thing that Jesus Christ did for you.

826
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,840
 Jesus Christ, the Prince of Heaven,

827
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,640
 saw you ugly and ashamed,

828
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:44,040
 and yet he took off his robes and put them over you.

829
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,040
 If you let that truth seep into your heart,

830
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,400
 how could you possibly envy?

831
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:59,720
 If you knew who Jesus was and how much he loved you

832
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,480
 and what he gave for you,

833
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,320
 and that all you need can be found in him,

834
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,680
 you have his robe on right now, brothers and sisters.

835
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,560
 How could you possibly envy?

836
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,560
 You have all you need in Jesus.

837
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,280
 And that's my final prayer for all of us,

838
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,160
 because I don't even need a show of hands.

839
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,200
 We all struggle with envy.

840
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,240
 We all struggle with comparison,

841
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,840
 being discontent, being resentful,

842
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,280
 taking matters into our own hands.

843
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,720
 But we all would do well to remember

844
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,280
 what Jonathan did for David,

845
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,800
 what Jesus did for us.

846
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,080
 So whenever we're faced with the temptation again of envy,

847
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,080
 we can say, "No, this time I will praise the Lord.

848
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:02,240
 This time I will look to God who is sovereign,

849
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,440
 who is enough."

850
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,360
 Let's pray.

851
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,720
 (pastor and congregation murmuring)

852
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:20,680
 Jesus, we bow our heads before you.

853
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,040
 I guess if we put it like that,

854
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,680
 it is really quite ridiculous that we still envy,

855
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,680
 that we still get caught up in the patterns of this world.

856
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,000
 We find it so easy to compare ourselves to other people,

857
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,400
 to be unhappy with what we have.

858
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,440
 And yet we remember today what you did for us.

859
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,720
 And we hold on, we cling on to the fact

860
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,800
 that Jesus, that is enough.

861
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,120
 Forgive us, Lord, for forgetting about your act of love.

862
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,120
 And give us the strength to comprehend

863
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,480
 the depth, the breadth, the length,

864
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,320
 and the height of your love for us.

865
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,480
 Because when we get it, when we know it,

866
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,040
 there is no need to compare.

867
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,440
 We remember that we all fall short,

868
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,280
 but are all justified freely by you.

869
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,600
 So I wanna just spend a few moments now,

870
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,120
 as I've been doing a lot of talking,

871
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,320
 but I pray that the Spirit has allowed you to hear this,

872
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,640
 and that it would seep into your hearts.

873
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,240
 And I pray that the Spirit will highlight to you

874
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,680
 if there are any seeds of envy,

875
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,720
 and give you the strength to let go.

876
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,640
 Give you the strength to remember that He sees you,

877
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,760
 right where you are.

878
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,440
 He remembers, He shows concern for you.

879
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,680
 He is listening to the cries of your heart.

880
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:26,560
 And He will give, and He will come through.

881
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,560
 Trust Him, because He is enough.

882
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,140
 (gentle music)
