1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Good evening church, how are you?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Great, wow, not a lively crowd tonight.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 We're talking about women in the Bible

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 and we've been going through this amazing series so far.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Pastor John kicked us off with who?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Eve, that's right, that's right.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And then last week, Julian did an amazing job

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 and told us about the story of Sarah.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And today we're gonna go through the story of Rebecca

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 and who knows a Rebecca in their life?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Who knows a Rebecca in their life?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 It's a very common name and we're gonna learn

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 about the story of Rebecca in the Old Testament.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 It's spelled a little differently, right?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 It's spelled with a K, not with a C.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Modern day, most people are spelled with a C.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 So we're gonna talk about the story of Rebecca

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 and it starts off with the story of Abraham.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Now Abraham knew he was getting old, right?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And he wanted his son to get married.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And so he went to his servant, it says in verse two,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 "I swear by the Lord that you will not take a wife

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 "for my son from the daughter of the Canaanites

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 "among whom I dwell, but go to my country,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 "to my kindred and take a wife for my son there."

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And so this servant made that commitment.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 He made this bold commitment to serve Abraham.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And so he took 10 of his master's camels

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 and departed with a lot of gifts, okay?

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Imagine 10 camels, who's been to the desert before?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Rode on camels, very good.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It wasn't the most comfortable ride.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It wasn't like being in a limousine.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But 10 camels, lots of gifts, and this is where he went.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So he went from Hebron, we'll see in the next slide here,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Hebron, and then he went up to Haran.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And then where was Abraham from?

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 He was from Ur.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And these people, what did they worship?

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 They sort of worshiped the stars.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 They were astronomers, astrologers, right?

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And so he went to Ur.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And he went to Ur with this sort of prayer to God.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 God, now the person, the woman that I meet,

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 may this woman give me a drink

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 because it's been a really long journey,

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 1,450 kilometers, right?

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 If you go around the desert.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And I pray that after she gives me a drink,

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 she will also say that she would give a drink

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 to my camels as well.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And so we read on in verse 13.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It says, "Behold, I am standing at the spring of water,

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 "and the daughters of the men of the city

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 "are coming to draw water.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 "Let this woman be what I prayed for."

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And so we see a picture, sort of a painting

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 from some Italian painter.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And this is sort of the servant in the middle here.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And then you see Rebecca by the well there.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And so as soon as the servant prayed this prayer,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 there was Rebecca, verse 15.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Before he had finished praying,

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 "Behold, Rebecca, who was born of Bethuel,

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 "the son of Michal, and the wife of Nahor,

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 "Abraham's brother, came out with her jar of water

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 "on her shoulder."

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 This young woman was very attractive in appearance.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 "A maiden whom no man has known,

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 "she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 "Then the servant ran to meet her and said,

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 "'Please give me a water to drink from your jar.'

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 "And she said, 'Drink, my lord.'

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 "and gave him a drink.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 "When she had finished giving him a drink,

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 "she said, 'I will draw water for your camels also,'

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 "until they have finished drinking.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 "So she quickly emptied her jar

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 "and went to fill it with water to help the camels drink."

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So anyways, that's the story.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Do you know how many liters camels actually drink?

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Do you know how many liters camels actually drink?

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 20 gallons of water, okay?

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 That's 75 liters, 75 liters.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 So imagine 10 camels, all right?

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 75 liters each.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And maybe your jar is,

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 well, it can't be more than one of those liter,

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I don't know, five liters things outside, right?

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Like, that's crazy.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 The amount of hard work it would take,

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 it would take maybe an hour or more to fill,

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 you know, fulfill the needs of these camels.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And so we see the good of Rebecca from this verse,

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 from these verses.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Firstly, the good is she was attractive.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Not many women in the Bible were commented as attractive.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Only several, actually.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 We preached on one last week.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Sarah was stated as attractive and beautiful.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Esther, right?

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Lot's daughters were also known as beautiful.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 There was also a queen that was named as very beautiful.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And so Rebecca was special.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 She's one of few that were named,

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 was a beautiful, attractive lady.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And it also says that she was a maiden.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So she was pure, unmarried, young woman.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And that she was also, we can see that she's servant-hearted.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 The servant asked for a drink and she was willing.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And not only was she willing, she was also intuitive.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 She's like, oh, you have so many camels.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Let me also help them to have a drink.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And so as soon as the servant saw this woman

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 and how she had answered her prayer from the Lord,

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 he did what?

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 We're gonna see in verse 22.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He showered her with gifts, right?

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 A gold ring, right?

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Bracelets.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Please tell me whose daughter you are.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And she tells him whose daughter she is.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And the servant even asks, right?

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Is there a place for me to stay at your father's house?

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And she even invites him.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And she says, yes, there are many rooms in my father's house.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 There's many, right?

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 You can come and spend the night.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And we can also see what happens later.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Laban or Laban, his brother, and also his father said,

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 in response to meeting the servant

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 and the servant explaining his whole story,

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 this thing that has come from the Lord,

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 we cannot speak to you bad or good.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Behold, Rebecca is before you.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Take her and go.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Let her be the wife of your master's son

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 as the Lord has spoken.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So it's been an incredible journey.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 The servant has traveled 1,450 kilometers by camel.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Now the camel goes like this, right?

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 It was not a comfortable ride.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 He arrives and he prays this prayer

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 and God answers his prayer almost immediately.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 He asks to be going to his house, her house to stay.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And she invites him.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And their parents and the brother was like, yes,

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 what you have said is from the Lord.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Take her.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 This is an amazing romantic story

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 that has been orchestrated by the Lord.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Amazing.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And the brother and mother has this one request.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Let the young woman remain with us a while, 10 days,

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 and then she may go.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 But the servant was like, no, do not delay me.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Since the Lord has prospered my way,

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 send me away that I may go to my master.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 They said, let us call the young woman and ask her.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Then they called Rebecca and said to her,

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 will you go with this man?

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And she said, I will go.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 It's incredible, right?

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 He meets her.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 He stays over and then asks,

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 can I, this is what has happened.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I prayed this prayer.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 God has answered it.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I made this oath to my master.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And now you are, I believe you are the one

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 that God has proposed to marry my master,

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 my master's son.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And the family agrees.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 What do they worship?

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 They worship the stars.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 They worship the astrologers and astronomers.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 They were astrologers and astronomers, right?

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Like, and yet they believed what this servant said.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And they were willing to give their only daughter.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Who would give their daughter away

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 after meeting this servant for one night?

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And they were like, oh, let this daughter stay with us.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 You know, Gordon, would you let one of your daughters?

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Oh yeah.

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 (audience laughing)

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Which one, I'm joking.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 (laughing)

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 It's amazing.

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 The faith of the family.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And then Rebecca as well.

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So we see the good.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 There was no bad things.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 We saw the good, there was no bad.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And we saw the godly.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Rebecca believed this servant.

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Rebecca stood in faith.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 She's never been to Israel or Hebron before.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 She's probably never been really outside of her area.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 The amount of faith it would take to just go.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 There's no, you know, what do you call it?

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 When you look for people to date?

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I don't know.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 (laughing)

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Those apps, Pastor John, I'm joking.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 (laughing)

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Those apps, right?

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 You could see all their profile.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Isaac is this, Isaac is this.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Oh, he looks good in this pose, this pose.

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 There was none of that.

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 She went by faith.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And she was willing to follow.

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And I think as much as we see that she had faith,

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 it was as much as God working in and through her life.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 In and through her life.

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And so she goes back with him.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Immediately, 1,450 kilometers.

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 That's quite a drive for us.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Nevermind going on camels.

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And Isaac was meditating.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And when he lifted his eyes up and saw her coming,

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Rebecca also lifted up her eyes.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 They had this special glow, you know?

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And Rebecca was to the servant,

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 "Who is this man walking in the field, meeting us?"

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And the servant said, "It is my master."

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 So she took a veil and covered herself,

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 just as the traditions of that time,

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and of marriage.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And the servant told Isaac all the things that had happened.

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother,

233
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 and took Rebecca, and she became his wife.

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And he loved her.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 This is an amazing romantic story

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 that had been orchestrated by God himself.

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Isaac, alone here,

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Abraham saying, "Go, find a wife for him

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 "from my father's family, not these Canaanites here

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 "that I live around."

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And she follows in faith.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And he sees her, marries her, and loves her.

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 It's an amazing story.

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It's an amazing story of God working

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 in the life of Rebecca and Isaac, both sides.

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And we also see that this sort of foreshadows the gospel.

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 You have Abraham, the father.

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 You have Isaac, the son, the only son.

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 The servant, it doesn't name here who exactly the servant is,

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 but from Genesis 15 earlier,

252
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 we know that the head servant of Abraham was Elanizer,

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 and his name means God, my help.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And then we see Rebecca as the bride.

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Isn't that sort of like the gospel?

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 God sends his only son, right?

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And he sends his Holy Spirit to help,

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 the helper, the comforter,

259
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 and the bride, the bride of Christ, which is the church.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It foreshadows the beauty of the gospel.

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And we see similarities between Isaac and Jesus, right?

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Isaac was promised, right?

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 How old was Abraham?

264
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 He was around 100 years old.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Sarah was 90.

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But God said, "You will have a child."

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Isaac was promised.

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Jesus was promised.

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 He was prophesied, over 300 prophecies about him.

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Jesus appeared at the appointed time.

271
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Isaac came after a long time of waiting

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 from Abraham and Sarah.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 They were both miracle childs, right?

274
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Jesus was born of a virgin.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Abraham and Sarah had Isaac at a very old age.

276
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 It was a miracle.

277
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 They were both have special names from the Lord.

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Both were offered as a sacrifice, right?

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Abraham went up to the mountain

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 and was about to offer his son

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 because the Lord had commanded.

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And that foreshadows what Jesus did.

283
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Thousands of years later,

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Jesus dying on the cross.

285
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And Jesus prepares a place for us in heaven.

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And Isaac prepared a place for his bride here.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 There's also similarities between Rebecca and the church, right?

288
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Rebecca was chosen by God.

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 The church, we are the chosen, right?

290
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 We're chosen to do his ministry.

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Be the hands and feet of God.

292
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 We are part, the church is a part of God's eternal purpose.

293
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 He has a plan for us

294
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 to use us for his eternal purposes

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 to accomplish the work of the gospel.

296
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Rebecca was part of the plan.

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 The plan to accomplish the promises of God.

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Both were destined to share in glory with the son.

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Rebecca learned of Isaac through his servant, Elanizar.

300
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The church learns of Jesus through the Holy Spirit.

301
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Rebecca had to surrender everything

302
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 so that she could serve and be married in joy

303
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 to fulfill the promises of God.

304
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And the church, we also have to surrender our past,

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 deny ourself, take up the cross and follow him.

306
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Both Rebecca and the church are loved and cared for.

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 What an amazing story

308
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 that foreshadows the beauty of the gospel.

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 An amazing story.

310
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 We're gonna continue with the second part of the story.

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Now, things always get interesting

312
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 when kids are involved, right?

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 John and Sandra was life so much more interesting

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 when kids, yeah?

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And so we see here in the next part,

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 verse 19, Abraham fathered Isaac

317
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca.

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 And Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 because she was barren and the Lord granted his prayer.

320
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And Rebecca, his wife conceived.

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Verse 22, the children struggled together within her

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 and she said, "If it is thus, why is this happening to me?"

323
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 So she went to inquire of the Lord

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 and the Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb.

325
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 "And two peoples within you shall be divided.

326
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 "The one shall be stronger than the other

327
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 "and the older shall serve the younger."

328
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And so here are the good things we see about Rebecca in this.

329
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Well, it says Isaac prayed for his wife

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 'cause they couldn't conceive, right?

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And we'll learn it was quite a length of time

332
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 that Rebecca could not conceive.

333
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And so Isaac prayed for his wife.

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 We see this pattern of prayer, meditation.

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 When Isaac was waiting for his wife, Rebecca, to come,

336
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 he was also meditating and now he prays for his wife.

337
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 That's a great thing.

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And God provided twins.

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 The first twins in the Bible, who's a twin here?

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 We know of one, one very special lady, Agnes.

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 (laughs)

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Agnes has a twin, right?

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And so twins, the first twins in the Bible, it's amazing.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 It's also good that Rebecca inquired of the Lord.

345
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 There was a struggle within her.

346
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And God answered her prayer with a prophecy.

347
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 It's amazing, this prophecy.

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 How would you feel if you received this prophecy

349
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 that there's two nations in your womb, right?

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 How would you feel that these two people will be divided?

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Oh, two nations, oh, that's pretty cool.

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 But it's gonna be divided?

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 These two kids?

354
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 One shall serve the other?

355
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 The older shall serve the younger?

356
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 How does that work?

357
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 How would you feel if you were Rebecca?

358
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It would be a pretty confusing prophecy, right?

359
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 You'd be like, what's going on, God?

360
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 What's going on?

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And so we see what happens at birth.

362
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 There are twins in the womb.

363
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 The first came out red, all his body like a hairy coat.

364
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And they named him Esau because of that.

365
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And then the brother came out holding what?

366
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Holding Esau's heel.

367
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And so they named him Jacob.

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And Isaac was 60 years old when she bore them.

369
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 How old was Isaac when he got married?

370
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 40.

371
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 They waited 20 years for kids.

372
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 20 years.

373
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And so we see the good.

374
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 But we also see the bad.

375
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter,

376
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 man of the field, and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.

377
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And so because of that, Isaac loved Esau

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 because he ate of his game.

379
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But Rebecca loved Jacob.

380
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And so the bad thing was favoritism.

381
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And whenever there's favoritism in the family,

382
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 it complicates things.

383
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 There's jealousy is involved.

384
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And jealousy can lead to anger and hatred and betrayal

385
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 and all these sort of things.

386
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And so we see, I'm just gonna summarize

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 one of the classic stories, right?

388
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Jacob and Esau.

389
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Who's the older?

390
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Esau.

391
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And so Esau, according to the customs back then,

392
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 he had the birthright, all right?

393
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And so he was very hungry one time, all right?

394
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Imagine you went for a 10K run or a marathon, right?

395
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And you come back and you're just famished.

396
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 You're like, "Oh, I'm starving."

397
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And Jacob has this delicious stew just right there.

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And Esau's like, "Give me some of that stew, man,

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 "or I'm gonna die."

400
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And Jacob, you know, his name is clutching the heel

401
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 or sort of a trickster.

402
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 So he wants something in return.

403
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And what he wants is the birthright.

404
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And the birthright represented several things.

405
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 The first is a double portion of the inheritance.

406
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Okay, a double portion.

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So it means you get two thirds, all right?

408
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And your brother gets one third.

409
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 That's quite significant, right?

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Especially 'cause Abraham had a lot, right?

411
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And then it also represented

412
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 that you would become the spiritual leader

413
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 after the father died.

414
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 So those were the two things that we saw.

415
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Later, Abraham and, sorry, Isaac and Sarah,

416
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 they live in this region, right?

417
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And they meet Abimelech.

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Sorry, how do you say his name?

419
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 - Abimelech. - Abimelech, right?

420
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Abimelech, who was a king of the Philistines.

421
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And Abimelech says, "Oh, you can live here."

422
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Right?

423
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 "But who is this lady?

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 "Who's this nice lady beside you?

425
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 "Very attractive."

426
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And just like Abraham, right?

427
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Abraham makes the same mistake as,

428
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 or Isaac makes the same mistake as Abraham.

429
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And he says, "Well, this is my sister."

430
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And later, the king finds out.

431
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And he's like, "Why are you lying?"

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 You know, something could have happened to her.

433
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 "Why are you lying?"

434
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So imagine Rebecca having to pretend

435
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 to be the sister of Isaac for several years.

436
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So maybe she's a good actor as well, right?

437
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 She's a good actor.

438
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 And finally, we're gonna look at the story.

439
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 The final story is this.

440
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 As Abraham, or as Isaac approaches near his death.

441
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 So Isaac was old and his eyes were dim.

442
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 He couldn't really see.

443
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And so he felt like it was time.

444
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It was time.

445
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And he called Esau, "My son, you know,

446
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 "behold, I'm gonna bless you.

447
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 "First, what you're gonna do,

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 "you're gonna go out, take some game,

449
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 "you know, get some game,

450
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 "and then prepare it for me.

451
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 "And then I will be able to bless you before I die."

452
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 All right, this is like the final deathbed

453
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 that actually, you know, Isaac lives for,

454
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 you know, I think 20 more years or something like that.

455
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 But he felt like it was time

456
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 to pass on this blessing, this birthright.

457
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And so what happens is Rebecca overhears.

458
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Let's read together, verse five, one, two, three.

459
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 "Now Rebecca was listening

460
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 "when Isaac spoke of his son Esau.

461
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 "So when Esau went to the field

462
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 "to hunt for game and bring it,

463
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 "Rebecca said to her son Jacob,

464
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 "'I heard your father speak to Esau.

465
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 "'Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats

466
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 "'so that I may prepare from them

467
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 "'delicious food for your father,

468
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 "'such as he loves,

469
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "'and you shall bring it to your father to eat

470
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 "'so that he may bless you before he dies.'"

471
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Let's continue reading, verse 11.

472
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 "So Jacob said to Rebecca, his mother,

473
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 "'Behold, my brother Esau is a very hairy man

474
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 "'and I am a smooth one.

475
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 "'Perhaps my father will feel me,

476
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 "'and mocking me,

477
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 "'and bring curses upon myself and not a blessing.'

478
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 "His mother said to him,

479
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 "'Let your curse be on me, my son.

480
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 "'Only obey my voice and go, bring them to me.'

481
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 "So we saw the good.

482
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 "We saw the bad, favoritism.

483
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 "And now we see the ugly."

484
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 So Rebecca receives this prophecy

485
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 that the old will serve the younger,

486
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 the nation will be divided,

487
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 the stronger will serve the weaker.

488
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And yet she is trying to have manipulative scheming

489
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 to get her own way, right?

490
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 She overhears, she overhears.

491
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Mothers hear everything in the home, right?

492
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 They hear everything.

493
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 They have really good intuition.

494
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And so what she does,

495
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 she convinces Jacob to deceive Isaac.

496
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And Isaac is hesitant, right?

497
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Like, I don't wanna deceive my father.

498
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 My father is very hairy, I'm smooth.

499
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Like, there's gonna be curses upon me, right?

500
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 So what does Rebecca do?

501
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 She goes so far as to say,

502
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 let the curses fall upon her.

503
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 She's willing to be the sacrifice

504
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 for what would happen.

505
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And so obviously Jacob goes along with this, right?

506
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Oh, okay, that's fine.

507
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 You'll take all the curses.

508
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 There's nothing for me really to lose.

509
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 The problem with this

510
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 is that the whole family did not trust each other.

511
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Did Isaac know of the prophecy?

512
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 It doesn't really say.

513
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 We don't know.

514
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 But he might've overheard the prophecy, right?

515
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 So some commentaries say this,

516
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 that he knew of the prophecy

517
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 and also tried to get his own way

518
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 because he loved Esau.

519
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And Esau did not trust the family.

520
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He actually, he sold his birthright to Jacob.

521
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But yet what's happening here?

522
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 He's trying to get the blessing from Isaac.

523
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 So he, well, he's deceiving Jacob as well

524
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 because he supposedly sold his birthright.

525
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Jacob should be the one receiving the blessing.

526
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And then obviously Jacob deceives his father

527
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 and then steals the blessing from his brother.

528
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And the mother is the master schemer of all of it.

529
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 What a wonderful family.

530
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 They lie, they deceive, they manipulate,

531
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 they scheme against each other.

532
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 It's ugly.

533
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 It's very ugly.

534
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And then in the end,

535
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 later Esau plans to kill Jacob

536
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 because he learns that Jacob has stolen the blessing.

537
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And so Rebecca sends Jacob away

538
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 to hide at his brother's house in Haran.

539
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And so in a sense,

540
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 one, he's lost sort of both children.

541
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 One he's had to sent away because of hiding

542
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 and the other,

543
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Esau might be angry with her

544
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 because she's the one that's sort of behind all this.

545
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And so what are the lessons that we need to learn here

546
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 from today's message of Rebecca?

547
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 The first lesson is this,

548
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 that God keeps his promises.

549
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Abraham's promise,

550
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 God's promise to Abraham was this,

551
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars.

552
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And Isaac was not married.

553
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And so God fulfilled it

554
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 through the promise of Rebecca.

555
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And so we also see, the second lesson is this,

556
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 that God works when we don't see it.

557
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 God was working in the life of Rebecca.

558
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 God was working in the life of Isaac

559
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 and they both met miraculously.

560
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 The next thing we need to learn is

561
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 that we need to wait and trust in God's promises.

562
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Rebecca knew that the nations would be divided within her,

563
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 but she didn't wait.

564
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 She didn't trust in the Lord.

565
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 She thought she could do it herself.

566
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And so she used scheming and deceit

567
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 to accomplish what she thought she wanted

568
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 'cause she favored Jacob.

569
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And lastly, we need to learn

570
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 that the blessings come from God.

571
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Each family member tried to get the blessing

572
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 or give the blessing through their own strength,

573
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 through their own power.

574
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Isaac tried to steal back the blessing

575
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 using his own strength.

576
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Jacob tried to deceive to get the blessing.

577
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 But in the end, we must know

578
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 that the blessing comes from the Lord.

579
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And so today, do we trust in God's promises?

580
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Are you trusting in God's promises today?

581
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 The promise of eternal life,

582
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 the promise of the Holy Spirit helping us,

583
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 the promise that one day He will return,

584
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 that He has a plan for each one of us

585
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 'cause we are the children of God.

586
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Do you trust in His promises and His plan?

587
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And do you trust in God's timing?

588
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 God has the best timing.

589
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 God has the best timing for Isaac and Rebecca to get married.

590
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 God had the best timing for them to have children.

591
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 God has His best timing.

592
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And lastly, do we believe that the blessings come from God?

593
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Many times we try to get the blessings

594
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 or gain blessings for ourselves through our own strength.

595
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 But we must recognize that ultimately,

596
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 all good things come from the Lord.

597
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Must wait upon His blessings.

598
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 As you know, we've been teaching these students English

599
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 in our English Mentorship Program at Chan Baksa,

600
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 this school in the South side, South Island side.

601
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And it's been a year of personal messaging,

602
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 telling them, inviting them to come.

603
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 It's been having lunches with them, treating them.

604
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 It's been playing basketball with them, teaching them English.

605
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 And finally, we had sort of an evangelistic meeting yesterday

606
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 and 191 people showed up yesterday.

607
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 And some of them brought their parents.

608
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And we've been teaching them Bible stories

609
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 in our English Mentorship Program.

610
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 We first taught them about the parable of the talents.

611
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And then we talked about Jonah.

612
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And now we've been talking about David.

613
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And then yesterday,

614
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 it was the first time we really introduced the gospel to them.

615
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And when the speaker invited people

616
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 to ask Jesus into their life,

617
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 some of them were like, "Ah, maybe I'll do it.

618
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 "Maybe I'll do it."

619
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And then eventually, we can see

620
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 around 40 of these students rose their hand

621
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 and asked Jesus, prayed the prayer,

622
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 (congregation applauding)

623
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 and asked Jesus into their life.

624
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 It's an amazing story.

625
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 It didn't all happen in one night.

626
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 It was hard work.

627
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 It was trusting in the Lord that He is working.

628
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Sometimes it was frustrating.

629
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Sometimes it was tiring.

630
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 But we trusted in the Lord.

631
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 We trusted that the blessing comes from the Lord.

632
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And so,

633
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 do we trust that the blessing comes from the Lord today?

634
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Let's just take a time to bow down our heads.

635
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Heavenly Father,

636
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 forgive us

637
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 for trusting in our own works.

638
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Forgive us for trusting that we could make things right,

639
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 that our plan is best.

640
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Help us, Lord, to surrender to You,

641
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 to acknowledge that You have what is best for us,

642
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 to trust in Your timing,

643
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 and to believe that the blessings come ultimately from You.

644
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.

645
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
