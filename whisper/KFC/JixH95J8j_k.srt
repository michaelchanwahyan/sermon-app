1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Today I will share with you about the KFCC.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I have said for a long time that I will go to KFCC.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 I will go this year.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I will step out of this place in May or June.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 You may see me on Sunday.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 I will be at KFCC.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 KFCC is not about last year or recently.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 It is because of the idea of 2020.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I hope that through the 4 walls of the church,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 we can lead people to the community and serve those in need.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 What have we done in the past few years?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I have a short clip to share with you.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Please share the clip with me.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 In this short clip, I have talked about what we have done in the past 2-3 years.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 If you pay attention, you will see that in August,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 we held a "Dream Flyer" event in the second floor.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 It teaches students how to fly a plane.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 If you notice, there is a girl who is sitting on a wheelchair.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 This girl is just like everyone else.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 She is healthy. She is not born with it.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 However, during COVID-19,

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 she had her first vaccine and became like this.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 She could not move her whole body.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Only her head could move.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 When we heard about this, we were shocked.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 How could this happen?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 She is just like us. She is a lively girl.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 She is a normal student.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 But in the end, she had to spend her life on a wheelchair.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 When she arrived, her mood was not good.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 She thought that she had not been to church before.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 She did not know why, but she knew about this event.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 She was still able to believe that her dream would come true.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Although she was sitting on a wheelchair,

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 she still believed that her dream could come true.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So she joined this event.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 When she arrived, everyone was shocked to hear her story.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 We did not have any sympathy or anything special for her.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 We just wanted to make it easier for her to participate.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 If you saw the video, we were playing a game of wheelchairs.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 She could join us.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 After four days of church,

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 her parents came to visit her.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 They were very grateful to God.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 They believed in Jesus and were saved.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I believe that in the future,

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 there will be more stories like this in KFCC.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 These stories will not only happen in KFCC.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I believe that everyone here has their own story.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Your stories can also inspire the local people to know God better.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Today, I would like to share a scripture with you.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 This scripture is in Proverbs 11, 24-28.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It says,

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 "Those who have a good heart are more generous,

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 those who are too cautious are rebellious,

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 those who are too selfish are too generous,

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 those who are too wise are too wise."

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 It is obvious that those who are too cautious

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 will receive more blessings and more blessings.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Those who are helpful will receive more blessings.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 This is a very special principle in the Bible.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Why? Because it is said in the world that

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 the more we save, the more we will have.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Is this what the world thinks?

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The more we save, the more we will have.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But it is completely different in the law of God.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 When we are willing to share with others,

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 God has given us resources,

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 which include money, time, love, and talent.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 God has bestowed all these things on us.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 If we are willing to share our time, love, and talent,

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 our lives will be more abundant.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 It is not just about material abundance.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Our souls will be more abundant.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 On the other hand, it is also said that

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 when we are not willing to share with others,

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 we may lose what we have.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Why?

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 When we are not willing to share with others,

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 we will naturally feel empty and lonely,

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 and even lose the blessings from God.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I would like to share with you

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 the love, talent, time, and material abundance

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 that Jesus Christ has given us.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Why do we need to care for those in need?

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 First, if we are Christians,

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 this is a testimony of love.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 When we practice the teachings of Jesus Christ,

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 we are shown the love of Jesus Christ by others.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 When we sit here every week,

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 we hear that the core value of Christianity is love.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Do we sit here every week and be a Christian?

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 No, we don't.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 We must practice what we have learned

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 and show the love of Jesus Christ to others.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Second, we need to change the lives of those in need.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 A simple action can change a person's life.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 I remember that I did an interview with Dr. Ho

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 and the women in the interview were all single parents.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 When they see young people visiting them,

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 they are the happiest.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Not only can they have time to talk to them,

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 but they can also have life-changing interactions.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 I believe this is an important element of life-changing.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Third, we need to cultivate our character.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 We need to learn to be reasonable,

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 to know the needs of others,

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 to be patient and to be grateful.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 These are all precious characteristics of life.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Gratefulness.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Everyone sitting here, including me,

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I think we all need to be grateful.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Because it is not necessary for us to be able to breathe,

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 to sit here and to go to church.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 We need to learn to be grateful.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Have you heard of the story of a child?

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I shared it with you.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 They have never eaten mooncakes.

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They have never eaten radish cakes.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I believe that by the new year,

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 they will not want to eat them anymore.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 There are many children and families

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 who have never even eaten radish cakes.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 So our gratitude is not only for the life-giving elements,

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 but also for the good family,

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 which has enough food and supplies.

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 So I ask God to help us learn to be grateful.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Young people, how do you practice this concern?

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I hope you can participate in volunteer activities,

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 community services, church care,

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 volunteer work and charity activities.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I hope you will do these volunteer activities with a sincere heart.

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I believe that some of these activities are not sincere.

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I know that many of you have to take exams at university.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 So you have to do it for a better portfolio.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 But it is not sincere.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I have seen some young people

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 who have no smile on their faces when they do volunteer work.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I think to myself, "Why don't you go home?"

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 So if you want to do it,

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 you really have to do it with a sincere heart.

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 If you don't want to participate in volunteer work,

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 you can start to learn to care about the people around you,

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 including your classmates, family and neighbors.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 You can learn to care about them.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Share time and resources.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Simply accompany, listen and share life materials.

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 You can accompany your friends.

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Listen to them and tell them whether they are happy or not.

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 You don't accompany them to play games.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 You don't accompany them to overcome obstacles.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 You don't need to accompany them too much.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Finally, I want to share with you.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 The Bible has told us that

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 in the 20th chapter of the book of Exodus,

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 there is a saying,

157
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 "The more you give, the more you will receive."

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 When we can give with a sincere heart,

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 we will feel contentment and joy.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 When we know why we need to help others,

161
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 we can become God's hands and feet.

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 God can do it, but he does it through you.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 He brings his love to every corner.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 We say that caring has many benefits.

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 First, we can do some explorations

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 to reduce the loneliness of the elders.

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 We can encourage our friends to go out and do activities.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 We can help those in need.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 When we have abundant material,

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 we are willing to help those in need.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 We say we want a fair society.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 What is the real fairness?

173
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 We need to think about what is the real fairness.

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I have told you before what is fairness.

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Six char siu bao for two people.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 What do you think is fairness?

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Three for each person.

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It is very fair.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 But one person just finished a very full meal of buffet.

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 The other person didn't eat for two days.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 How can we be fair if we share the char siu bao for two people?

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 So we need to learn what is the real fairness.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 We will discuss it in your group.

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 The power of caring is great.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 We often say we are helping others.

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 We seem to be very good at helping others.

187
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 But we have grown up in the process of helping others.

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 We have cultivated empathy and responsibility.

189
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 We can also encourage the community to help those in need

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 through different activities.

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 We can help the community to make progress.

192
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 We can help those in need and

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 encourage those who want to move up.

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 We can reduce the government's expenses.

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 We can make the world a better place.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Lastly, I want to encourage everyone.

197
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 You are all young, talented and have a heart.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I hope you can take this step with courage

199
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 and help those in need with your heart.

200
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Don't underestimate your own small actions.

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Because every action of yours can bring a lot of change.

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 God has given us a lot of grace and ability.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 If we are willing,

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 we can make a big change with our small actions.

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I think we can always play and have fun.

206
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 But if you can use your time to think about

207
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 what you can do for others,

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I believe you can make others happier.

209
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 We have different activities in the South District.

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I have a little announcement.

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 On 24th December, the Peace Day,

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 which is the Peace Day in 2025,

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 we will be at the Hong Kong Children's Centre.

214
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 If you live in that area,

215
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 you will know that there used to be a kindergarten there.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 We are at the kindergarten.

217
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Jose, you are the closest.

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 So you can come and help us.

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 What will we do at the Hong Kong Children's Centre?

220
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We will have a radio broadcast for half a day.

221
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I hope we can make a radio team.

222
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 We will have a time slot for the local residents.

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Please continue to help us.

224
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 We can help people who are close to us.

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 We can also help people from far away.

226
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 God has given us different leaders and ideas.

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I am happy to have invited two former students.

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 They have different ideas of God.

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 They have been to different places and countries

230
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 to spread the message of God.

231
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 They have spread the message of God.

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Not only helping the local people,

233
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 but also spreading the message of God to others.

234
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I would like to invite Mavis to share with us.

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Good morning everyone.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 My name is Mavis.

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I am currently a fourth year student in university,

238
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 studying in Australia.

239
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Like many of you, I also grew up in this church.

240
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I just came back from a month-long trip

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 in Nagoya, Japan last December.

242
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Have you ever heard of the word "missions"?

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 For me, I first heard of "missions"

244
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 from a vacation Bible study when I was younger.

245
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I always thought missionaries looked like this.

246
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 They are blonde, kind, and courageous.

247
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 They go to Africa to help kids who are hungry

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 and in need of help.

249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 As a kid, I found these people very inspiring.

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I never really put much thought into it.

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I grew up in a Christian family.

252
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I went to church every Sunday.

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I thought being a Christian was just going to church

254
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 every week, memorizing scripture, getting stickers,

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 and generally being a kind person because

256
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 love your neighbor as yourself and something like that.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 But I never really understood what I was claiming

258
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 to believe in and why it is so important to myself.

259
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Before going to university, I was super shy

260
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 and introverted.

261
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I probably still am.

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I did not know if I could make any friends,

263
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 but God was really gracious to me.

264
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 During my first year, a girl from my church

265
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 invited me to a camp held by a Christian club

266
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 on my campus.

267
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I did not know anyone but her, so I was hesitating

268
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 if I should go or not.

269
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But I don't know what got into me,

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 but I decided to go and take a step.

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 At that camp, I met a lot of Christian uni students.

272
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Though they did not know me, they were really,

273
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 really kind and welcoming and interested to chat.

274
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 As I got a chance to hear their stories

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 and their journeys with God, I saw how God

276
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 has transformed them, and they were all super joyful

277
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 and confident.

278
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 But on the other hand, I look at myself

279
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 and I only see what I could share was only

280
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 I grew up in a Christian family, and I think I'm Christian.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 After that camp, I felt very convicted

282
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 to learn more about Christianity.

283
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 So I joined the Christian club and started my journey

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 on being discipled by a missionary.

285
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 We also did walk up, so it was like walking up

286
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 to strangers every week to ask them about their faith

287
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 and their background.

288
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Mind you, I was still very, very shy and did not know much

289
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 about the Bible and theology and stuff like that.

290
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 The first few times were super intimidating,

291
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 and I got really, really tired afterwards.

292
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 I probably still do get really tired after doing that.

293
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But after stepping out of my comfort zone,

294
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 that was when I really experienced the power of God

295
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 and the power of prayer.

296
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Before we go out to talk to strangers on campus, we pray.

297
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I usually feel super awkward because you don't really

298
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 know how the conversation is going to go.

299
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 But every time I go out, I am reminded that I cannot

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 control other people's minds.

301
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I can't control how they think of me.

302
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 So the only thing I could do was to rely on God and pray.

303
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 So because of that, I got a chance to meet a lot

304
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 of different people, and God surprises me every time

305
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 in different conversations.

306
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So back to Japan.

307
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Random question for everyone.

308
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Has anyone here been to Japan?

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Okay, cool.

310
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So if so, or if not, what do you think when you think of Japan?

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 For me, I think what I think about when I think about Japan

312
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 is manga, anime, shrines, and food,

313
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 and maybe cool technology.

314
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And missional work was definitely not on my list.

315
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 So on the surface, Japan seems pretty cool, right?

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And very rich country.

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But you guys may know, Japanese culture and work culture

318
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 is very, very stressful.

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 There's also a term for death by overwork called "karoashi."

320
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 And Japan being a very homogenous country,

321
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 being different from society is seen as being

322
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 disrespectful of peace.

323
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So there's a Japanese proverb that says,

324
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 "deru koe wa utareru," which means,

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 "The nail that sticks out is hammered down."

326
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So a little context about Japan.

327
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So the population in Japan is about 126 million people,

328
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 and only 1 to 2%, as you can see over there,

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 the red, are Christian.

330
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 So being a Christian is definitely very, very difficult

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 and very different from societal norms in Japan.

332
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 The Christian population being really small in Japan,

333
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Japanese people have never met a Christian in their lives before.

334
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Some of them don't even know the meaning behind Christmas.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 So it reminded me of this verse in the Bible that says,

336
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 "How then can they call on the one they have not believed in,

337
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 and how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard,

338
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 and how can they hear without someone preaching to them,

339
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and how can anyone preach unless they're sent?

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news."

341
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Many people think that going to mission means going to help people

342
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 that are less fortunate or going to help people that are sick or in need.

343
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 However, a missionary in Japan said this,

344
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 "I cannot show you photos of hungry children, wells to be dug,

345
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 and churches to be built, but I can show you building after building

346
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 of people that do not know God."

347
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 This really got to me.

348
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I think I was really fortunate to have been in a Christian family

349
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 and had so many opportunities to hear about God's love for me growing up.

350
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 However, in Japan, it is super rare to even find one Christian.

351
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 That is why I went on this mission.

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 So what does mission actually look like?

353
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 I went with a group of 11 people,

354
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 and we got on five different university campuses throughout our month there.

355
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Our main goal was to connect with new students that we meet on campus

356
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 and journey alongside Christian students that are already connected with local staff.

357
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 So we held events such as a Thanksgiving party--wait, where is it--

358
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 a Thanksgiving party, a little girls' night--what else--

359
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 a Christmas party, a Christmas English lesson,

360
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 and also other things that they have over there.

361
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Every Friday they have a little fellowship.

362
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It was actually not really like work, work, but it's more like connecting with people

363
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 and chatting with the students there.

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 I want to end with a little story.

365
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 During our farewell party, a Japanese Christian student named Tomoe

366
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 shared a little bit of her testimony.

367
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 She shared that she has always been a Christian,

368
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 but found it really, really hard to say it publicly

369
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 because of the fear of how people would react when they know she's a Christian.

370
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 She shared that after meeting the team of Australian students

371
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 and doing outreach together, it reminded her of this passage.

372
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 "For I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God

373
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 that brings salvation to everyone who believes,

374
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 first to Jews and then to the Gentiles."

375
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I'm not sure about you.

376
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Have you been ashamed of your faith?

377
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 If so, I hope this passage encourages you.

378
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Please continue to pray for the ministry in Japan.

379
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 People in Japan really need God.

380
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I just want to pray for--please pray for God to continue to send workers there

381
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 and as the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.

382
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 This is the end. Thank you for listening.

383
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 If you have any questions, we can have a chat and stuff after.

384
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Thanks, guys.

385
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Thank you, Mavis, for sharing a little bit of your experience.

386
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 In Asia, traveling is a good thing.

387
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 But in the case of the Catholic Church,

388
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Japan is a country of rocks.

389
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It needs a voice to reach this place.

390
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Mavis is one of our mentors.

391
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 She is the daughter of Auntie Maggie.

392
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Those white-handed people are a bit loud.

393
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 So I think when we become the second or third generation of Christians,

394
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 we need to be grateful.

395
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Not everyone can keep this good faith.

396
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 God, please continue to help us.

397
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Next, Cody will share with us.

398
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Cody didn't go to Asia to preach.

399
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 He went to a place in Europe.

400
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 He will introduce himself.

401
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Before I start, I want you to stand up.

402
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Then sit down.

403
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Are you tired?

404
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 No? Never mind.

405
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 I want to say that every time you do something,

406
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 there is a price.

407
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 I am a lazy person.

408
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 If the action has no real meaning, I won't do it.

409
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 If someone asked me to stand up, I wouldn't do it.

410
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 I admire you all.

411
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Very good.

412
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I will explain why I went to Europe to serve God.

413
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 The first picture is of my dad and me.

414
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 My dad is my role model.

415
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 He had cancer at that time.

416
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 He couldn't eat well and sleep well.

417
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 But he continued to read the Bible and preach.

418
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Isn't it tiring?

419
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Normal people would be tired.

420
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 My mom was also tired.

421
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 It's not easy to take care of a sick person.

422
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 But when you see him serving at church,

423
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 or when he is not feeling well,

424
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 you still want to serve him.

425
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Why?

426
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I thought,

427
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 what made my mom and dad serve God so diligently?

428
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 It was because they saw God's power of transformation.

429
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 God saved our family.

430
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 But this is my parents' story.

431
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Even if I saw God's power,

432
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I didn't think it was related to me.

433
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 I thought I would follow God for my whole life.

434
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 God is the one I will follow for my whole life.

435
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 But from my school,

436
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I went to a primary school and then went to a university.

437
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I didn't think about what I would do for God.

438
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I don't know what you think of doing something for God.

439
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 But for me,

440
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 doing something for God is a big deal.

441
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I was a little boy.

442
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I didn't have the ability to do anything for God.

443
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 I just prayed.

444
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 When I entered university,

445
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I thought I must do all the things I learned in university.

446
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 I didn't have time to do anything else.

447
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 But when I entered university,

448
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I still wanted to find a fellowship.

449
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 There were a group of Catholics who were my peers.

450
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But by accident,

451
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I accidentally joined a student movement,

452
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Campus Crusade.

453
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 The organization was amazing.

454
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 It was an organization that encouraged young people to preach the gospel and serve God.

455
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 It was the first time that someone could make people on this earth

456
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 who had never heard the gospel

457
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 believe in a statement that was very meaningful.

458
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I thought,

459
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 "Why can I, as a family,

460
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 experience such a transformative event?

461
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 But what about others?"

462
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 As the Roman Catholic priest, Mavis, said,

463
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 "There is no chance to hear it."

464
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I started to think about what I could do.

465
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 I saw that these students were my age.

466
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Why did people my age love God so much?

467
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 How much did they love God?

468
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 They loved the people God loved.

469
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 After they had this love,

470
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 as Pastor Irene said,

471
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 this love had action.

472
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I followed them and slowly learned how to preach the gospel

473
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 and how to care for others.

474
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 But if you have ever tried to preach the gospel,

475
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 you need to have a thick skin.

476
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 You don't have to be embarrassed.

477
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Just like Mavis,

478
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 she had to go to the front and preach.

479
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 It was really embarrassing.

480
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 But in the past few years,

481
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 I started to train my skin to be a little thicker.

482
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 When did I start training my skin?

483
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 There were two countries.

484
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 One was on the left.

485
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 You can't guess where it was.

486
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 It was Vietnam.

487
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I went to Vietnam with my students.

488
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 When I was in the Explorer program,

489
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 I had to go to Vietnam to preach.

490
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 What was most impressive was not the need of the place.

491
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 There was a person who was there.

492
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 He was a 20-year-old student.

493
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 He was serving in Vietnam.

494
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I looked at him and thought,

495
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 "He is so young, but he is already serving God.

496
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Can I dedicate my youth to God in the future?"

497
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 But I didn't tell anyone when I came back.

498
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Because you know,

499
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 when you come back and tell anyone,

500
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 they will push you to do something.

501
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I didn't tell anyone.

502
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 But I still had an action.

503
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 I bought a book called "Divorce"

504
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 which is about the Sunday prayer of the Catholic Church.

505
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 In addition to the article,

506
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 there were prayers for different countries.

507
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I still thought that I could do something in the Explorer program.

508
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 I could pray.

509
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 The second country was Ireland.

510
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It was a green country.

511
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 What made me most worried was

512
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 that I went to an exchange program for half a year.

513
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I had a great time there for half a year.

514
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 But behind the joy,

515
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 I saw that many Europeans

516
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 couldn't hear the prayer.

517
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 We just said that the prayer of worship is the answer of God.

518
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 But they only had many questions.

519
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 The answer was right in front of them.

520
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 They couldn't see the answer.

521
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 So I felt very sad.

522
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 It was like the people in this country

523
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 really needed to find the answer.

524
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 But guess what I did after that?

525
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 After that deep pain?

526
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 I prayed.

527
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 I just prayed.

528
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 But don't get me wrong.

529
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Prayer is the foundation of all ministries.

530
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 The ministry of the Lord's Prayer needs to start with prayer.

531
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Or maybe God wants me to pray.

532
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Okay, let's go.

533
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 At the end, I had to graduate from university.

534
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 I went to a camp.

535
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 I participated in the student movement.

536
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 At the end of each year,

537
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 there was a call for prayer.

538
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 What is a call for prayer?

539
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 It's an article.

540
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 After the call, the callers would be invited to respond

541
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 to the actions of the people of the camp.

542
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 When I entered the camp,

543
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 I thought, "It's okay. It's none of my business."

544
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 I started to look for a job.

545
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 I was a normal person who just returned from work.

546
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 I was already content.

547
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 But when I was in Fuzhou,

548
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I was asked,

549
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 "If God wants you to serve Him in your whole life,

550
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 will you respond to Him without hesitation?"

551
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 This call was a negative response.

552
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 It was a no-turning-back response.

553
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 When I heard this question,

554
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 I felt like I was being asked.

555
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 If I didn't respond,

556
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I wouldn't be able to do it.

557
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 At that moment, I knew very clearly

558
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 that this was a call from God.

559
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 So I responded to this call.

560
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 I forgot to introduce this.

561
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 I was in my first year of studying at the Catholic School of the Apostles.

562
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 After I graduated,

563
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I would serve God as a pastor.

564
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 A few days before I entered the school,

565
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 I opened my Bible.

566
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 It was filled with the words of my time.

567
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 God encouraged me in this way.

568
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 He was the God who called me.

569
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 After I graduated,

570
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I returned to Ireland.

571
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 I joined a police station called Operation Mobilization.

572
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 It was a local church.

573
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Although it was a European country,

574
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 there were few Catholics there.

575
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 It was not very developed.

576
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 There were many sheep and farmers.

577
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 I found out that the church did more than I imagined.

578
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 It was not just a weekly visit to the city.

579
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 It was a weekly visit to the community.

580
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 I would bring people to the church

581
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 and find the answer in their conversations.

582
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 But three years later,

583
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 I still feel very sad.

584
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Why can't they hear the call of God?

585
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 When I left, I had a big expectation.

586
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 One day,

587
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Ireland would no longer need a Catholic church,

588
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 or missionaries.

589
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 On the surface of the earth,

590
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 there would no longer be a need for missionaries.

591
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 So I left the country with this expectation.

592
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 But I knew that I had to serve God well.

593
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I had to dedicate my life to God.

594
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 I had to be used by God.

595
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 But to serve God well,

596
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 I had to do one thing.

597
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 I had to study.

598
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Why did I have to study?

599
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Because I had to learn about the equipment of the church.

600
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I had to know what I believed in.

601
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I heard a lot about the church,

602
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 but I had to systematically learn everything.

603
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 I had to know about the equipment,

604
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 and I had to know that I had to follow my heart.

605
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 You know,

606
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 I want to say that

607
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 there are so many things to learn about the church.

608
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 If I didn't do more,

609
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 how could I have learned so much?

610
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 So I went to study.

611
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 I had to be used by God in my life.

612
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Finally,

613
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 I don't know if you have ever thought about

614
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 whether the action I chose

615
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 was in line with God's plan.

616
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 But this is what the Philippians encouraged me to do.

617
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 They said,

618
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 "For you have made your decisions

619
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 according to your own will

620
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 in order to accomplish His will."

621
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 We make decisions

622
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 not because we think we are great,

623
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 but because we want to accomplish God's will.

624
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 What we have to do is to surrender,

625
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 to surrender to God's will,

626
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 and then act,

627
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 and to show the way of life.

628
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 So I have a hope for you,

629
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 that you will use your youth well.

630
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 You don't have to go on a mission.

631
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 This place,

632
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 this community,

633
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 has many needs.

634
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 Your family, your friends,

635
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 have many needs.

636
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Can you devote your youth

637
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 to God's use?

638
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 And if you are willing,

639
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 you can also trust and obey,

640
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 to show the way of life.

641
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 I will give the floor to Pastor Ari.

642
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Thank you, Cody.

643
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Thank you, Lord.

644
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Cody is now studying at the Bordeaux Synagogue.

645
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Studying the Bible is not just

646
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 because I want to study the Bible.

647
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Studying the Bible requires

648
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 some kind of evidence,

649
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 and the call of God.

650
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Then you can read it.

651
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 We have some practical students,

652
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 if you really want to study the Bible,

653
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 you can talk to them,

654
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 why they suddenly want to study the Bible,

655
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 and devote their youth to study it.

656
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 After hearing them talk about

657
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 the call of God and their story,

658
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 I also want to tell you,

659
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 behind KFCC,

660
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 behind this care center,

661
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 there is one very important thing,

662
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 through the sisters who serve,

663
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 including you,

664
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 to spread the gospel,

665
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 and the last step,

666
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 is to establish the first

667
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 church in Hong Kong.

668
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 May God continue to help us,

669
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 and may we serve the local people

670
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 in a good way.

671
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 I think today we have two witnesses,

672
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 and it's almost time,

673
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 we may not be able to sing the response song.

674
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 So, Pastor Karen,

675
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 please pray with us.

676
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Let's pray together.

677
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Dear God,

678
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 when we talk about the transformation of life this year,

679
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 can we live out of the outside world?

680
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 It's a litmus test to see if our lives have changed.

681
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Dear God,

682
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 I pray that you will help us.

683
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Actually, there are many opportunities

684
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 around us.

685
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 God, you didn't call us to go very far,

686
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 but there are many people nearby

687
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 who need you,

688
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 and who need the response.

689
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 God, I pray that you will remind us again

690
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 how our lives have been touched by you.

691
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 How much you love us,

692
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 how you have saved us,

693
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 how you have guided us.

694
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 God, how can we bring this love

695
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 from you to the people around us?

696
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 God, we may have to pay a price

697
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 to be with you.

698
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 But God, when we think of you

699
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 being born on the cross for us,

700
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 shedding blood for us,

701
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 so that we can share this love with you,

702
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 we know in our hearts

703
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 that all the costs are worth it.

704
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 God, I pray that you give us courage

705
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 and let us put down our fear

706
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 to answer you,

707
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 to respond to your call.

708
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 God, let our lives

709
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 not only be for ourselves,

710
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 but also for you.

711
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 May our lives be transformed by you,

712
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 and may it be a life that honors you

713
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 and also blesses others.

714
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 God, I pray that you continue

715
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 to lead us on the path ahead.

716
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Help us to live a life

717
