1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (audience applauding)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,460
 - It's so good to be back with you guys.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,660
 And as you know, I was in Singapore.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,460
 And for the beginning, I was with Pastor John

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,460
 at Movement Day Conference.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,160
 Have anybody heard of Movement Day?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,000
 Raise your hand.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,840
 Yes, several of you.

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,700
 And we got to see what God was doing

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,500
 in different cities in Southeast Asia.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,500
 So in Jakarta, in India, half the conference was Indian.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
 They're really into Movement Day.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 Jakarta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Pastor John,

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
 Pastor Andrew Gardner was there.

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,500
 And they were talking about how they were reaching

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
 the next generation.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
 And it was an awesome time at Movement Day Conference

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 in Singapore.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 And then we also had a conference with Winnie

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
 and the Explorer pastors, the Explorer team there.

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
 And we went to Heart of God Church

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 and just seeing how they do youth ministry.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 This church is full of thousands of young people

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 and young people from six or seven are taking photos.

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 People, teens from 14 to 15 are starting

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 to lead other Connect group leaders.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
 And it's amazing to see this youth church

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 and really learn from them and see how we can grow also

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
 as a church to grow our youth and help them to grow.

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 Well, while I was in Singapore,

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 who's been to Singapore before?

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
 Who's been to Singapore?

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
 There's a lot of you.

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 There's a lot of churches there as well.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
 And we're talking about First Corinthians,

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 which is also another very important church.

37
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 And while I was there, we heard a couple talks about this.

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 And I also was having conversations

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
 with different Christians who were in Singapore.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 And a big topic that came up was different scandals

41
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 that came into the church.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 And one of the biggest scandals that happened in the church,

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 as you see in the next slide, was City Harvest Church.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 City Harvest Church is one of the biggest churches

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 in Singapore or was, I think they had like 10,000 people

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 or something like that.

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 And what happened was the senior pastor,

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 his name was Kong He, he had a wife that was a singer, okay?

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 Or who was becoming a singer or something like that.

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
 And there was some sort of scandal where he took money

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 from the church and he tried to use it to support his wife

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
 in her singing career.

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 And that blew up, right?

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 And not only was the senior pastor involved,

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 you see all these others were also involved, right?

56
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
 Not only was a senior pastor involved,

57
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 another founding member was involved,

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 the secretary of the church, board members,

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 financial people in the church were also involved

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 and they were all convicted.

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 And so this church was struggling

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
 because of their leadership.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 Their leadership was struggling with greed

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 and mishandling of money.

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
 And I was also talking with other people

66
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 and some of them went to another church,

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 I think it's called New Creation Church,

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
 as you see in the next slide, Joseph Prince,

69
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 anybody heard of Joseph Prince?

70
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 And he has a lot of people at his churches

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 with a lot of different locations.

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 And I was talking with one of the people

73
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 that went to the church and he was saying,

74
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 "Oh yeah, this church, it's very interesting.

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 "It's very rich, they have their own mega mall building."

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 They own the mall, right?

77
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 "Very rich, they invite Hillsong

78
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 "and the biggest stars to come."

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 But they're like, "Ah, his message,

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 "a little bit suspicious at times,

81
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 "a little bit too much prosperity

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
 "and not talking about sin,

83
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 "focusing on grace and blessing,

84
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
 "but doesn't talk about really

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
 "that we need to repent and confess."

86
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 And so this church, it's doing well,

87
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 but there's also problems.

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,500
 And this is a theological issue within the church.

89
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 As we're talking about the Corinthian Church,

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 it also had its own problems.

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 And I identified three problems

92
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 that were really big in the Corinthian Church.

93
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 And the first one is individualism.

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 The second is idolatry.

95
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 And the third is immorality, immorality.

96
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
 And I've actually been to Corinth.

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 Has anybody been to Corinth?

98
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,500
 As you see in the next slide, I've been to Corinth.

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 This is my photo, I didn't take it from the internet.

100
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 And it's a lovely place.

101
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 There's a lot of rocks on top of a lot of other rocks.

102
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 And some of these rocks have been shaped

103
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 and it's quite beautiful.

104
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 But when you go to a lot of these ruins,

105
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 former cities, Ephesus,

106
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,500
 at least, Leoludicea, Philadelphia,

107
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 you know, there's a lot of rocks.

108
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 But if you just look at rocks, there's no meaning, right?

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 You gotta sort of understand, oh, this was where

110
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 the temple was, oh, this was where the main street was.

111
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 And so, Pastor Michelle did a introduction.

112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 I'm just gonna do a brief understanding

113
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 of where Corinth was.

114
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,500
 As you see in the next slide, Corinth was in,

115
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
 it's in modern day Greece, right?

116
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 And it's in between two pieces of land.

117
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 It's called the isthmus, right?

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 The upper part and the lower part of Greece.

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 And it's also separated by two ports,

120
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 two bodies of water.

121
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
 As you see in the next slide,

122
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
 ships would come in from one side,

123
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
 you know, from Israel, from Egypt,

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 they would deliver different trades.

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 And where do you think they were going?

126
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
 Where do you think they were going?

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 To modern day Rome, right?

128
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 Rome was the capital.

129
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 And so, it was dangerous to go around.

130
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 It was dangerous to go around

131
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 because there were many storms.

132
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
 And so, what people usually did,

133
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 what ships would usually do,

134
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 is they would go from Egypt or Israel or wherever

135
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 towards Corinth, and then they would drag their boat

136
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
 over to the other side.

137
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 It's around four miles.

138
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 Or they would drag all their, you know,

139
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 the things they were carrying to the other side

140
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 and transport it to another ship

141
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 so that that ship would go to Rome instead.

142
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 And so, because it became a port city,

143
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 it became very wealthy.

144
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
 It charged a lot, you know, for people to stay there.

145
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
 And if boats were going around

146
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 and the crew was, some of the crew or the merchandise

147
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 was staying in Corinth,

148
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
 you would charge money there, right?

149
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
 It was charging taxes and money for people coming in

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 and out of their ports.

151
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 It was big on trade.

152
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 A lot of people from different kinds of backgrounds

153
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 were coming.

154
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 It was a cosmological, not cosmological,

155
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 cosmetologen, is it comatol?

156
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
 Cosmopolitan, sorry.

157
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
 Sorry, my bad.

158
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 Yeah, it was that kind of city.

159
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 And it became very wealthy.

160
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 It became very wealthy.

161
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,500
 And it was only years later that, you know,

162
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 some people, some of the rulers there

163
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 dug out a canal, as you see in the next photo,

164
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 dug out a canal for the boats to go over

165
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 so that ships could pass more easily.

166
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 Another reason that Corinth became very rich

167
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 was the Isthmian Games, Isthmian Games.

168
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 Now, the World Cup is coming out.

169
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 You know, that's very popular.

170
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 The Olympics is very popular.

171
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 The Olympics was more popular than the Isthmian Games.

172
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 The Isthmian Games happened every other year,

173
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 similar to the games in the Olympics.

174
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 You know, I think back then they did wrestling and javelin.

175
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 They also did other things, like singing competitions

176
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 or I think dramas as well, something like that.

177
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 So the Isthmian Games would be like our modern day,

178
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 you know, the Asian Games or something like that,

179
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 you know, prep games to prep people

180
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 for the Olympic Games.

181
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 And so if people came for these games,

182
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 they would need places to stay.

183
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 They would spend money, right?

184
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 If people came and delivered their goods

185
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 and their goods were passing through,

186
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 people, boatmen, would need to stay.

187
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 And so that is why the city became more and more wealthy.

188
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
 And the people in the church,

189
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 some of them became more and more wealthy.

190
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 And so individualism started to become a problem.

191
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 And what do I mean by individualism?

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 It's more like, oh, I am of a certain class.

193
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
 I'm of a certain standard.

194
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 And if you don't meet that standard,

195
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 well then, you know, you're not really in my crew, right?

196
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 And that causes divisions.

197
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 And we see that in 1 Corinthians 1.

198
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 And it says here, let's read together, one, two, three.

199
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,500
 I appeal to you, brothers and sisters.

200
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 [INAUDIBLE]

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 [INAUDIBLE]

202
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
 So Paul starts this letter in chapter one,

203
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 informing them that he's heard

204
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 that there are people who say, I follow this person.

205
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 I follow Paul. I follow Peter. I follow Apollo, right?

206
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 I follow Christ.

207
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
 And that was because also that society,

208
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 back then in Roman society,

209
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 you were either a free or a slave, free or slave.

210
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 As you see in the next slide,

211
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 there were different classes of people.

212
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 There was the upper class, right?

213
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 The emperors, the senators, the aristocrats,

214
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 you know, those who could work,

215
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 and those who were of the lower class,

216
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 foreigners, slaves, gladiators.

217
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
 They were of a different class.

218
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 It was a big segregation in the Roman culture.

219
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 And because of that,

220
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 a lot of the people also incorporated that into their church.

221
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 And so they started separating themselves

222
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 from each other, right?

223
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
 Oh, I follow Paul. Paul's done this.

224
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 He started churches here, here, here.

225
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 My Paul is better than your Peter, right?

226
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 And that became a problem.

227
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 They were quarreling.

228
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 And Paul continues here,

229
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
 and he says in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

230
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 you are still worldly,

231
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 for since there is jealousy and quarreling among you,

232
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
 are you not worldly?

233
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 Are you not acting like mere humans?

234
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
 For the one says, I follow Paul, I follow Apollos.

235
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 Paul was saying, I fed you first with milk,

236
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 but now you are older,

237
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
 and you should be eating solid food.

238
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 But now you are still worldly.

239
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 You are still immature,

240
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 because there's quarreling and jealousy among you.

241
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 This church was young.

242
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 It was only around three years old,

243
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 according to some of the commentators.

244
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
 All right, so young Christians, right?

245
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 A lot of them are,

246
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 probably all of them are first generation Christians, right?

247
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 And they grew up with this culture,

248
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 being in the Roman culture of individualism, of classes.

249
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 And so that started to flow within the churches.

250
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 And Paul's response to this was, what did he say?

251
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 He says this,

252
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 "Only servants though, who you came to believe."

253
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 These people are only servants who you came to believe.

254
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 "As the Lord has assigned each of them to you, to his task.

255
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it,

256
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 "but God has made it grow."

257
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 Why are you making a big deal of who you are following?

258
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 All these people, Paul, Peter, Apollo,

259
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
 they're all just servants of the Lord.

260
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 All of them are just teaching about Jesus Christ ultimately,

261
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 who you are ultimately following.

262
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,500
 God has assigned these servants to help you to grow.

263
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 We should not be focusing on the servants,

264
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
 but on Jesus Christ himself.

265
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 This was the first sign of quarreling

266
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
 and individualism and division within the church.

267
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 The second place that we see this

268
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 is in the next passage that we read in chapter 11.

269
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 Let's read this together, one, two, three.

270
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 In the first place.

271
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 (congregation chattering)

272
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 "No doubt there have to be differences among you

273
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
 "to show which of you have God's approval.

274
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 "So then, when you come together,

275
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
 "it is not the Lord's Supper you eat.

276
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 "For when you are eating, some of you go ahead

277
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
 "with your own private suppers.

278
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 "As a result, one person remains hungry

279
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 "and another gets drunk.

280
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 "So then, my brothers, sisters,

281
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 "when you gather to eat, you should all eat together.

282
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 "Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home

283
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 "so that when you meet together,

284
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 "it may not result in judgment."

285
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 Who's been to a potluck before?

286
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 When you go to a potluck, what is the thinking process?

287
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 You think about what to bring, right?

288
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 Now, some of you, okay, let's admit it, right?

289
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
 Who are you, who of you are very generous

290
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 and are gonna bring more?

291
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 Raise your hand.

292
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 Yeah, Charles, yeah, good, Anthony.

293
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 Okay, who is very stingy and they'll be like,

294
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 "I'm just gonna bring the least that I can to get by."

295
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 Who wants to admit it?

296
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 Nobody wants to admit it, eh?

297
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 These are the people, me?

298
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
 (laughing)

299
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 I think Paul is saying anyone who is hungry

300
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 should eat at home first.

301
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
 So I think he was talking to me.

302
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 So I'll eat before I come to your next

303
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 home invited dinners, okay?

304
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 Okay, I'm sorry, forgive me.

305
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 (laughing)

306
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 So when you go to a potluck,

307
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 you think about, oh, who's hosting, right?

308
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
 If it is Agnes and Vincent hosting,

309
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 oh, I know they're generous.

310
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
 They're gonna make lots of portions.

311
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 Maybe I'll just bring something small, right?

312
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 Maybe that's what you're thinking.

313
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 Okay, maybe you're like Auntie Jackie as well.

314
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 I like to cook up something as well

315
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
 or get my helper to cook up something.

316
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,500
 Okay, you cook, okay, sorry, you cook.

317
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 And so she's gonna bring a lot of food as well, right?

318
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 But there's those who are very stingy, right?

319
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 That who don't bring anything, right?

320
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 And so it causes some sort of division

321
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 or quarreling amongst them.

322
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
 Now back then, they would mix some of these dinners

323
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,500
 with their pagan dinners or banquets, right?

324
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 That's why Paul is saying,

325
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 some of you are getting drunk, right?

326
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 Can you imagine, you know, having a Christmas party

327
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 at church and people are getting drunk?

328
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
 You know, that would not happen here, right?

329
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 But back then in the church,

330
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
 they had the Lord's Supper and that was combined

331
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 with some of the dinners that they were having

332
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 and banquets that they were having

333
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
 and a lot of them were pagan

334
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
 and a lot of them would get drunk

335
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 because they were sort of still young believers.

336
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
 And so what was happening was there were rich people

337
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 and those who were getting richer

338
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 'cause it was a port city, right?

339
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 A wealthy city, a lot of trade.

340
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 Some of them were getting wealthier and wealthier

341
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 and they were starting to segregate themselves

342
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 from those who were poor.

343
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 Maybe the wealthy were like,

344
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 oh, we're gonna have our own dinner here.

345
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 This is the wealthy dinner.

346
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 And for those who are less wealthy,

347
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 maybe they can just share among themselves.

348
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 And that caused what Paul said was divisions among you.

349
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 Divisions among you.

350
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,500
 And food can be a sensitive topic at church.

351
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 Food can be sensitive topic sometimes.

352
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 Well, maybe not for Auntie Jackie.

353
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 She's giving a little bit.

354
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 Sometimes food can be a sensitive topic, all right?

355
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 And so it was at this church as well.

356
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 For example, if we have Alpha, right?

357
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
 And we used to have Alpha dinners.

358
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 This was before COVID and we would have

359
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,500
 just all these foods lined up, right?

360
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
 And some people would take plates full of food, right?

361
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 A mountain full of food, right?

362
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 Have you ever met anybody like that?

363
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
 They would take a mountain of food, right?

364
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 And it was not me.

365
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
 It was not me, okay?

366
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 I'm not condemning myself.

367
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 It was not me.

368
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 So, you know, food was a sensitive topic.

369
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 So we're like, hey, we know that you can be very hungry,

370
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 that maybe you can save some food and then afterwards,

371
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 once everybody's gotten enough food,

372
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 then you can take your share, right?

373
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 Food can be a sensitive topic.

374
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 You know, I've been here, literally been here.

375
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 And so what about us?

376
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 You know, back then, individualism, classes

377
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 were a big thing, wealthy and the rich.

378
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 Back then, Jews and Gentiles, wise and fools,

379
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 noble birth and not noble birth, that was a big thing.

380
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
 What about us at our church?

381
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 You know, sometimes I hear the Explorer kids,

382
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 they're like, oh, he goes to this school, you know,

383
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 it's a really good school, right?

384
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 Or, oh, they just go to local school, right?

385
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
 Sometimes we talk about it, right?

386
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
 We talk about it, but, you know,

387
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 it doesn't mean that in our Explorer groups,

388
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 it doesn't mean we segregate people.

389
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 Oh, they go to bad schools.

390
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 Don't, don't, don't let them have their own group.

391
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 We don't do that, we don't do that.

392
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 We're one body of Christ.

393
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
 Yes, you know, we'll have some downfalls

394
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
 and mistakes here and there,

395
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 but for the most part, we are showing unity.

396
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 It doesn't matter what school you go to.

397
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 It could be a very expensive school,

398
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 it could be a free school,

399
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 we still accept you in Explorer, right, Winnie?

400
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,500
 Yes, of course, okay, very enthusiastically.

401
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 So individualism, the different classes,

402
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 led to division.

403
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 And what was Paul's response?

404
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 Well, we see that Paul's response was,

405
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 don't follow the leader.

406
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 Don't only just follow the leader,

407
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 follow the Lord, right?

408
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
 The Lord is ultimately the person

409
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 who has placed those leaders to help you to grow

410
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 in your church.

411
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 And so don't focus on Peter, Paul, Apollo.

412
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 Focus only on what God has done.

413
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 In Ephesians chapter two, it says this,

414
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 "But now in Christ, you who were once far away

415
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 "have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

416
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 "For he himself is our peace,

417
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
 "who has made the two groups one,

418
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 "and has destroyed the barrier,

419
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 "dividing the wall of hostility."

420
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 Christ died for us.

421
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 There's no longer Jew or Gentile,

422
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 but we are one body, family of Christ.

423
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 Jesus has brought unity through the cross.

424
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 And so that was his message to the Corinthian church.

425
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 And it's a message to us today.

426
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 Yes, you know, we're known to be a rich church, right?

427
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 For some of you who didn't know.

428
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
 (congregation laughing)

429
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 We're known, or our reputation is,

430
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 oh, there might be a lot of people of high positions

431
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 in this church as well.

432
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 Yes.

433
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 But I don't see us dividing, you know, fellowships.

434
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
 Are we dividing fellowships?

435
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
 Oh, this is the low paying grade fellowship.

436
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
 This is the high paying grade.

437
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 We don't do that.

438
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 We don't do that because we believe in this,

439
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,500
 that Jesus has brought unity through the cross.

440
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 And ultimately the money comes from who anyways?

441
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 Comes from God.

442
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 It comes, it goes, blessed be the name of the Lord.

443
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 So individualism was the first thing that they faced,

444
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
 first problem that they faced.

445
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 The second problem that they faced was idolatry.

446
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 Idolatry.

447
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 Corinth became a hub for religious activity as well, okay?

448
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
 Religious activity from all over the world.

449
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 And especially they had different temples

450
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
 to different Greek and Roman gods.

451
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 Aphrodite is the God of love.

452
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,500
 Poseidon, they especially focused on Poseidon as well

453
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 because he was the God of the sea.

454
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 And so because Corinth was between two seaports,

455
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 they especially focused and paid tribute to Poseidon.

456
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 Apollos was the God of a lot of things.

457
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
 Hermes, Venus.

458
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 And you remember the God, the statue to worship

459
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 the gods who are unknown or all the gods?

460
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
 It was also here in Corinth.

461
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 Let's read chapter 10 together.

462
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 One, two, three.

463
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,

464
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 that our fathers were all under the cloud

465
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 and all passed through the sea

466
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea

467
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 and all ate the same spiritual food

468
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 and all drank from the same spiritual drink.

469
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them

470
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
 and the rock was Christ.

471
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
 Nevertheless, the most of the God was not pleased

472
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

473
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
 Verse six.

474
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 Now these things took place as an example for us

475
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 that we might not desire evil as they did.

476
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 Do not be idolaters as some of them were.

477
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 As it is written,

478
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.

479
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 We should not commit sexual immorality

480
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 as some of them did.

481
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 And in the day, 23,000 of them died.

482
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 We should not, Christ, for some of them did

483
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 and were killed by snakes.

484
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 Therefore, my beloved, flee idolatry.

485
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 All right.

486
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 What is Paul talking about here in chapter 10?

487
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
 He's talking about the Israelites.

488
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 The Israelites fled and had the Exodus

489
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 from Egypt.

490
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 And as you see in the next slide,

491
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 after they crossed the Red Sea,

492
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 God sent what?

493
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,500
 God sent by day the cloud, the pillar of cloud, right?

494
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 Because in the desert, is there any shade in the desert?

495
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 Not much desert.

496
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 Has anybody been to a desert before?

497
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 Yeah, one person.

498
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 Two, thank you.

499
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 Three, okay.

500
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 In the desert, there's no trees, right?

501
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 And so what, and it can get very hot, right?

502
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 If the sun is burning.

503
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 And so God sent a pillar of cloud by the day.

504
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
 So nice of the Lord, right?

505
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 And at night, has anybody been to the desert at night?

506
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
 Yeah, how was it at night?

507
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 It was dark, it was cold, right?

508
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 And so God gave a pillar of fire at night.

509
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 Wow, they could warm up.

510
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 They could see where they're going.

511
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 God is so good.

512
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,500
 God provided everything they needed.

513
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 God provided what from the sky for them to eat.

514
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 What did they provide?

515
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 Manna, bread from heaven, right?

516
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 But the problem was, in verse six, Paul says this,

517
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
 "Now these things took place as an example for us,

518
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,500
 "that we might not desire evil as they did

519
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 "or lust as they did."

520
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,500
 What did Israel lust after?

521
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 God took care of all of them.

522
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 Provided cloud, provided the fire.

523
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 God provided manna, but what, they were not satisfied.

524
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 What did they want?

525
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 They wanted meat.

526
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 Who's a meat lover here?

527
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
 Yeah, you guys are all guilty, I'm joking.

528
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
 (audience laughing)

529
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 God provided quail, I think it was quail, for them.

530
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 And it flew around them and they could just eat it, right?

531
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,500
 They were not satisfied with what the Lord had given them.

532
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 They lusted after meat.

533
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
 And not only did they lust after meat, what did they do?

534
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 They had a golden calf, right?

535
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 They wanted something physical.

536
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 Oh, we haven't seen God for days.

537
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
 Oh, we haven't seen Moses for days.

538
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 I don't know where they are.

539
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 They're up in Mount Sinai, worshiping God.

540
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 We can't see them anymore.

541
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,500
 We want something that we could physically see and worship,

542
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 just like the other nations.

543
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,500
 And they had a golden calf and they worshiped it.

544
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 And that's why Paul quotes here,

545
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 "The people sat down and eat and drank and rose up to play."

546
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 They started to incorporate idolatry into their worship.

547
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:51,500
 The Corinthian church was also dealing with idolatry

548
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
 and they were also dealing with meat.

549
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
 Where would they get their meat?

550
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 A lot of them got their meat sacrificed to idols, okay?

551
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
 They ate meat that were sacrificed to idols

552
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 and Paul specifically spends some chapters

553
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 to talk about this, how it is affecting their faith,

554
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,500
 affecting their church.

555
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 And so we see a comparison between Israel and Corinth.

556
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 God provided manna and deliverance for Israel.

557
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,500
 God also provided wealth and prosperity

558
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,500
 for the city in Corinth and this church was also prospering.

559
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 Israel drank from the rock, which is Jesus Christ.

560
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 Corinth has been saved by the rock of salvation, Jesus Christ.

561
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 The problem with Israel was they lusted after flesh,

562
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,500
 meat, fleshly desires.

563
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 Corinth also desired meat sacrificed to idols.

564
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 They fell into idolatry. Israel fell into idolatry.

565
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 Corinth was falling into idolatry.

566
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 They were incorporating the different gods

567
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 and the different worships of those gods into the church

568
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 and meat sacrificed to idols was being eaten

569
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 by some of them in the church as well.

570
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,500
 They mixed idolatry into God's worship

571
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 and ultimately there was punishment.

572
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 Idolatry leads ultimately to death, spiritual death.

573
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 And God punished them.

574
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
 How many did he say died in the desert?

575
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 23,000 of them died.

576
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 How come?

577
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 They were blessed by God.

578
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 God provided for them.

579
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
 How come they died?

580
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 Because they did not obey the Lord.

581
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 They followed their flesh.

582
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 They followed idols.

583
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 And that was Paul's warning to the church in Corinth.

584
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
 God has blessed you.

585
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 God has blessed this city.

586
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 But you must be careful to flee from idolatry

587
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 because idolatry will lead to spiritual death.

588
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
 What about us?

589
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
 What about us?

590
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,500
 What are some of the idols that are in Hong Kong?

591
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 Big idols?

592
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 Money?

593
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,500
 Mirror? Oh, mirror.

594
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
 Yeah, mirror. Yeah.

595
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 We won't be singing mirror.

596
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 I don't think our worship team will be singing mirror anytime soon.

597
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,500
 Greed is a big one.

598
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 Okay, Rolex, we're getting very specific.

599
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 Rolex.

600
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 It's not wrong to buy a Rolex.

601
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 But okay, in general, greed, money, right?

602
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 Fame or status, right?

603
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 These things are very big idols in our city.

604
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:23,500
 And so we must be careful not to make these things

605
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,500
 idols in our lives and also in our churches.

606
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
 And so that is a warning to us.

607
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
 And I looked up some things.

608
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:39,500
 One commentary had this, "Signs our church has fallen to the world.

609
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,500
 "Teaching the Bible is not inspired and inerrant."

610
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,500
 Do we teach that the Bible is not inspired and inerrant?

611
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
 Do we teach that?

612
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 No, we don't. No, we don't.

613
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
 Somebody might have been confused.

614
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
 Okay?

615
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,500
 A sign that a church has fallen is that we start teaching

616
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 that there is more than one way to God besides Jesus.

617
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,500
 Do we teach that there is more than one way?

618
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 No, we don't.

619
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 There's only one way.

620
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 The way, the truth, and the life.

621
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,500
 And He is Jesus.

622
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 Being embarrassed to say that Jesus is the only way to salvation.

623
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
 Are we embarrassed?

624
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
 No, we are not embarrassed.

625
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,500
 Teaching that there's no absolute right or wrong.

626
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,500
 Does our church say that there's no absolute right or wrong?

627
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
 If you feel it's okay for you, then it's okay for you.

628
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 Do we teach that?

629
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
 We do not.

630
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 We believe that the moral compass is God.

631
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,500
 And He has taught us through the Bible.

632
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 He teaches us through the Bible what is absolutely right and wrong.

633
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 He is the moral law maker.

634
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 Condemning the society of sins.

635
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 Condemning the society of sins.

636
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 Not condemning the society of sins.

637
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 Is another sign that the church has fallen to the world.

638
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 I think we're okay.

639
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,500
 Let's stay strong and focused on the Lord.

640
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
 Individualism.

641
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
 Idolatry.

642
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 And the third thing that this church was facing was immorality.

643
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
 Sexual immorality.

644
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 Now, as you see the next slide, the temple of love, of Aphrodite's,

645
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,500
 was actually on the mountain.

646
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 So Corinth was split into two.

647
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 Sort of two places, right?

648
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
 There was Corinth, the main city here.

649
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 And then there was the Acro-Corinth, which is the upper Corinth.

650
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
 And if the city was attacked, they could easily abandon the city

651
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,500
 and flee to the mountains where it was safer and easier to defend.

652
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,500
 And on top of the mountain, well, on top of the mountain,

653
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 there was a temple of Aphrodite's.

654
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 And that was the temple of, do you guys know?

655
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
 Of love, okay?

656
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 And it was said that there was over a thousand prostitutes

657
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:14,500
 where you could go and pay tribute and offer yourselves to this God.

658
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,500
 And so the word Corinthentize, I'm sorry, I'm saying it wrong,

659
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 but it became synonymous with sexual immorality.

660
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,500
 This city became the Las Vegas of its day.

661
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,500
 What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?

662
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 You don't say this about Ocean Park, right?

663
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,500
 I hope not.

664
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,500
 Corinth became a center for sexual immorality.

665
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 People, especially who were traveling, had nothing to do,

666
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
 didn't have to go home, didn't have responsibilities.

667
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,500
 They were free. Let's have night of fun and party.

668
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
 Let's go meet some people.

669
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 And these prostitutes, it was said that they would come down

670
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,500
 at night from the temple into the city to seek people

671
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,500
 who wanted to also pay tribute.

672
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,500
 Corinthian church was also dealing with this.

673
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
 Let's read together chapter six.

674
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
 We'll read some of it.

675
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
 One, two, three.

676
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
 "No, you yourselves."

677
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:39,500
 [audience talking]

678
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,500
 "Adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves,

679
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,500
 nor coveters, nor drunkards, nor revealers, nor extortioners

680
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,500
 will inherit the kingdom of God.

681
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,500
 And such were some of you, but you were washed,

682
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,500
 but you were sanctified, but you were justified

683
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,500
 in the name of the Lord Jesus, in the spirit of God."

684
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,500
 Some of them thought, "Oh, I've been cleansed in the inside

685
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
 by the Lord Jesus.

686
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 So the things I commit outside the body, it doesn't matter."

687
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
 That was some of the thinking.

688
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,500
 And Paul says that in chapter six.

689
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
 The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality,

690
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
 but for the Lord.

691
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,500
 Sexual immorality, the definition of that

692
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,500
 is sex outside of marriage.

693
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,500
 God has gifted humanity with sex,

694
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
 but within the confines of marriage.

695
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,500
 And anything outside of that is sexual immorality.

696
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 And so the Corinthians were sometimes thinking this.

697
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 "Oh, I've been saved, my inner self.

698
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 You know, God has saved my soul.

699
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 That's all that matters.

700
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
 The things I commit on the outside of my body,

701
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
 it doesn't matter."

702
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,500
 No, Paul says, your body is the temple of God.

703
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:09,500
 When you do these things to your body, it defiles your body.

704
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 You become impure.

705
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,500
 And so immorality, sexual immorality,

706
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,500
 leads to defilement, leads to defilement.

707
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,500
 And this was one of the things

708
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,500
 that the Corinthian church dealt with,

709
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,500
 because that was their culture.

710
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
 It was a big thing back then.

711
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,500
 And so what about us?

712
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,500
 Maybe we have impurity of our speech.

713
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
 Maybe we're gossiping,

714
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,500
 maybe we're talking down on people.

715
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
 Maybe we have impurity of conduct.

716
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
 We don't show love.

717
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,500
 Instead, we're showing hatred.

718
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,500
 Maybe in our secret life,

719
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,500
 we're falling into sexual immorality.

720
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500
 And thank God,

721
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,500
 our church does not practise sexual immorality at church.

722
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
 I think that's some of the things

723
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
 that they were dealing with.

724
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,500
 Some of the brothers in the church,

725
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,500
 some of them married their father's wife.

726
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,500
 That was something that Paul specifically mentioned.

727
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,500
 Don't associate with these people, right?

728
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
 We need to rebuke them.

729
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
 And if they confess,

730
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,500
 help them to be restored in the faith.

731
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,500
 And so what about us?

732
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,500
 Maybe we have impurities of different kinds.

733
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
 It could be in our speech,

734
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
 it could be in our conduct,

735
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
 it could be in our private life.

736
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,500
 We need Jesus to cleanse us on a daily basis.

737
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
 So let's recap here.

738
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
 The first thing that they faced,

739
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,500
 individualism led to division in this church.

740
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
 Idolatry led to spiritual death,

741
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,500
 led them towards physical death and punishment as well

742
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
 from the Lord.

743
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
 Immorality leads to defilement.

744
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,500
 And what is the solution to this?

745
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,500
 Jesus is the solution.

746
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,500
 Jesus died for all of us.

747
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,500
 Jews, Gentiles, wealthy, poor, right?

748
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,500
 High positions, lowly positions.

749
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
 God has died for all of us.

750
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:51,500
 We are all joined together by the blood of Christ.

751
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
 The answer to idolatry

752
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
 is to let go of our idols

753
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
 and recognize that only Jesus saves.

754
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,500
 Our money is not going to save us.

755
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:11,500
 Going after relationship to relationship to relationship

756
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
 is not going to save us ultimately.

757
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,500
 Ultimately, it's a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ

758
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
 that saves us.

759
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,500
 Looking after status and looking good on the outside

760
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
 is not going to save us.

761
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,500
 Eventually, our bodies are gonna be old and wear away.

762
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,500
 Only Jesus saves.

763
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,500
 And the last thing is Jesus purifies.

764
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
 Jesus purifies.

765
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,500
 We need Jesus to purify our lips,

766
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
 the things that we talk about.

767
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,500
 We need Jesus to purify our actions.

768
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
 We need Jesus.

769
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,500
 We need Jesus to purify our minds.

770
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
 Humility.

771
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,500
 I have three H's to help us today as a church.

772
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
 Humility.

773
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,500
 We need to be humble like Jesus.

774
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
 How was Jesus humble?

775
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:18,500
 He left his throne in heaven to be with us, to be with you.

776
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,500
 He left his throne to be with us.

777
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,500
 Jesus was humble.

778
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,500
 The second thing we need to do is halt, stop.

779
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,500
 Stop the things that we're doing that are not pleasing to the Lord.

780
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,500
 What is becoming an idol in your life?

781
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
 Is it a person?

782
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
 Is it wealth?

783
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,500
 What is it?

784
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,500
 Sometimes it could be good things too, right?

785
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
 But if you start idolizing those good things,

786
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
 it's not a good thing.

787
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,500
 It becomes something of an idol.

788
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,500
 So we must be careful.

789
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
 The last thing is holiness.

790
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,500
 Be holy for our Lord is holy.

791
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,500
 Holy is being set apart from the world.

792
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,500
 The Lord wants our church to be humble.

793
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,500
 To stop any idols that come in our church

794
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,500
 and to be holy and pleasing to the Lord.

795
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
 We need Jesus.

796
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,500
 Let's just take a moment right now as the band comes up

797
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:45,500
 just to come before the Lord in repentance.

798
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,500
 What are some of the things that the Lord places on our heart

799
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,500
 that we've fallen short of the Lord?

800
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,500
 Maybe it's our speech.

801
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
 Our speech has been impure.

802
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
 Maybe it's our thoughts.

803
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,500
 Maybe we've looked down on others.

804
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,500
 And these things can affect our church as well.

805
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,500
 Let us flee from sin, flee from immorality,

806
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:22,500
 flee from idolatry, flee from the divisions

807
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,500
 caused by individualism.

808
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,500
 Let us take some time to repent before the Lord now and confess.

809
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:40,500
 And after a minute we will rise and respond in song.

810
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
 Let's take that moment now.
