1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,580
 Okay, all right, let's get right to it.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,240
 So today we're going to be talking about 2 Timothy chapter 2.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,660
 The title is "Charged to Work."

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,360
 I didn't get to pick it.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,200
 James did.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:31,720
 But chapter 2 is a letter from 1,956 years ago.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,760
 So it's dated at year 65.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,240
 And it's written from Paul, I drew him, that's how I think Paul looks like.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:49,520
 Paul who is an apostle awaiting execution in Rome to his young protege Timothy, who

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
 is a young pastor in Ephesus.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,400
 And he's struggling a bit because partially there's a lot of false teachers in Ephesus.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,720
 And I also think he has some stomach problems and he's timid as mentioned in earlier chapters.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:18,300
 And so this chapter, chapter 2, is a culmination of what Paul has learned from his entire life

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,120
 and has learned throughout his years as an apostle.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,840
 And he's passing it on to Timothy because he's about to die.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,600
 2 Timothy is the last letter that Paul has written.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,280
 And he's literally awaiting execution in Rome by Emperor Nero, who's a bit of a crazy

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
 goon.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 But let me, oh, hello.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
 What?

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
 Sorry.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,960
 So I'm going to read the passage out to you.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
 He says, oh, what?

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
 The order of my slides.

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
 Okay, no slides, no slides.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:02:01,200
 "You then, my child," he says, "be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus and what

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,440
 you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men who will

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,560
 be also able to teach.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,760
 Share in suffering as a soldier of Christ.

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,240
 No soldier gets entangled with civilian pursuits since his aim is to serve the one who enlisted

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,040
 him.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,280
 An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules, and it is the hardworking

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,920
 farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,020
 Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,520
 Remember Jesus Christ risen from the dead, the offspring of David, David, David, sorry,

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,600
 a speech to my gospel for which I'm suffering, bound in chains as a criminal.

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,840
 But the word of God is not bound.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,240
 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the

39
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,720
 salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,760
 The saying is trustworthy, for if we die with him, we will also live with him.

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
 If we endure, we will also reign with him.

42
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,360
 If we deny him, he will also deny us.

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,560
 And if we are faithless, he remains faithful because he can't deny himself.

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,800
 Remind them of these things and charge them before God not to quarrel about words which

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,480
 does no good but only ruins the hearers.

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,360
 Yikes, my mom's asleep.

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:36,120
 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,940
 be ashamed of the word, rightly handling the truth.

49
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:46,080
 But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, and

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
 their talk will spread like gangrene.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,200
 Among them are Hymenaeus and Philistines who have swerved from the truth.

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,120
 They have claimed that the resurrection has already happened, and they're upsetting the

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,200
 faith of some.

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,600
 But God's firm foundation stands bearing the seal, the Lord knows those who are his, and

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,360
 let those, let everybody who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,640
 And gave his check, if I'm saying the right thing.

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,360
 Now in the great house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also clay

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,100
 and wood, some for honorable uses and some for dishonorable.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,640
 So if anybody cleanses themselves from what is dishonorable, there will be a vessel for

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,520
 honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,720
 work.

62
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,960
 So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who

63
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,800
 call on the Lord with a pure heart.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,080
 Have nothing to do with foolish and ignorant controversies.

65
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,280
 You know that they only breed quarrels.

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,800
 And let the Lord's servant not be quarrelsome, but kind to everybody.

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,440
 Will to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness.

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,480
 So that God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of truth, and they

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,160
 may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,040
 him to do his will.

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,480
 So that's the passage, and so let's pray.

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,320
 Heavenly Father God, thank you so much for this time that we can gather, Lord.

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
 You're the God of the universe.

74
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,860
 You've created the world, and it's your canvas, your people is your masterpiece, Lord.

75
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,960
 Thank you for this opportunity that I get to preach, Lord.

76
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,440
 There are so many loved ones in front of me, and because I love them so much, I really

77
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,340
 want to impress them, but Lord, deliver me from this temptation.

78
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,220
 Let this not be a showcase of intellectual gymnastics.

79
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,760
 Let this be a mighty display of how your word is alive and active, a double-edged sword

80
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,900
 pierces through hearts, Lord.

81
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,900
 Lord, I especially lift up those who have fallen away from you, or don't know you yet.

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,020
 Lord, I just pray for them that they may experience your goodness through your word, Lord.

83
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,380
 That instead of choosing themselves to be their own gods, that they will choose you.

84
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,580
 I pray all these things in your precious name, amen.

85
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,580
 Liddy, let's get to it.

86
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,020
 All right, what's it?

87
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,460
 Okay, cool.

88
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:35,100
 So this is what sin looks like, and this is the consequences of sin.

89
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,780
 And I love memes, and what I'm trying to say is that sin often looks really attractive,

90
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:52,340
 and it's very hard for us to sort of differentiate what culture is and what truth is.

91
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,860
 And so before we go through a section by section deep dive of the passage, I want us to go

92
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,340
 through, I want us to play a little game, and I want you to play this game as if your

93
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,100
 life depends on it, and it's not the squid game, but nobody's gonna die.

94
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,660
 But I just want you guys to play it seriously.

95
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,180
 So let us begin.

96
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,540
 This is Joseph Albert's interaction of color.

97
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:26,260
 All right, so all who thinks that the Xs are the same color, raise your hand.

98
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,780
 The Xs with the same color, one, two, three, four, five.

99
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,500
 And all who think it's a different color, raise your hand.

100
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,600
 Hold your hand up here.

101
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,820
 You can't tell culture from truth, because ladies and gentlemen, if you can see the bottom,

102
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
 they're connected.

103
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
 Color is relative.

104
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,220
 All right, let's play this again.

105
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,780
 All the people who got it wrong, actually, you know what?

106
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,460
 You guys can still participate.

107
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,900
 Let's continue.

108
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,420
 Raise your hand if you think it's the same color.

109
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,980
 All right, JP, two of them.

110
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,660
 Three, four, five.

111
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,700
 All right.

112
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,840
 Raise your hand if you think it's a different color.

113
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,320
 Oh, praise the Lord.

114
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,120
 Do you still think it's the same color?

115
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,840
 You still think it's the same color?

116
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
 Nah.

117
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
 They can't be more different.

118
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
 All right, last one, last one, last one.

119
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,320
 Raise your hand if you think it's the same color.

120
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,720
 All right, Clinton, JP, there's one at the back.

121
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,800
 Uncle Vincent, Anshan.

122
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
 You think it's the same color?

123
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 Oh, bless the Lord.

124
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,960
 They're the same color.

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,000
 So I don't teach art, but I love art, and I'm an artist, so hence this little exercise.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,560
 So much of our definition of things like happiness and work comes from our culture and not from

127
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,960
 the truth, which is scripture.

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,200
 And we often conflate the truth with culture, as we just saw.

129
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,720
 And so I hope this exercise illustrated to you that we must walk by faith and not by

130
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,920
 sight, because sight is very confusing.

131
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,400
 And then I want to talk about sort of confusing God's view of work and man's view of work

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,440
 before we dive into the passage.

133
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,560
 So the pinnacle of God's view of work is actually suffering.

134
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,360
 And Jesus is the best example.

135
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,120
 He died for our sins.

136
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,560
 And God can really turn nothing into something.

137
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,280
 And really what we're doing on earth right now is just rearranging the atoms that he's

138
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,840
 created.

139
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
 Nothing more than that.

140
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:49,640
 And so one of the signature moves that I think God has done is like he's able to make, what

141
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,720
 is he able to make?

142
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,280
 He's able to turn betrayal into redemption.

143
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,560
 And in Genesis, Joseph tells his brothers, "What you meant evil against me, God used

144
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,040
 it for good."

145
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,160
 And so you can think of suffering as a kind of boot camp, training, heaven prep.

146
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,840
 And then of course, in contrast to the kingdom of God, man's view of work, and the man's

147
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,400
 view of work, the pinnacle is earning, not suffering.

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,520
 Where time is not relationship, time is territory, time is money.

149
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,400
 Culture says man needs to succeed at work when they earn the most amount of money in

150
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,240
 the least amount of time.

151
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,880
 The rich deserves everything, right?

152
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,560
 From prostitutes to private jets, they deserve everything except suffering.

153
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,040
 And I think there's something seriously wrong with our world today because Hong Kong just

154
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,720
 came out of a report that says there's about 1.65 million people living in poverty in our

155
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
 city.

156
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,840
 That's about one in four of us.

157
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,880
 And then at the same time, in the US, the ultra rich just got richer.

158
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,000
 COVID made the rich 60% richer.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 That's about $1.2 trillion.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,560
 And I don't even know what that number is.

161
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,680
 And so I don't understand the economics of it, but just the way culture and work functions

162
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
 in real life is not good.

163
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,720
 Because God intended work for us to provide for his people.

164
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,960
 And we are obviously falling short of that command.

165
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,920
 So I've organized the passage into seven habits of godly workers.

166
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,280
 And there's this really fun little plug that's plugged into itself to illustrate to you that

167
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:45,080
 trying to do these things on our own is like plugging a plug into the plug outlet.

168
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:52,240
 It's obviously so stupid and so useless, yet so much of us, Christians or not, that we

169
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,160
 just try to earn our salvation and it's so terrible.

170
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,600
 So without further ado, let's get into it.

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,360
 The first thing is, Paul says to Timothy, "You then, my child, be strengthened by the

172
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,000
 grace that is in Christ Jesus.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,200
 And what you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses and trusted faithful men

174
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
 who will be able to teach also."

175
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,640
 So we got to train the trainers.

176
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,280
 And why do we need to train trainers?

177
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
 What?

178
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
 Sorry.

179
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,480
 I thought I lost the page.

180
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,160
 Thank the Lord.

181
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,080
 So he's basically saying, "Hey, kid, look, times are tough.

182
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
 He's about to get killed.

183
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,400
 Like Paul's getting killed.

184
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,600
 And then Christians are getting persecuted."

185
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,160
 So he said, "You got to be strong.

186
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,920
 You got to be strong, but don't rely on yourself like that outlet we just saw.

187
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,640
 Draw strength from Christ, strength that you don't deserve, but it's a gift from God."

188
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,840
 Another thing, don't make up stuff.

189
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,600
 Stick to what you've heard.

190
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 Don't make up stuff.

191
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
 And then go make disciples.

192
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,600
 Find faithful men, not fruitful men, not like the type A high-functioning people.

193
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:12,400
 I mean, they can be faithful too, but faithful men who will be able to teach also.

194
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,080
 That's what he's saying.

195
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:21,120
 And why this is important is because we're at church today because it was started by

196
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
 a man named Jesus.

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,040
 He made 12 disciples.

198
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,580
 And then 14 years later, there was a guy called Paul on his way to Damascus.

199
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,780
 He got converted.

200
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:41,000
 And then he met with James, who's Jesus' brother and the apostle, not an apostle.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,080
 Hold up.

202
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
 Hold up.

203
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
 Hold up.

204
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,360
 And then Paul, and then met up with Peter as well, one of the disciples.

205
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,520
 And then the rest was history.

206
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,960
 Fun fact, did you know that in 1929, there was an, I came across this Times article that's

207
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:04,080
 titled "China," capital letters, colon, "Christian Majority," which reads, "Released by the National

208
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,120
 Information Bureau in Manhattan was the striking information that seven out of 10 members of

209
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,920
 the new Nationalist Cabinet of the Republic of China are Christians."

210
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,560
 And fast forward 100 years, I read an Economist article that showed a chart that Protestant

211
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,760
 Christians are growing exponentially in China, and by 2030, China may have more Christians

212
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,400
 than the US.

213
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,560
 And why do we have that?

214
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,080
 It's because people keep on making disciples.

215
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,680
 They teach the teachers.

216
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,000
 Teachers don't come from a factory.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,440
 You teach them to be teachers.

218
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,200
 So the first thing that we ought to do is train the trainers and make disciples.

219
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
 Great.

220
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 Boop.

221
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,480
 Oh, this picture.

222
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,000
 I don't think we have time to talk about this picture, but sorry.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 It's a cool pic, though.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 All right.

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Dope.

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,080
 The second thing is that it's so comforting.

227
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,080
 Thank God that we're not called to be popular, because it's so hard, and I'm not.

228
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,120
 And we're called to be soldiers.

229
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,400
 We're called to be soldiers to wage war against the currents of culture, the seduction of

230
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
 society.

231
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,240
 He says, "Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ.

232
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,520
 No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuit since its aim is to serve the one who enlisted

233
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,400
 him."

234
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,840
 So basically, God is our commander.

235
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
 Yes.

236
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 And soldiers are part of a larger army.

237
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,880
 There is no one-person soldier.

238
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,960
 So you can't be a celebrity soldier.

239
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,480
 I can give you a hundred bucks if you can name a famous soldier.

240
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,680
 Okay, actually, no, never mind.

241
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,920
 There might be some famous soldiers.

242
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,920
 But what I'm trying to say is that we should follow the example of this king, King Jehoshaphat,

243
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,740
 which he said, "For we are powerless against this great horde that is coming against us.

244
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,440
 We do not know what to do, but our eyes are set on you."

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,240
 2 Chronicles 20, verse 12.

246
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
 And King of Judah was in face of battle.

247
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,440
 And what he chooses to do is to pray to God and set his eyes on God.

248
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,520
 And so, oh, nope, not about this slide.

249
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
 Cool.

250
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,080
 And so, right, in this passage, he talks about, he mentions the soldier, he mentions the farmer,

251
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,820
 he mentions the athlete.

252
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,860
 What I think the three of them have in common is that they're all focused on a prize, having

253
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,920
 faith that there's going to be a reward.

254
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,940
 And they are all pretty self-disciplined and hardworking because they require patience

255
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,120
 to do the same thing.

256
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,640
 Soldiers sit in the trenches to wait for the commander.

257
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,120
 Runners, I guess they just run back and forth all the time.

258
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,880
 And then farmers are obviously like, you know, weeding out the weeds.

259
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,760
 It's just like, it's just labor.

260
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,180
 And the work is not glamorous.

261
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,320
 And finally, they're obedient.

262
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,760
 So the soldier to the commander, the farmer to the laws of nature, and the runner to the

263
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,640
 rules, right?

264
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:23,520
 And God takes obedience, or rather disobedience, very seriously.

265
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,440
 If anybody remembers, when I was studying abroad, I was just so striked by how close

266
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,880
 the Red Sea or Egypt was to Jerusalem.

267
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:39,760
 And I looked on Google Maps, and it's about six days to walk from Egypt to Jerusalem.

268
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,720
 It's about a nine hour, five minute drive.

269
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,040
 Yet Moses spent 40 years there, just walking around.

270
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,360
 And of the Israelites that spent 40 years there, Joshua and Caleb were the only ones

271
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,980
 who were able to make it to the promised land from their generation, because they were the

272
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,320
 only two spies who believed that God was good enough to take them there.

273
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,040
 Not even after splitting the Red Sea.

274
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
 Crazy.

275
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,120
 Okay, the third thing is to endure.

276
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,600
 In order to enjoy, you have to endure.

277
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,160
 I think suffering is guaranteed in the Christian life.

278
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:24,160
 In 2 Timothy 3.12, it says, "All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will

279
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,000
 be persecuted."

280
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,560
 Suffering brings us closer to God through this kind of redemptive participation in the

281
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,480
 mystery of Jesus' own suffering.

282
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,000
 Yet many of us feel like suffering robs us of human value.

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
 And that's culture right there.

284
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
 You missed it.

285
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,960
 Suffering is a good test, and it reveals what our deepest values and what we've set our

286
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,120
 hopes on.

287
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,320
 So God invites us to work so that we can provide for his people that he loves, which is everyone.

288
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
 And I certainly don't love everyone.

289
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
 And so loving everyone is like suffering.

290
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,400
 But of course, what God is calling us is to a higher suffering.

291
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,160
 It's not like when your mom doesn't do the thing you want her to do, and then you're

292
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 suffering.

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
 That's not the suffering that we're talking about.

294
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
 We're talking about martyrdom.

295
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,760
 We're talking about being persecuted.

296
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:25,760
 And so one thing I really like to sort of remind myself is that, like, I love the saying

297
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,400
 no pressure, no diamonds.

298
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
 I heard it when I was in college.

299
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 Oh, nope.

300
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
 Sorry.

301
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,720
 No pressure, no diamonds.

302
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,320
 And so anybody know how diamonds are formed?

303
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 No?

304
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
 Yes?

305
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 Yes.

306
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
 All right.

307
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
 I'll tell it from...

308
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,960
 For those who don't know, it is formed in the ground, and it heats up about to 1,000

309
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
 degrees.

310
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,840
 You need about 725,000 pounds per inch of pressure to make diamonds.

311
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,880
 And so in this passage, what is the pressure?

312
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,840
 The pressure is persecution.

313
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,880
 It's suffering.

314
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
 And what are the diamonds?

315
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,600
 The diamonds are obviously the rewards that God has promised.

316
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,080
 Glory, honor, crowns, inheritance.

317
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,560
 If the earth was a first draft, and heaven is the real deal, I don't know about you,

318
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,080
 but I'm sure it would be lit.

319
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,160
 I don't know what inheritance and crowns look like, but I'm sure God would make it so cool,

320
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
 because on earth he made nudibranchs.

321
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,000
 Oh, I love these sea slugs.

322
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But just if you think about it, just bottom of the ocean, super ugly things, he made so

323
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 glorious.

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,560
 How much more would the inheritance and glory and crowns be?

325
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,440
 I bet it would be so lit.

326
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,640
 Oh, I have other illustrations.

327
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,560
 Let me check for some basil in my pocket.

328
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
 Let's go back to this side.

329
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
 Sorry.

330
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,880
 Yeah, and I wanted to quickly just show you how on earth we find all these things that

331
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,400
 point to this principle that we must endure to enjoy.

332
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,200
 Olive oil doesn't get made unless it's crushed.

333
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,440
 Wine, similarly, unless it's pressed.

334
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,280
 Basil, if you're gonna make pesto, you gotta pound it.

335
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,280
 If I wanna make you smell this, I'm not gonna just like, "Here, smell this."

336
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,920
 I would like, "Now smell this."

337
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 Oopsies.

338
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,560
 And it smells really great.

339
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,000
 And then I love the saying in Chinese.

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 There's a tea egg up here.

341
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,840
 They say, "Yan sang zheng cha yi dan, yu duo li han yu yap mei."

342
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
 And I totally agree.

343
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,440
 It says, "Life is like a tea egg.

344
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,540
 The more cracks you have, the more delicious it becomes."

345
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:49,960
 Because of course, the soy sauce stuff doesn't get marinated if there's no cracks.

346
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,280
 And so I think we need to endure to enjoy.

347
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,200
 And I just wanna quickly point out in this poem is that the implications of our work

348
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,520
 really matter.

349
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,800
 There's like a cause and effect.

350
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,440
 If we endure, we'll also reign with him.

351
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,320
 But if we deny him, he will also deny us.

352
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,480
 And earlier on, I mentioned the verse that Jesus says, "Lord, Lord, not everybody who

353
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,540
 calls on my name will enter the kingdom of God."

354
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:30,160
 And so I think it's really important that in the lightness of contemporary Christianity,

355
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,480
 I would like to remind us all to suffer a little bit more for the glory of God, such

356
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:43,600
 as helping out with childcare or joining, supporting SCP and whatnot.

357
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
 The fourth thing is to study scriptures.

358
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,080
 Let me see what these slides are.

359
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,760
 Oh, all right, cool.

360
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,320
 Give me one hot second.

361
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:05,760
 So here in this passage, Paul is like, "Bro, you gotta study the word.

362
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,200
 You need to rightly handle the word of truth.

363
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,440
 Avoid irreverent babble.

364
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
 Don't be like this guy, Philistus and Hymenaeus, who swore from the truth.

365
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,520
 And you need to study the truth in order to not swear from it."

366
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,760
 I could tell all the elders the colors from whether they're the same or not, not because

367
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,940
 I'm smart, and it's not about getting it right for the first time.

368
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,960
 It's about getting it right eventually.

369
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,680
 And so the more you study something, then for sure you'll know it.

370
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,560
 And I think it's the same with the truth and the scripture.

371
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:44,000
 And so as a teacher, I sometimes support students in preparing portfolios for boarding schools

372
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,600
 and college, and they study so hard for standardized testing.

373
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,840
 They study as if their future depends on it, because we all know that our education attainment

374
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,920
 correlates with lifetime earnings, and this is still true for many of us.

375
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,160
 And so I myself took the SATs six times, and I was terrible at it.

376
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,000
 And God doesn't care how much you make.

377
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,500
 He cares about our hearts.

378
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,700
 So we should study the Bible with the same amount rigor, if not more, than if we study

379
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,720
 the GMATs, the MCATs, the DSCs, the IGCSEs, the ACTs, the SATs, as if our lives depend

380
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,760
 on it, because our future actually does.

381
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,580
 How we approach God's work, word, helps us determine how we spend eternity.

382
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,080
 And so we definitely should study it.

383
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,940
 And I love this guy.

384
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,380
 I'm sure moms would be crazy about this guy.

385
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,360
 Good looking guy, went to Oxford and Tsinghua.

386
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,640
 Chan man right there, but who's in my clan?

387
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 This is, this is, this is Tian Zhongshu.

388
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,400
 He writes this book, "Wei Xing," called "The Fortress."

389
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,640
 And there's this quote that just struck me so hard.

390
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,400
 All my life, I've been wanting to give my parents bragging rights.

391
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,440
 So getting into a good school was really important to me.

392
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,040
 But he says, oh, am I supposed to read it?

393
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
 Oh, shoot, it's English Congregation.

394
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:24,920
 Jk. Basically, it says, "(speaking Chinese)." Thank you. "(speaking Chinese)" Clearly my Chinese is not very good.

395
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:37,920
 "(speaking Chinese)" Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

396
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,920
 We are, okay, for those who don't understand, I've Google translated it.

397
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,520
 This diploma seems to have the function of the leaf of Adam and Eve's lower body,

398
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,820
 which can hide shame, ugliness, a small piece of paper can cover up a person's emptiness, ignorance, and stupidity.

399
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,620
 This comes from a guy who went to Oxford and Tsinghua.

400
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,220
 And he says, yo, the academic diploma in Chinese society,

401
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,220
 we see it as that little leaf that covers Adam and Eve's loins.

402
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,420
 And I think it's so true.

403
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:18,220
 Harvard started in 1636 with the intention of establishing a school to train Christian ministers.

404
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,220
 And I want to read you what the rules and precepts were in 1646.

405
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,920
 Before I do, I'll tell you that this used to be the seal.

406
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,320
 And it says, "Et Christos Ecclesia," which means "In Christ in the Church."

407
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,020
 And I think this is the Widener Library, maybe.

408
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,020
 And there used to be one book flipped down,

409
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:47,420
 which is trying to show you that symbolizes the limit of reason and the need for God's revelation.

410
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,920
 But they've since changed the seal to like three books up and "Veritas."

411
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,320
 And it's like the most secular place you could ever be in.

412
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,220
 And Harvard is now home to the marriage-wrecking MBA,

413
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:07,720
 according to the Financial Times, with the highest divorce rates amongst graduate school people.

414
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,020
 But I'm going to read you what Harvard's rules and precepts are.

415
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,120
 "Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well.

416
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,620
 The main end of his life and studies is to know God and Jesus Christ, which is eternal life."

417
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,820
 John 17, 3.

418
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,720
 "And therefore to lay Christ in the bottom as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning.

419
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,220
 And seeing that the Lord only giveth wisdom,

420
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,120
 let everyone seriously set himself by prayer in secret to seek it of him."

421
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,220
 Proverbs 2, 3.

422
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,520
 "Everyone shall so exercise himself in reading the scripture twice a day,

423
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,220
 and he shall be ready to give such an account of his proficiency therein,

424
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,320
 both in theoretical observations and language and logic,

425
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,120
 and in practical spiritual truth, as his tutor shall require according to his ability.

426
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,720
 Seeing the entrance of the word giveth light, it giveth understanding to the simple."

427
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:10,320
 So that used to be, um, bummer, because I think they could have done more better or whatnot.

428
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,820
 So for those who are like, "Oh, I wish God would speak to me.

429
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,520
 I don't know what God's will is for me.

430
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,420
 Oh, man, I'm so lost.

431
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,920
 I got to find myself."

432
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,820
 There's the Bible.

433
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,220
 I can buy you a copy if you don't have one.

434
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,120
 Lit, we're at number five.

435
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,120
 Keep it clean.

436
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:38,120
 He says, yeah, Paul gives this illustration of like these vessels, right?

437
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,320
 And vessels are super important back in the day, and it still is, right?

438
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,820
 You wouldn't drink from something that has a cockroach in it.

439
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,020
 That would be nasty.

440
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,820
 And so same with our bodies, same with our bodies.

441
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:59,120
 We are, our bodies are our temples, for those who are familiar, right?

442
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,220
 That our bodies should be a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,

443
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,520
 which is a place for worship, Romans chapter 12.

444
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,120
 "Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's spirit dwells on you, in you?

445
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,520
 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy you, for God's temple is holy and you are the temple."

446
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,820
 It's 1 Corinthians chapter 3.

447
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,720
 And so, oh, lit.

448
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,020
 So C.S. Lewis gives this like incredible, it's like a quote that I'm about to butcher,

449
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,820
 but it's about like if you had glasses, do you have some glasses?

450
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,020
 Glasses, glasses, right?

451
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,620
 I usually wear glasses.

452
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,420
 For your approval, I wore contacts, right?

453
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:51,620
 If we put, if we put lipstick on glasses, she's gonna do it, she's gonna do it, she's gonna do it.

454
00:29:51,620 --> 00:30:00,720
 And, but, like, how are you, everything, everything you see through this is gonna be like so blurred.

455
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,420
 I can't work wearing these glasses.

456
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,920
 And let me read you his quote.

457
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,320
 Oh, I lost the quote, but basically, our bodies are like eyeglasses.

458
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,820
 If we're not clean, then our vision of God would be blurred.

459
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,320
 Amen, amen.

460
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,020
 All right, let me put this away.

461
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,620
 Cool.

462
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,720
 Yeah, and then, of course, the other illustration is that I'm wearing like a white T-shirt, right?

463
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,020
 Like, we gotta keep things clean.

464
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:33,120
 And God gives us this like incredible strategy, right?

465
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,420
 He's like, bro, you gotta flee, don't fight.

466
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,920
 Like, if I, let's say, Moe versus, T-shirt versus Sharpie, who's gonna win?

467
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,020
 Who's gonna win?

468
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,220
 Who's gonna win?

469
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
 We know this.

470
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,820
 We know this.

471
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,420
 Is she gonna do it?

472
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,020
 Is she gonna do it?

473
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,820
 Is she gonna do it?

474
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,520
 No, she's not.

475
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,520
 'Cause I'm cheap.

476
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,420
 And so, it's so important because when we get defiled, we are not ready for every good work.

477
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,720
 We are a dishonorable vessel, and we can't be used by God.

478
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,620
 God will not use you.

479
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,720
 God, in fact, will destroy you.

480
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:18,620
 And so, yeah, don't put lipstick on your glasses and don't put Sharpies in your shirt.

481
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,620
 And so, I love how God knows us so well.

482
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,520
 He gives us two strategies, right?

483
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,120
 He knows that we are weak.

484
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
 So, he's like, dude, don't even bother fighting it.

485
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,520
 Just flee.

486
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,620
 Just leave.

487
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,720
 And then, the second thing is that he calls.

488
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,020
 He asks us to be in community with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart, right?

489
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,220
 So, you gotta be in community with wholesome people.

490
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,720
 Like, first row are like my buddies, right?

491
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,320
 If I struggle, I'm just like calling on them, and they're wholesome people.

492
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,420
 But if I just hang out with like weirdos who are like doing drugs all the time, then that ain't good.

493
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,720
 I'm just gonna be a weirdo who does drugs all the time, and that's not good.

494
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,520
 And so, yes.

495
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,720
 So, do that.

496
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,520
 Flee, don't fight.

497
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,520
 We don't have time for this slide.

498
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,820
 Yeah, and you want to set yourself up for success.

499
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:24,120
 Precisely when I was studying abroad in Jerusalem, there were a bunch of weirdos who like to do drugs at night and like whatever.

500
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,020
 And study abroad, you know, it's a pretty few kids, right?

501
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:34,520
 You get like what, 10, 12 people in your class, and it's hard to like have wholesome people.

502
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,120
 I don't think anybody was Christian in the group.

503
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,720
 And so, it was really hard because people were like, "Oh my gosh, let's go to Tel Aviv."

504
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:50,220
 And Tel Aviv is like very liberal.

505
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,520
 Let's just put it that way.

506
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,720
 And it's the most liberal place you can find in the Middle East.

507
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:05,120
 And my friend Chris told me about this place, which is called Sakat Halal, and it's on number five, Ain Rogel Street.

508
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,020
 And it's lit.

509
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,120
 It's a 24-hour prayer house.

510
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,520
 And every time that I'm just tempted to go to Tel Aviv and party with these people, I go here.

511
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,620
 And it's great because it's open 24 hours, and it's beautiful, and there's always people praying.

512
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,120
 And so, you really want to set yourself up for success, right?

513
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,420
 If, I don't know, I used to love reading Murakami novels, Haruki Murakami.

514
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,520
 He's great.

515
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:34,520
 And then he started writing something about like some super sexual weird thing, and I was like, "Bro, I can't read anymore."

516
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,920
 So, just don't read.

517
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,220
 I switched to nonfiction.

518
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,320
 It's fine.

519
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,720
 Like, so, I think you need to set yourself up for success.

520
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,920
 Don't, like, I think Jesus summarizes it really well.

521
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,920
 He says, "If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you.

522
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:01,020
 It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than have two hands or feet and be casted into eternal fire."

523
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,120
 Matthew 18.8.

524
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,520
 So, yeah, flee.

525
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,420
 Don't fight.

526
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,720
 Find some good buddies.

527
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,520
 Finally, oh, we're doing great on time.

528
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
 Choose kind.

529
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
 Choose kind.

530
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,620
 I love being right for those who know me.

531
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,420
 Like, I'm the most competitive person in games.

532
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,620
 I get so salty when I lose.

533
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:30,820
 I literally just can't handle, because I'm just so, like, my identity is so much tied up to, like, surpassing other people.

534
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:36,620
 And so, that when I don't surpass people, like, I lost to my mom in arm wrestling and ping pong.

535
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,720
 She's the blue person right there.

536
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,320
 And it wounds my pride.

537
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,420
 So, I call up my friend Chris.

538
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,020
 I'm like, "Hey, do you know how to play ping pong?"

539
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,120
 And he's like, "No."

540
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,620
 And I'm like, "Great, let's play."

541
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,620
 And then I won.

542
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,920
 And that's how I sort of fill my self-esteem.

543
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,520
 And, yeah.

544
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,120
 So, right, this is super hard, right?

545
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,020
 I'm the most quarrelsome person I know.

546
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,620
 And he's saying, like, the Lord's servant is not quarrelsome.

547
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,220
 You must be kind to everyone.

548
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,420
 And that's so hard.

549
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,820
 I can't even be kind to the people who are kind to me.

550
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,120
 It's just the hardest.

551
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:20,320
 Able to teach, I do not accept constructive criticism.

552
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
 Thank you.

553
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
 And, yeah.

554
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,820
 And in face of evil, I just rage.

555
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:33,120
 And on the chance that I get to correct opponents, I'm like, "It's payback time, baby."

556
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,420
 So, it's just, like, straight-up vengeance.

557
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,120
 And my helper came today to support me.

558
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,120
 And she could testify how terrible of a person I am, just in my rage.

559
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,920
 She's the receiver of most of my rage.

560
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,120
 And so, if God can use a person like me, he definitely can use a people like you.

561
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:03,520
 And so, just in closing, none of us, none of us, all right, just be nice.

562
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
 Let's go back to this.

563
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,720
 Sorry.

564
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,020
 Sorry, I'm almost there.

565
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:19,220
 In closing, I want to say that none of us are able to achieve any of this apart from the Father,

566
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,820
 apart from constant prayer.

567
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:27,220
 And I hope you see this chapter not necessarily as an instruction manual or a Christianized self-help theory,

568
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,920
 to-do list, BuzzFeed, blah, blah, blah.

569
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,820
 But it's actually a wonderful gift of wisdom from God on how we ought to approach work in life.

570
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:45,520
 And so, yeah, so when you think about working for God, many of us think, go straight to, like, missionaries.

571
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,520
 James, I don't know, John Snowgrove.

572
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,020
 But that's not biblical.

573
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,720
 The author of Timothy was a, Paul was a tentmaker.

574
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
 Joseph, Jesus' father, was a carpenter.

575
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,520
 Luke was a doctor.

576
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,820
 Matthew was a tax collector.

577
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,920
 Boaz was a farmer.

578
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,020
 Uriah was a soldier.

579
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,420
 David was a shepherd musician.

580
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,920
 And King Deborah is the only female judge in the Old Testament.

581
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,320
 And then there's this guy called Truett Cathy, who's the founder of Chick-fil-A.

582
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,520
 Anybody know the vision of Chick-fil-A?

583
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
 It's so lit.

584
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,720
 I'm going to read it to you.

585
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
 It's so lit.

586
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,920
 The vision statement for Chick-fil-A, which is on their website right now, reads,

587
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,720
 "To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us,

588
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,120
 to have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A."

589
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,320
 So for those who are like, "I can't do this.

590
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,020
 I work in a large corporate.

591
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,020
 Everybody's so pagan."

592
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,620
 Yo, you got no excuses because Chick-fil-A did it.

593
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,620
 So in closing, I want to rap for you guys if we have time.

594
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
 Do we have time?

595
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,420
 Yes?

596
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,320
 Possibly?

597
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,520
 Okay, lit.

598
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,420
 All right.

599
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,420
 First, I need...

600
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,120
 Barbie, can you pass me that water?

601
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,720
 Oh, so lit.

602
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,820
 Okay, okay.

603
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,920
 This is going to be dope.

604
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:09,520
 And also to illustrate just the greatness of the one-finger bottle twist.

605
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,120
 No, not.

606
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,520
 The greatness of the collective.

607
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,220
 Why there is no such thing as a one-person church.

608
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,020
 I want to show you.

609
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,620
 This is an app that I use to teach my students.

610
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,320
 But now I'm going to use it to teach you why the collective is great.

611
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,620
 Oh my, I closed the...

612
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,120
 I closed it.

613
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,620
 Barbie, I closed it.

614
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,120
 Where is it?

615
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,320
 Screenshots.

616
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,120
 Screenshots.

617
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,920
 I got you.

618
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,620
 I got you.

619
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,220
 Desktop.

620
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,620
 Desktop.

621
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,220
 I'm so nervous.

622
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,920
 My heart's pounding.

623
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,020
 It ain't working.

624
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,520
 Desktop.

625
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,420
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,520
 Litty.

627
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,920
 Hell yeah.

628
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,420
 Cool.

629
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,020
 It's the devil.

630
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,720
 I know, I know, I know.

631
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,920
 Dude, I teach technology.

632
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,220
 You're making me look so bad.

633
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,920
 Some of my students are right here.

634
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
 Sorry.

635
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,720
 All right, we good, we good.

636
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,220
 Okay.

637
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,220
 So, right.

638
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,420
 So, this is like the church.

639
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,320
 So, we're going to throw on some beats.

640
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,920
 Is there sound?

641
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,020
 Oh, there's no sound yet.

642
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,520
 I'm going to make it sound.

643
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,520
 Yeah.

644
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,920
 Please, please have sound.

645
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,520
 Oh, okay.

646
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,420
 Right, it's kind of boring.

647
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,420
 But let's get this.

648
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,220
 What?

649
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
 Right.

650
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,320
 Let me pick some.

651
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,120
 Right.

652
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,320
 So, this is like the church.

653
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,320
 They all like, if we're just like alone, it's not going to be very good.

654
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,320
 So, I'm going to pick some folks.

655
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,020
 All right, I'm going to get to it.

656
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,320
 Hold up, hold up.

657
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
 Hold up, hold up.

658
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,820
 Ooh, look at that bass.

659
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,420
 Oh.

660
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,320
 Hey.

661
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,020
 Right.

662
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020
 Okay.

663
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,420
 Okay, it's happening.

664
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,620
 It's happening.

665
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,320
 Oh, man.

666
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,520
 It's moving.

667
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,920
 Okay.

668
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,520
 So, it's a remix of 2 Timothy 2 that I wrote.

669
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,920
 Hope you remember it.

670
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,320
 And I wrote it to the, anybody know what these chords are to?

671
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,520
 It's actually to Tones and I's Dance Monkey.

672
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,820
 So, I wrote it to that.

673
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,020
 All right, great.

674
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,220
 Oh, lit.

675
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,120
 Wait, wait for it.

676
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,920
 Hey.

677
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,720
 Oh, my God, the world can't satisfy.

678
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,120
 Take my life, my Lord, and make it multiply.

679
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:04,520
 You know my heart, my passion, my desires.

680
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:11,520
 Now I beg you take the plank out of my eyes.

681
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,320
 Oh, I know you love me, love me all the time.

682
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:25,620
 And oh my, you even call me your child.

683
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:32,020
 You make me, make me, make me want to be holier.

684
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:39,720
 Now I try, now I try to make you proud.

685
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,520
 Timothy, Timothy, Timothy, don't you forget.

686
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:53,520
 You gotta fight like a soldier and run like a victor for the sake of the elect.

687
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,820
 Timothy, Timothy, Timothy, don't you sweat.

688
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:07,120
 I might die in this prison, but Jesus is risen from the dead.

689
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,420
 To live, you gotta die. To live, you gotta die.

690
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,120
 Seek first and find. Suffer and rise.

691
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:21,020
 Flee desires and focus on the prize 'cause the prize is rooted in Jesus Christ.

692
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,520
 Soak up his grace. It's okay to lose faith, to lose the right race.

693
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,720
 It ain't about how much you make, the cars you chase, the wine you taste,

694
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,020
 or what's on your birthday cake.

695
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,820
 It's about our holy father and his faith.

696
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,320
 When we turned him away, he remained faithful and gave his only son to repay our godless days.

697
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,120
 Instead of peace, love, and faith, we're filled with lust, lies, and shame,

698
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,520
 obsessing over ourselves instead of spending time to pray.

699
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,420
 It could have been game over, but he gave us a chance to be holy forever

700
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,520
 and literally became the lamb that was slain.

701
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,120
 Hey, real talk. Jesus is the only way.

702
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,820
 Oh, oh, hold up. Hold up.

703
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,720
 Oh, we need this guy. Yeah.

704
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,120
 What?

705
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:08,020
 Oh my god, the world can't satisfy.

706
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:14,520
 Take my life, my lord, for it is yours, not mine.

707
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,120
 Let us pray, brothers.

708
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:23,920
 Oh, oh, oh. Let us pray. Let's pray. Let us pray.

709
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
 You wanna pray? I pray? I pray.

710
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,720
 Okay, lit. I get to pray. That's great.

711
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,420
 All right, clap for Jesus.

712
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,520
 Lord, thank you so much for this time that I got to share to Timothy 2.

713
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,420
 Thank you that you are a God, a boss that does have clear expectations.

714
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,620
 You've given us the word that you don't get mad

715
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,920
 because we don't understand your expectations,

716
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,720
 but you've clearly outlined it for us, Lord,

717
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,220
 that you've called us to make disciples, to train the trainers, Lord,

718
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:01,620
 that you've called us to study scripture, to endure, to enjoy, to suffer, Lord,

719
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,520
 to flee from desires and to be nice to everybody.

720
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,320
 Father God, we love you. We thank you.

721
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,820
 I just pray that just tonight that we would not only be hearers of the word, Lord,

722
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,420
 that we would be doers of the word.

723
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,220
 For faith without works is dead.

724
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:27,920
 And so, Lord, I just pray that our works would make our faith perfect,

725
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,220
 as James, the real James, Bible James says.

726
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,120
 And we thank you, we love you in your precious name. Amen.

727
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,620
 Litty.
