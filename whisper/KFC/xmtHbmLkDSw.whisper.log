[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   Good evening everybody and thank you Bonnie.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:19.780]   Famous French underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau said this, "From birth, man carries
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.160]   the weight of gravity on his shoulders.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:40.160]   He is bolted to the earth, but man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free."
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:49.720]   Man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:00.080]   Two weeks ago I presented a new thing, a vision for 2022.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.720]   I highlighted the area of emotional health.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.680]   I said I believed it was the number one issue that was facing the church today.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.800]   We didn't waste any time.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:27.560]   We immediately kicked off our new sermon series, Health for All, All for God.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.200]   On cue as it were, the new government restrictions almost advertised it for us.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.280]   I bumped into a mum the other day and she had primary school pupils.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.320]   I think I saw her five minutes after the latest announcement.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.960]   She said, "This is going to drive us crazy again."
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.640]   Last week we had James' excellent sermon, The Place of Pain Experiencing Sorrow.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.920]   It sets the scene for where we will be over the next eight weeks.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.720]   You need to hear it.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:15.200]   What I loved about James' sermon was its focus on biblical leaders, especially Jesus,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.260]   and the three ways that enabled Jesus to deal with sorrow.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.720]   It sets a role model for us.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.280]   Firstly because Jesus didn't face sorrow alone, we shouldn't.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.040]   Remember he was with Peter, James, and John.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.520]   Secondly, because Jesus didn't hide his feelings, we shouldn't.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.400]   You remember he said, "Father, if this cup can be taken from me."
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.200]   And thirdly, because Jesus didn't avoid the pain, we shouldn't.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.400]   Remember he said, "Yet not my will, but yours be done."
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.920]   Please check James' sermon.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.440]   It will shape our next two months.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.200]   And I have a recommendation.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.800]   Please join a clan and get buried into the accompanying study.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.400]   Now let's turn to Luke chapter three.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.360]   Now Luke's first three chapters are about Jesus' family, his origin, his birth.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.320]   And then finally we read in Luke 3 23 this,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.280]   "Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age."
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.600]   Now the word ministry is actually not there in the Greek.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.400]   It actually says, "Jesus was about thirty years of age when it began."
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.840]   And it goes on, "being the son, as was supposed, of Joseph."
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.560]   And then we have a genealogy.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   You can skip it.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.720]   Actually, the truth is we invariably do, right?
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.600]   Go right down to the end of the chapter and then we read that Jesus was the son of Adam,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.880]   the son of God.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.120]   Now look at this and Bonnie read it to us.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.040]   And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.560]   Now when he refers to the Jordan here, he's referring to the region around the famous
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.960]   river in Israel.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:50.640]   He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness for forty days being tempted by the devil.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.240]   He was hungry.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.520]   Do you find that odd?
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.440]   He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.680]   Led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:19.600]   Now in the original Greek, the word that the ESV translates as wilderness is a word, "Eremos."
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.260]   I'll repeat that, "Eremos."
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.680]   Now a question.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.980]   When you see the word wilderness, what image does it conjure up for you?
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.000]   Sometimes it's translated as desert.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.880]   And we get visions, don't we, of heat and sand, just like the Sahara Desert, for instance.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:53.400]   And that's misleading because the key point is it was empty.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.360]   Nobody around for miles and miles.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:09.000]   The word translated as lonely, isolated, deserted, and the best translation, I believe, is perhaps
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   the solitary place.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   But why would Jesus, why would the Spirit take Jesus to the Eremos, the wilderness,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   the solitary place?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.520]   Because Jesus' clash with Satan was inevitable.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.480]   He had a calling from God to succeed where Adam and Eve failed.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.200]   As James told us last week, they failed in the Garden of Eden, where in a sense every
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.360]   human being in history, including you and me, have also failed.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.240]   Jesus had to succeed.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.000]   And here's the point.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   Most of us see the Eremos as a place of weakness.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:27.960]   I mean, Jesus in the wilderness, 40 days without food, on his own, tired and hungry.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   But rather than the wilderness being a place of weakness, in fact, it's a place of strength.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   Let me say it again, rather than the wilderness being a place of weakness, it is in fact a
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.160]   place of strength.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:00.000]   Commenting on Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, author Dallas Willard wrote this, "Most to
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.960]   whom I have spoken about this matter are shocked by the suggestion that the wilderness, the
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.640]   place of solitude and deprivation, was actually the place of strength and strengthening for
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:19.760]   our Lord, and that the Spirit led him there as he would lead us there, to ensure that
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.520]   Christ was in the best possible condition for the trial."
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.760]   In that desert solitude, Jesus fasted for more than a month.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:41.160]   Then and not before was Satan allowed to approach him with his glittering proposals of bread,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.280]   fame and power.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   Only then Jesus was at the height of his power.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:59.400]   And what we see throughout Jesus' life is that he sought the solitary place on a regular
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.960]   basis.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:09.040]   We often read about Jesus slipping away, getting out in the middle of the night or at daybreak,
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.160]   not to pop down to the 7-Eleven, but to be in the Eremos.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:22.040]   For example, let's skip down to the end of chapter 4.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:29.880]   Most of chapter 4 is about what we would call a brutally long day in the life of Jesus of
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   Nazareth.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.760]   In the morning, he's preaching and teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum, casting out
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.880]   an unclean spirit.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.080]   In the afternoon, he's healing Peter's mother-in-law.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.280]   And then we read in verse 40, "Now the sun was setting and all those who had any were
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.000]   sick with various diseases were brought to him.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.200]   And he laid hands on every one of them and healed them."
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.360]   We read he was casting out demons late into the night.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.440]   And finally, finally, we read this.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.160]   Now, can you guess what that is in Greek?
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:32.840]   Yes, it says that Jesus went into the Eremos.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   Now look at how Mark's gospel phrases this verse.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.200]   It's slightly different.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.520]   And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went to
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   a desolate place.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.800]   And there he prayed.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.320]   There he prayed.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.160]   Now let's read on in Mark verses 36 to 39.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.480]   People were looking for him and trying to keep him from going away.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.960]   Verse 36, "And Simon and those who were with him searched for him.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.880]   And they found him and said to him, 'Everyone is looking for you.'
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:25.000]   And he said to them, 'Let's go on to the next towns, that I might preach there also.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.760]   For that is why I came out.'
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:36.920]   And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons."
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.480]   So here's the thing.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   After a ridiculously busy day, he doesn't have a lie in.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.400]   He gets up early in the morning.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:58.680]   He goes out and maybe just a short walk to the Eremos, a solitary place, all alone in
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.760]   the quiet.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.600]   And he is in prayer to God the Father.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:13.240]   And he comes out of the Eremos with four things that I want to share with you now.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.640]   The first thing he has is this.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.360]   He has clarity about what he is supposed to do.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.920]   He said, "Let's go on to the next town that I might preach there.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.720]   For this is why I came out."
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.640]   Clarity.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.560]   He said, "I'm not just sent to Capernaum.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.400]   I'm also sent," other versions of the Bible says, "For this purpose, I was sent to Galilee,
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   Judea, and eventually to Jerusalem.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:51.600]   I have this crystal clear idea of who I am and what I'm supposed to do."
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:13:00.720]   The second thing he has is this, the ability to say no to good things.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:08.360]   Oh, people come to him and said, "Everyone is asking for you in Capernaum."
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.440]   And this is a great opportunity for Jesus.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.200]   The team from KFCI visited Capernaum a couple of years ago.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.520]   It is a strategic location.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.880]   It's right on the major north-south trade route.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.920]   We call it a gateway city.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.240]   Do something amazing in Capernaum, word will spread.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.960]   Jesus said, "Nah, I'm okay, thank you."
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   He was aware of Oswald Chambers' axiom, that good is always the enemy of the best.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.000]   Have you heard that one?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.320]   Good is always the enemy of the best.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.860]   He was aware that life is short and fleeting.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:57.720]   You could only say yes to a short list of things.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.480]   He was of course aware of the danger of busyness.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:13.760]   Dallas Willard once called hurry the great enemy of spiritual life in our day.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.200]   He said this, "You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life."
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.960]   I love this.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.080]   Last year, I read a book by John Mark Comer, who has inspired this series.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.680]   His excellent book called "The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry."
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.040]   I recommend it.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.320]   Because in Hong Kong, our life is rush, rush, rush, rush.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:45.560]   You see someone running for an MTR train and the next one's gonna be there in two minutes.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:51.760]   Jesus comes out of the Eremos with clarity about what he's supposed to do
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.640]   and the ability to say no to good things.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.000]   But the third thing he has is immersion in God's presence.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.020]   Over and over in Luke's gospel, we read, I read it earlier, that Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.420]   He lived in 24 saturation with God.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.280]   He was swimming in God's presence all day long.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:27.480]   And finally, he comes out for empowering for God's work.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.740]   We read, didn't we?
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.200]   He said to them, "Let's go on to the next towns that I might preach there also, for
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.080]   that is why I came out."
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:43.400]   And he went into Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   He was determined to step out into everything that God had for him.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.980]   So he goes into the Eremos, tired, stressed out, thinking about the thousands and thousands
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.720]   of people who want a chunk of him.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:09.560]   But he comes out with clarity about what he's supposed to do, with the ability to say no
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:19.760]   to good things, immersed in God's presence, and empowered for kingdom work.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.920]   Now a lot of us, and I'll be honest, I am the biggest culprit here.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.580]   A lot of us are the exact opposite.
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:36.080]   Most of the time, instead of clarity about what we're supposed to do, we have confusion
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.480]   about what we're supposed to do.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.780]   Instead of the ability to say no, we say yes to far too much.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:50.480]   Instead of immersion in God's presence, we feel disconnected from God, like he is far
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   away.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:58.920]   And instead of empowering for kingdom work, we feel stressed out, on edge, runny on empty,
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.880]   even a little bit grouchy or grumpy.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   I'm just saying, maybe, maybe it's because we don't spend enough time in the Eremos.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:24.240]   The French mathematician Blaise Pascal wrote this, "All man's misery is derived from not
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.600]   being able to sit quietly in a room alone."
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:37.560]   We have become experts at filling our lives with noise and activities.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:49.440]   You and I have become expert, have been filling our lives with activities.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.960]   Ouch.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:58.120]   Now many of you will have heard about the spiritual disciplines.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:06.480]   A spiritual discipline is a habit, something you do on a regular basis in order to live
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.880]   every moment of every day in awareness of God's presence.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   Spiritual disciplines are habits, practices, experience that are designed to develop and
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.660]   grow and strengthen certain qualities of spirit.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:32.360]   As it were, build the muscles of one character and to expand the breadth of one's inner life.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.520]   They structure the workouts which train the soul.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:45.640]   Some spiritual disciplines are personal, inward exercises that are practiced alone.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:53.240]   Others require interpersonal relationships and are practiced in community.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:59.500]   My favourite book in this area, it shaped my life as a young Christian about 40 years
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:05.080]   ago was a celebration of discipline by Richard Foster.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:12.000]   In it he says this, "The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.800]   people or gifted people, but for deep people."
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:24.700]   And there are various books that have been written about this subject and together they
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:31.080]   have a list of about 20 or so spiritual disciplines.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:38.760]   But what I've seen, there are about five that consistently percolate to the surface.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.040]   I've put them on the screen.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:51.320]   They're silence, solitude, prayer, fasting, and meditation.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.360]   Let's just look at them briefly.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.240]   Silence is so difficult in Hong Kong, isn't it?
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.120]   And it's difficult for us extroverts, right?
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:10.960]   Silence is a world with no noise, no cell phones, no people, no traffic, no city.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:20.200]   Solitude, you're all on your own, no friends, just you and the God who made you.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.320]   Prayer, you are in dialogue with God.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.480]   You talk to God and you listen to God.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.440]   You're hearing God's voice.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.200]   And we have some teaching available here at this church.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.560]   If you want to find more about it, please write in and ask us.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.880]   Fasting, going without food or something else, social media, for example.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.520]   Again, we have teaching available on this.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:54.360]   And meditation, what is God saying through his scriptures?
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.480]   But more than that, what is God saying through nature?
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:05.960]   Meditation is quite simply to open up your life to God.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.920]   The truth is when we first read a book about spiritual disciplines,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.840]   we want to start packing our bags and go to a monastery
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.400]   or hike up to Tai Ma Shan or Sunset Peak.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.200]   And there is certainly time for this.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   I recommend places like Bethany in Cheung Chau.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:34.080]   And we did see Jesus and we do see Jesus in the Eremos, 40 days without food.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:45.000]   But in this story, the one I just read, Jesus goes to the Eremos for an hour or two in the morning.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:56.080]   So it's not just a crazy mountain top experience, but something we can do every day.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:02.520]   I want to encourage you, however you're wired, extrovert or introvert,
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:13.240]   whatever your schedule is, you set apart part of your life just for God.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.920]   Phone off, no checking last night's sports results.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.200]   Give God your first fruits, not your leftovers.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:36.480]   Have a set place at a set time and make it non-negotiable.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:45.880]   I said two weeks ago, Hong Kong people's favourite expression is, "I'm too busy."
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:52.200]   Let's for a moment talk about why you are too busy.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.640]   Look at Luke 5, 15.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.680]   "Yet the news about him spread all the more, so the crowds of people came to hear him
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.600]   and to be healed of their sicknesses."
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.800]   Jesus had gone viral.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.880]   But look at verse 16.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:18.760]   "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed."
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.720]   Now you know what the Greek word for lonely places is?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.640]   You guessed it, Eremos.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   On a regular basis, he was in the Eremos, he was in the wilderness.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.400]   Now here's the thing, I'm sure Jesus was busy.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:44.680]   I'm also sure that if you're busier than Jesus, you are not emotionally healthy.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.280]   But Jesus made this a part of his life.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.560]   And I think I can say that the busier that Jesus got, the more he got away.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:04.840]   The more he got into silence, solitude, prayer, fasting, meditation.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   The truth is for us, for me, it's often the complete opposite.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.360]   Life gets complicated, doesn't it?
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:23.040]   And the first thing that goes is the very thing that was the axis of Jesus' life and ministry.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:28.360]   Could this be the reason that many of us are so emotionally unhealthy
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.560]   and feel so out of sync with God?
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.800]   The God we want to be with, but we see is far away.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:45.280]   Could it be that one of the reasons we simply do not spend enough time in the Eremos?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.040]   Now I know we're all wired differently, right?
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.480]   I'm a serial multitasker.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.960]   My mum used to tell me when I was a schoolboy, right?
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.800]   I'd be at home trying to do my homework, right?
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:07.160]   But I'd be watching the TV, doing my homework and bouncing a ball all at the same time.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.600]   It may be one of the reasons why I was always top at school for classwork
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.800]   and always bottom for homework.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:18.760]   But however you are wired, we all need this.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.440]   And I'm going to encourage you this week, I'm going to challenge you this week
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:31.080]   to find that space for silence, solitude, prayer, fasting and meditation.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.400]   Away from people.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.360]   I suggest noise cancelling headphones.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.880]   Get your phone off.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.680]   Not answering emails.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.680]   Oh my goodness, WhatsApp groups.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.480]   What is it with WhatsApp groups?
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:52.720]   Why do people send you WhatsApps at 11.45 at night?
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.520]   Wherever you are on the spectrum of introvert, extrovert,
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:06.280]   we all need the right balance between solitude and community.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.000]   Solitude without community leads to isolation.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.440]   We don't want that.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.360]   That's why I said in our vision,
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.720]   we want every person in this congregation to be in a small group.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.600]   But community without solitude goes by all sorts of names.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   Let me give you two.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.800]   Anxiety, depression.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.360]   And I know that from personal experience,
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:40.640]   having spent a chunk of 2020 and 21 taking antidepressants.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.960]   I am therefore calling you to community.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:55.120]   But in the same way, I am calling you to silence and solitude.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:00.960]   It would be so easy for me to stop right here.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.080]   But we can't.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   We're not done.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.680]   Over the next few weeks,
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:15.320]   we will be looking at the principles of an emotionally healthy church.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.680]   And the first one, the title of today's talk is this,
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.480]   look beneath the surface.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:30.080]   Peter Sekiro in his book, in his Emotionally Healthy series, says this,
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.680]   "In emotionally healthy churches,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.960]   people take a deep hard look inside their heart,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:43.200]   asking what is going on that Jesus Christ wants to change.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.720]   They understand that a person's life is like an iceberg
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:55.920]   with the vast majority of who we are lying deep beneath the surface.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.480]   They invite God to bring to their awareness
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.560]   and to transform those beneath the surface layers
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:11.280]   that hinder them from becoming more like Jesus Christ.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.360]   You can go to the top of a rock
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:21.680]   and still miss the stuff that is churning away beneath the surface.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.920]   An iceberg is a huge chunk of ice
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.800]   that breaks off from a glacier and floats around the ocean.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.280]   Most of an iceberg is under the water and can't be seen.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:40.560]   And that's how a sneaky iceberg managed to sink the Titanic.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.600]   But once again, Jesus is our template.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.680]   Let's turn to Matthew 26.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.200]   And let's end tonight where James started last week.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.480]   Matthew 26, 36.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.040]   "Then Jesus went with him to a place called Gethsemane.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:06.320]   And he said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.'
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.680]   And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,"
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.080]   that's James and John,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.000]   "he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.480]   Then he said to them, 'My soul is very sorrowful even to death.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.520]   Remain here and watch with me.'"
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.600]   Now look at this.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.040]   "And going a little further,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.360]   he fell on his face and prayed,
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.000]   'My father, if it is possible,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.920]   let this cup pass from me.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:53.520]   Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.'"
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:01.680]   So Jesus is in the garden with his three closest disciples, his buddies.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.240]   And yet he still removes himself to a quiet spot.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.480]   Now there's two things.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.840]   He is aware of his emotions.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.920]   My soul is very sorrowful.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.520]   He was in touch with his feelings.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.640]   And secondly, he understands why he has these feelings.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.760]   Father, if it was possible, let this cup be taken from me.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.080]   He is hours away from execution, from torture,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.040]   from death, from rejection, from abandonment.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.800]   And here's my point.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   These times of getting away to the Elamos,
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:49.000]   whether it was 40 days in the desert, miles from anyone without food,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.640]   or a few feet away from his disciples in a park just outside the city,
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:06.480]   it wasn't time to read the Bible and pray, as good as that is.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.680]   But for Jesus, it was also time to look beneath the surface,
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:18.280]   to get in touch with what he was feeling and to ask the why question
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.240]   and to bring it before his father.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.760]   So what does that mean for us?
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:33.840]   Firstly, it is important that we have an awareness of how we are feeling,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.680]   acknowledging and an acknowledging of what we are doing.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.760]   But secondly, I must stress this, we've got to ask the why question.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.160]   We need to say, "I'm really stressed out."
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.080]   Why?
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.280]   "I'm really on edge."
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.280]   Why?
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:01.280]   "Why do I feel I have to put another post on social media?"
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   "Why do I feel so sad when I see other people on IG seeming happy?"
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.280]   "Why am I comparing?"
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   "Why am I so critical of others?"
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:24.280]   "Why am I working hour after hour after hour to succeed?"
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   Whatever that means.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:35.280]   But invariably, we don't take time to ask why.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   Can I submit that one of the reasons we don't ask the question is that we are too busy?
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   Another reason is that we are too scared.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   We are too scared to look beneath the surface.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.280]   Sometimes we don't like what we find.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   It's too painful.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:12.280]   Pain is sometimes God's way for getting our attention.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   I mean, when we pray, "God, take these feelings away."
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   I've discovered He seldom answers that one.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   The reality is that God doesn't want to change our emotions.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   He wants to change our lives.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   He wants to deal with the roots of our emotions.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   And in that place, Jesus is waiting for us.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   In that place of pain, in our Gethsemane, as Jesus told us last week.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   My point is this.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   It can be terrifying to get away to the Alamos
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.280]   and to clear out all the noise and distraction,
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   the latest Netflix series, the hectic social life, and to listen.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.280]   To listen to God, oh yes.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   But also to listen to yourself.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   What is beneath the surface?
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:22.280]   To what you are feeling, to open your life up for Jesus to change you.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   And for you to realise what is causing the emotional pain.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   And my friends, here's the bottom line.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.280]   Run to the Father.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.280]   Run to the Father, just like the prodigal son did.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.280]   Don't run away from Him.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   Don't run away from your issues.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   You will not solve them by getting busier, more meetings, activity, activity, activity.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   This is why the love of God is so amazingly powerful.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   In the midst of Jesus' emotional pain, what does he call God?
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.280]   My Father.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   My Father.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.280]   In a few moments, Paul and the band are going to sing a song.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.280]   We sang it earlier.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.280]   We're going to be singing these words.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   I want to encourage you wherever you are to join in.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   It might be interesting if you're dialing in from the MTR.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   I run to the Father.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   I fall into grace.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   I'm done with the hiding.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.280]   No reason to wait.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.280]   My heart needs a surgeon.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   My soul needs a friend.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   So I run to the Father again and again and again and again and again.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   My friend, don't suppress your emotion.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   Be aware.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   Ask yourself why.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   I'm not promising anyone a quick fix.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   I'm not going to call you to the front if I could and lay hands on you and the whole thing is fixed.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   It is rarely as simple as that.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   But if you will do as Jesus did in his anguish, in his pain,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   he was literally sweating blood.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   If you will do as Jesus did and run to the Father,
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   there you will find both a surgeon and a friend.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   I'm going to ask the worship band to come up now.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   But what we're going to do, rather than just rush into the song,
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   is I'm going to invite everyone, whether you're here with us today, whether you're at home,
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.280]   we're going to take a period of silence.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   We don't do that very often in church, do we?
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   This is not an excuse now to switch off and get on with your life.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   But actually, I feel this is very important for us as a church.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   So what we're going to do now is we're going to have a period of just silence.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   I'm not going to even pray now. We're going to have silence.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   And then Paul and the band will lead us in this song.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   And then Pastor Michelle will come up and pray for us.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   So let's just have this time of complete silence.
