1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 The farmer who obeyed God.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Johnny told us last week about Gideon the farmer and his transition from doubter to believer

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 and from believer to warrior.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And tonight we will see his victory.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 A victory against all odds.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Now you might be able to identify with that at the moment.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 We all feel like that at the moment that we are battling against the odds.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 That the odds are stacked up against us.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Now many people have had to do what we call downsizing.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And basically downsizing is to do more with less.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Some people have lost their jobs.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Some people are not able to get to appointments, not able to make sales.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Some people are really struggling at the moment.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I believe that sometimes God trims our resources in order for us to depend on him.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Sickness, financial reversal, family conflict and other difficulties can cause us to turn our lives to God.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 But we need to remember this, that when the odds seem overwhelming, God overwhelms the odds.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I'll say that again.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 When the odds seem overwhelming, God overwhelms the odds.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 But when it comes to war, nations don't usually downsize.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 They usually do the opposite.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 They mobilise their reserves.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 They cancel all leave and requests for discharge and retirement.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 They need every man they can get.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And as we continue to look at Gideon, we see in Judges chapter 7,

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 that God is going to ask him to do something which to many nations would seem crazy.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Now remember, the Gideon's army was already hugely outnumbered.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Judges 8.10 tells us that the Midianite army was 135,000 strong.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 While Gideon's force numbered a mere 32,000 according to Judges 7.3.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 One Israelite for every four Midianites.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Now I don't know about you, but Gideon must have thought,

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 "We've got no chance against an army that size."

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 But Gideon at least understood the might of his enemy.

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I think for us sometimes you see we are oblivious to the forces around us

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 that try to snare us and defeat us.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And so we must recognise that we're engaged in spiritual warfare daily.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 We're battling the world.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 We're battling with flesh, battling the devil and his agents.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Can I go back to Gideon?

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 To guarantee that history would record this battle as a divine victory.

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I mean so much so that we're still talking about it tonight, 3,000 years later.

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 God issued an order for a massive reduction in force.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Let's look at it.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 The Lord said to Gideon, "You have too many men."

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I cannot deliver Midian into their hands or Israel would boast against me.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 My own strength has saved me.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Now announced to the army, anyone who trembles with fear

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 So 22,000 men left while 10,000 remained.

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So 32,000 had become 10,000.

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 But, and it's a very big but, let's read on.

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 The Lord said to Gideon, "There are still too many men.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Take them down to the water and I shall thin them out there for you.

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 If I say this one shall go with you, he shall go.

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 But if I say this one shall not go with you, he shall not go."

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So Gideon took the men down to the water.

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 There, the Lord told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues

57
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink."

58
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 300 of them drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs.

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 All the rest got on their knees to drink.

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 The Lord said to Gideon, "With the 300 men that lapped,

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I will save you and the Midianites into your hands.

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Let all the others go home."

63
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 and he kept the 300 who took over the provisions and the trumpets of the others.

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Let's have a look what happened.

66
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 We went from 32,000 to 10,000.

67
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 If that was not bad enough, we then went from 10,000 to just 300.

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Can you imagine what's going through Gideon's mind right now?

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 He's probably thinking, "God, we had a very slim chance of winning with 32,000 men.

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 But now you want us to fight with 300 against 135,000 Midianites."

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I thought of putting this into a Hong Kong context.

72
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Can you imagine you're on Central Station about six o'clock in the evening?

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 You've just got off your train from Tsim Sha Tsui

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 and people are coming down the entrance.

75
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And instead of going through the exit one,

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 you go the same way as the 450 people are coming down.

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 That was what it was like for Gideon.

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 He was like on the MTR escalator going up the way that everybody was coming down.

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Gideon was left with a mere 300 troops.

80
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And his only option was to trust God, to trust God or perish.

81
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And so he was left virtually without an army.

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But remember this,

83
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 when we are serving in God's army, we become part of the overwhelming majority.

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Can I say it again?

85
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 When we are serving in God's army, we become part of the overwhelming majority.

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And just because we're in the minority,

87
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 it doesn't mean it's all bad.

88
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Because with God, it's never about numbers.

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's about faith.

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And that's why if everyone here at KFCI,

91
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 as small as we are in numbers,

92
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 if each of us would just trust God,

93
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 then He will always provide for victory in our lives.

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 As someone once said,

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 "You cannot be too small for God to use,

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 but you can be too big."

97
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Can I repeat that?

98
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 You cannot be too small for God to use,

99
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 but you can be too big.

100
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Too big.

101
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 In other words,

102
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 if you want credit for what God is doing in you,

103
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 God will not use you.

104
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 That's why when you look around,

105
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 you will see God working in a powerful way

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 in the lives of some very weak people.

107
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 They are Christians who are called to give God the glory.

108
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It begs a question for us.

109
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Do we bask in our victory?

110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Or do we praise God for His work in our lives?

111
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Now, as I mentioned earlier,

112
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 you can only imagine Gideon's state of mind.

113
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 The odds weren't very good to begin with.

114
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And now they had gotten even worse.

115
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And so aware of Gideon's weak faith,

116
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 God reassures him, and you'll love this story,

117
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 by arranging for Gideon to overhear a conversation

118
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 between two enemy soldiers.

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Look at the verse I've put on the screen.

120
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Gideon listens in as two Midianite soldiers

121
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 discuss a strange dream.

122
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Now remember in ancient times,

123
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 dreams were highly regarded

124
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 as a means of predicting future events.

125
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And so in the dream,

126
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 a hard loaf of barley bread

127
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 rolls into the Midianite camp

128
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 and flattens one of the tent.

129
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 They conclude that the loaf represents Israel.

130
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Because remember from John's sermon last week,

131
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 the Midianites had plundered Israel

132
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 and stolen their wheat harvest.

133
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And so the impoverished Jews had to resort to barley bread.

134
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Barley bread was regarded at the time

135
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 as a poor man's alternative to wheat.

136
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And the tent could only represent

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 the nomadic, the wandering Midianites.

138
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It leads one of the soldiers to cry out

139
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 with an awful realisation in Judges 7.14,

140
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon,

141
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 son of Joash the Israelite.

142
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 God has given the Midianites

143
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 and the whole camp into his hands."

144
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Now remember, Gideon was a farmer.

145
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And like we saw last time,

146
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 he asked for a lot of signs from God

147
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 because he needed a lot of reassurance from God.

148
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And so this isn't a spot of luck for Gideon.

149
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 This was not by chance.

150
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 This was his sovereign God

151
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 giving him another sign of his own.

152
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Think about it.

153
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Think about it.

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 God protected Gideon

155
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 during his trip into enemy territory.

156
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 God led Gideon to one specific tent

157
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 and God timed Gideon's arrival

158
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 to hear about a dream and its interpretation.

159
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And look at what happened to Gideon's faith.

160
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 After he heard those men say those things.

161
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Verse 15.

162
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Gideon's fears and doubts had been overcome

163
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 and now he is mentally prepared for the combat.

164
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Don't you just love to read about the growth of Gideon?

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 We see that he went from being a man

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 trembling in a wine press

167
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 to a confident general

168
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 ready to lead his outnumbered troops into battle.

169
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And make no mistake about it.

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Gideon wasn't Winston Churchill.

171
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He was a farmer.

172
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 He was an unconventional leader by secular standards.

173
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 But once again, we see God's strength being revealed

174
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 by enabling what we would call a weak man to triumph.

175
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Gideon was being modest

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 because he knew that he lacked the resources to overcome

177
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 and he had to rely on God.

178
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I don't know about you,

179
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 but there's times in my life

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 when I felt like that.

181
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 When I realized I just couldn't do something

182
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 or get through something on my own strength.

183
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 What the world does, it sells us self-help books

184
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 and motivational talks

185
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 that will help us to believe in ourselves

186
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 in order for us to become more self-reliant.

187
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 But God strips us bare.

188
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 He forces us to recognize our frailties

189
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 and our inadequacies.

190
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 God shows us that human resources

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 are insufficient for the battles we face.

192
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And it is God who teaches us the lesson of dependence,

193
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 which results in confidence.

194
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Now the apostle Paul understood this

195
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 when he said in Philippians 4.13,

196
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 you know the verse,

197
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 "I can do all things through him who gives me strength."

198
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And so with God's power,

199
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Gideon was able to do all things

200
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 and Gideon was able to boldly go into battle.

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He wasn't confident in his own abilities.

202
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 He certainly wasn't confident in the 300.

203
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Yes, 300 soldiers he had with him,

204
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 but he went with the confidence

205
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 knowing that his God was right there with him.

206
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 You're gonna love this next bit.

207
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I wanna take a look at the kind of ammunition

208
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 that Gideon was about to use in battle.

209
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Look at this verse.

210
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Now we would expect to read that the 300 men

211
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 would have been armed with swords or bows and arrows.

212
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But a text said he assembled an army of 300.

213
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 He then divides them into three companies,

214
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 arming them with trumpets, empty clarges,

215
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 or even clay jars and torches.

216
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Now I don't know about you,

217
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 but it sounds more like Gideon

218
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 was setting up a military band

219
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 or sending some personal suppliers into battle.

220
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Now remember what the Lord told Gideon in Judges 6.

221
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 We saw it last week.

222
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.

223
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 The lowly farmer is about to become that mighty warrior.

224
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And Gideon has one thing at that time in his favour.

225
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And it's this, the element of surprise.

226
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And so he takes the lead

227
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 and he says to the 300 troops in Judges,

228
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 verses 17 and 18,

229
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 "Watch me, follow my lead.

230
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 "When I get to the edge of the camp,

231
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 "do exactly as I do.

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 "When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets,

233
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 "then from all around the camp, blow yours

234
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 "and shout for the Lord and for Gideon."

235
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And so at Gideon's command,

236
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 they took positions outside the perimeter of the enemy camp.

237
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Look at this next verse, which tells us what happens.

238
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 We read that during the night,

239
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 there was a sound of 300 jars being smashed on the ground.

240
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 There was the blinding light of 300 torches piercing the darkness

241
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and the thundering sound of 300 rams horns signaling attack.

242
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And with one voice, the Israelite army shouted

243
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 a blood-curdling battle cry,

244
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon."

245
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And what happened next?

246
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The answer is panic stations for the Midianites.

247
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Judges 7, 21 to 25 tells us that the Midianite army

248
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 imagined they were being attacked from all sides.

249
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And because they were totally unprepared,

250
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 this caused confusion and they quickly began attacking each other in the dark,

251
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 not knowing whether it was a friend or a foe.

252
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 The Jewish soldiers held their positions,

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 staying a safe distance, socially distance from the deadly chaos before them.

254
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And that my friends is the story of Judges chapter 7.

255
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 But I just need to summarize what is happening in Judges 8

256
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 because it's all part of Gideon's story.

257
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 In the first 21 verses,

258
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 we see Gideon using the soldiers he had in reserve.

259
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Remember, he had a very, very full substitutes bench, right?

260
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 He sealed off the enemy escape route

261
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 and his troops go out and capture and kill two key enemy officers.

262
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 In verses 22 to 23, we see that out of gratitude,

263
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 the throne of Israel, the throne of Israel is offered to the deliverer.

264
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Gideon is urged to become king.

265
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 But to his credit, Gideon unselfishly declines the offer

266
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 to be crowned king of Israel.

267
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Why? He says in verse 23, he said this to them,

268
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 "The Lord will rule over you."

269
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Gideon knew that he was only an instrument of God

270
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 and Israel's real king was the Lord himself.

271
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 In verses 24 to 32, it tells us that Gideon continued to serve as a judge

272
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 and live out his days in prosperity.

273
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And all he asked from his countrymen is a small portion of the captured gold.

274
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And even then he fashions it into an ephod,

275
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 which was a priestly garment used in worship.

276
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But what was supposed to be a symbol commemorating Israel's victory,

277
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 regrettably became an object of worship.

278
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And once again, note what happens after Gideon passes away

279
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 in verses 33 to 34, I'll read them to you.

280
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 "No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites

281
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 "again prostituted themselves to the Baals.

282
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 "They set up Balbareth as their god,

283
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 "and they did not remember the Lord their God

284
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 "who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side."

285
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And so my friends, week after week, we've seen this.

286
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 The cycle continues.

287
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 They get involved in idolatry.

288
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 They end up in a mess.

289
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 They repent, they cry out to God for help.

290
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 God sends them as a deliverer.

291
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 God chooses that person to deliver them.

292
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And everything is great for a while.

293
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 But as soon as the deliverer dies,

294
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 it starts all over again.

295
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 As we finish,

296
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 let me ask,

297
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 who do we trust?

298
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Who do you trust?

299
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 When we are faced with impossible odds,

300
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 do we fall apart?

301
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Or do we fall on our knees in prayer,

302
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 trusting the Lord of hosts?

303
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And let me just say,

304
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 it is really difficult, if not impossible,

305
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 to have faith in someone you don't know or barely know.

306
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 It's extremely hard to trust someone that you misunderstand

307
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 or are misinformed about.

308
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 What we learned from Gideon is this.

309
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Gideon's ignorance about the Word of God

310
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 was a strong factor in his ability or his inability to trust God.

311
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 He totally misunderstood the very nature,

312
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 the very character of God.

313
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And that's why for us Christians,

314
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 knowing God and knowing His Word

315
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 through personal Bible studies,

316
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 through clans are so important.

317
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Because if we do not live the Word of God in our lives,

318
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 we will show the same unbelief

319
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 and same stubbornness to believe that Gideon had.

320
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 So let me encourage you

321
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 to allow God to use you

322
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 as He used Gideon,

323
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 allowing Him to do great things through you.

324
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Read your Bible.

325
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Study your Bible.

326
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Learn and grow from your Bible.

327
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Join a clan.

328
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Follow those who are demonstrating the example of Christ in their lives.

329
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Gideon was a lonely farmer,

330
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 but with the Lord's help,

331
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 he became a mighty warrior.

332
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 The question is,

333
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 will you finally obey God

334
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 and allow Him to use you

335
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 and help you become the kind of Christian

336
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 that He dearly desires for you to become?

337
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Let's pray together.

338
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 As a learner of commitment,

339
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I just want to commit this time to God.

340
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I just want to commit this time to Him

341
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 and ask you to surrender all you have to Him.

342
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Lord, would you take me as weak as I am

343
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 and would you use me?

344
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Lord, help me get to know you better

345
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 and help me, Lord, to allow you

346
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 to have your way in my life

347
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 and to use me

348
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 in Jesus' name.

349
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 I believe that God is going to use people from this church

350
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 in extraordinary ways,

351
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 in ways that you couldn't even imagine.

352
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Just put yourselves into His hands.

353
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Now, to help us,

354
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I've set some study questions.

355
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 I'm going to put them on the screen.

356
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 We'll have them again at the end or you can get them online.

357
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And I want to take four things that I've said

358
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 and ask you a question about it.

359
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Number one, I said you cannot be too small for God to use,

360
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 but you can be too big.

361
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 My question is how would you feel

362
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 if you were like Gideon having his army reduced

363
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 from 32,000 to 300?

364
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Can you think of a practical occasion

365
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 when you've had to face an equivalent challenge?

366
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Secondly, I said that God shows us that human resources

367
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 are insufficient for the battles we face.

368
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Can you recall a time

369
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 when you've tried to meet a challenge on your resources alone?

370
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And what happened when you decided to trust God instead?

371
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 My third question was quite simple.

372
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Who do we trust?

373
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 My question is this,

374
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 when we're faced with impossible odds,

375
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 do we fall apart or fall on our knees in prayer?

376
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Do we fall apart or fall on our knees in prayer?

377
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Trusting the Lord.

378
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And lastly,

379
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Gideon's ignorance about the Word of God

380
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 was a strong factor in his ability to trust God.

381
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And I want to ask you this question,

382
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 what can I do this week and in the future

383
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 and to know His Word,

384
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 how can I encourage others to do the same?

385
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Let's join in singing this song,

386
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 The Victory is Yours.

387
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:43,000
