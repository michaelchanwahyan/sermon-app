1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
 - Evening everyone.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:07,500
 Good to see you.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,600
 How are we all feeling in this rain?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,440
 We good?

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,900
 I am gonna, I have promised myself today

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,560
 that I'm gonna stand in one spot

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,900
 and protect you all from me.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,480
 So just pray for me as I try and do that.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,700
 I do, I'm one of those,

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,620
 so my background is secondary school teaching,

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,280
 so I would, I'm one of those teachers

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,400
 who would just walk around the room constantly.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,900
 So that's, I mean you see when I preach,

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,080
 that's what I do.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,940
 It's partly just to kind of calm my nerves,

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,040
 but here I am standing behind,

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,540
 can you see me or is there a lot of flash?

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,120
 Wow, what do you guys,

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,500
 oh, the dad jokes.

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,600
 Wow.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,320
 Anyway, I wanna start with a question.

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,680
 When you don't get what you want,

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,920
 what do you do?

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
 Why?

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,040
 Do you know what a two year old does in the supermarket

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,240
 when they don't get the sweets they want

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
 or the toys they want?

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,200
 Do you just, they're a tantrum,

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 is that what you do?

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,900
 Is that, when you've been asking for that one thing,

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,400
 maybe just take it a little bit deeper.

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,980
 Maybe it's not just an item, an object.

33
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,660
 Maybe it's, maybe you're waiting for something for years.

34
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,000
 Maybe you've been waiting for a long time

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,640
 and it still hasn't come.

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
 What do you do?

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,440
 Let me take it even deeper.

38
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,400
 That moment where, maybe just think back

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,840
 and maybe it's not that pleasant to go back,

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,400
 but so those moments where you're in,

41
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,360
 that song we sang at the end,

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,960
 when we're in the valley of the shadow of death,

43
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,800
 in your deepest, darkest, lowest moments,

44
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,640
 what do you do?

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,420
 What do you default to?

46
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,760
 When you're stressed, what do you do?

47
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,920
 See, when I get stressed,

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,960
 so let's say I've had a fight with Christina

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,400
 and I'm feeling very sad for myself

50
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,900
 because obviously she's right.

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,100
 Like, the one, of course, that's the way.

52
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,680
 So I like to sleep.

53
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,660
 When I'm upset or stressed, I sleep.

54
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,500
 Well, actually there's two things I do.

55
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,460
 One is sleep.

56
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,300
 The other is retail therapy and I go shopping.

57
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,140
 Wow, you all giggle as gender stereotypes.

58
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,060
 Well, I like shopping for,

59
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,740
 my weakness is like gadgets, electronics,

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
 like Wan Chai Computer Center.

61
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,820
 Whenever, that's the valley of the shadow of death for me.

62
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,100
 When I walk in there, I'm like,

63
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,700
 what can I, what do I,

64
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,020
 what did I never knew that I ever needed?

65
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,820
 But I know that I need it now.

66
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,660
 What is it I think?

67
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,420
 So those are the two things that I kind of do

68
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,180
 as I go through this.

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,820
 But as I'm looking at the passage today,

70
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,500
 and today we're looking at the story of Hannah,

71
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,300
 we see a woman who didn't get what she wanted

72
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,940
 for many, many years.

73
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,340
 And she was very, very distressed for many, many years.

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,860
 But we see that she does something very interesting.

75
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,780
 She does a very radical thing.

76
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,780
 And it turns her and it takes her from sorrow to joy.

77
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,060
 So if you're looking for a secret sauce or a recipe,

78
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,580
 Hannah shows you what she does.

79
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,260
 And I wanted to go through that journey with you today.

80
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,500
 But those of you who don't know Hannah,

81
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 I wanna just take a step back

82
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,860
 and tell you about a little bit about her.

83
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,380
 So we all know about Moses.

84
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,020
 We all know that he led the Israelites away from Egypt.

85
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,700
 They escaped slavery.

86
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,940
 Then they head into the promised land.

87
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,820
 This promised land is filled with milk and honey.

88
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
 Do you know what happens once they get to the promised land?

89
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,220
 Is it all fun and games?

90
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,180
 No.

91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,060
 You then go through the season and you see,

92
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,940
 last summer we did, was it last summer

93
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,780
 when we went to the book of Judges?

94
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,700
 I feel as though it might have been.

95
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,260
 It's all blurred together now these years.

96
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,140
 Now we see the Israelites, they get to this promised land.

97
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,220
 And what do they do?

98
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,540
 They just go into these vicious cycles,

99
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,860
 just forgetting God, remembering God, forgetting God,

100
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,180
 remembering God, getting ruled over by these other nations.

101
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,220
 And they ran or they're basically,

102
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,300
 the way that the Israelites were governed was a theocracy.

103
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,220
 They would be led by God himself.

104
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,260
 And he would use judges and prophets to speak to them.

105
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,260
 And the very final judge is a guy called Samuel.

106
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,340
 Today we're talking about Samuel's mom.

107
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,060
 And Samuel is a very important one

108
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,820
 because he's the one that takes Israel,

109
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,660
 or God uses to go from theocracy to having a monarchy.

110
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,500
 From leading, being led by God,

111
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,700
 to now being led by a king.

112
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,100
 And Samuel is the one who anoints

113
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,940
 the first king of Israel, King Saul.

114
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,460
 So that's a bit more.

115
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,300
 If I just maybe go a little bit more back

116
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,060
 into who Hannah is, Samuel's mom.

117
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,940
 Samuel's mom, Hannah, is married to a guy called Elkanah.

118
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,660
 Elkanah has two wives, two wives.

119
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,260
 A little bit similar to the sermon

120
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,340
 I gave a couple of weeks back on Leah and Rachel.

121
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,460
 Two wives called Hannah and Penina.

122
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,020
 And it's actually a very familiar story once again.

123
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,580
 One can have babies and one can't.

124
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,340
 Hannah is the one who can't, but is the one who's loved.

125
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,220
 Penina is the one who isn't loved as much,

126
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,340
 but has the babies.

127
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,580
 And again, you see the story wrapped up in envy.

128
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,460
 And that's the, you know what?

129
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,780
 We've been going through this series enough now

130
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,740
 to see that polygamy and barrenness are real things.

131
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,620
 Well, at least in those days.

132
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,820
 The Bible never explicitly says no to polygamy.

133
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,140
 But as you see from the pages of the word of God,

134
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,780
 you see that polygamy is a bad idea.

135
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,300
 And last time I said, having two wives is a bad idea.

136
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,620
 Who would want more than one wife?

137
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,420
 One wife is more than enough, right?

138
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,260
 And the Bible shows us some of the problems

139
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,540
 that come with having two.

140
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,740
 And the topic of barrenness that we see time and time again.

141
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,860
 I want to just give us a little bit more of a glimpse

142
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,540
 of the problem at hand here.

143
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,700
 The struggle that they went through.

144
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,100
 Now, I don't want to be insensitive.

145
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,300
 I don't want to belittle the situation

146
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,260
 that maybe you're going through if you are wanting children.

147
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,820
 Of course, that's a very real thing

148
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,580
 for many, many couples in this day and age.

149
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,340
 And that's very much an emotional need right now.

150
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,540
 Like if a woman's feeling like they want to have a child,

151
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,180
 it's an emotional need, wanting to be maternal,

152
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,100
 wanting a maternal outlet.

153
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,500
 And it's an emotional need.

154
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,660
 But back in those days,

155
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,420
 it actually took on a very different angle.

156
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,100
 It was actually altogether a very different beast.

157
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,340
 And I want to tell you a little bit about why.

158
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,900
 See, when you have children,

159
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,660
 when you had children back then, it meant a couple of things.

160
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,940
 The first thing is this.

161
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,900
 If you have children,

162
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,580
 it means you're increasing your labour force.

163
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,900
 A lot of those days, it's about working the land,

164
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,020
 working the fields, working whatever you have, the animals.

165
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,300
 So the more kids you have, the more people you have working,

166
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,780
 therefore it equals more money.

167
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,180
 And actually, we're not that far removed

168
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,900
 from this kind of line of thinking, culturally, right?

169
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,460
 My dad was the youngest of 16.

170
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,460
 Actually, he eventually became 10.

171
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,060
 And my mum was the second youngest of 11.

172
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,700
 Very much with that kind of mindset.

173
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,540
 The more kids you have,

174
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,260
 the more you can look after the family, and that's one.

175
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,620
 Number two is, as you know,

176
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,420
 Israelites fought a lot of people, surrounding nations.

177
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,660
 The more people you had, the more soldiers you had.

178
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,940
 The more scary you look.

179
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,700
 And finally, of course, medicine back then

180
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,660
 wasn't the same as it now.

181
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,580
 So the success rate of a child growing up to be an adult

182
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,260
 was only about 40%.

183
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,380
 So again, the more kids you have,

184
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,060
 the higher chance you have of a bigger labor force,

185
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,700
 of a bigger army.

186
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,740
 So then you see, if you look at it from that angle,

187
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,980
 you now get to understand what a woman was thinking.

188
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,060
 Because if you were able to have kids,

189
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,580
 you would be deemed a hero.

190
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,620
 If you couldn't have kids, you'd be useless.

191
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,460
 And so that hopefully just gives you a little bit

192
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,900
 of a better picture of the struggle, the turmoil,

193
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,420
 the level of frustration and pain that Hannah had.

194
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,940
 See, what happens is, she goes on this journey

195
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,780
 from being barren to ultimately having Samuel.

196
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,700
 She's going from sorrow to joy.

197
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,060
 And I wanted to go through that,

198
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,940
 'cause I don't know where you're at right now.

199
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,820
 I don't know whether you're struggling

200
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,260
 with sorrow right now,

201
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,580
 or whether you're struggling with waiting for something,

202
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,940
 or there is some pain inside you.

203
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,300
 If there is, I want to tell you that in these words here

204
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,700
 that we're gonna look today,

205
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,300
 we see a template, we see an example

206
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,660
 of how this young woman goes

207
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,540
 from being completely distraught,

208
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,620
 sorrowful, to being filled with joy.

209
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,220
 And I'll go through, and what I want to do

210
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,980
 is map out what the steps were.

211
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,940
 As we look at this passage,

212
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,780
 we won't quite go through verse by verse,

213
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,620
 but as we look at her story, there's only two chapters here,

214
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,380
 we'll be able to see some of the things

215
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,220
 that actually happened.

216
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
 And the next slide is, oh boy, it's already there.

217
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,660
 So she goes from sorrow that leads her to prayer.

218
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,540
 And then from the prayer, it leads her just to surrender,

219
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,220
 and from surrender to worship, and from worship to joy.

220
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,820
 And as we look at this, I pray,

221
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,460
 I pray that the Spirit of the Lord

222
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,900
 will talk and speak into your hearts.

223
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,780
 If there are areas in your life that you are still waiting,

224
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,460
 that you are still frustrated,

225
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,780
 that you are filled with sorrow,

226
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,740
 that you will find encouragement in these words.

227
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,300
 So the first one is this.

228
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,780
 And the verses will come up,

229
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,380
 but I'll read a few of them to you,

230
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,580
 and then I'll call them out.

231
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,540
 So the journey is she goes from sorrow to prayer.

232
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,940
 And we start here at 1 Samuel 1, verse five.

233
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,220
 Actually, we'll go from verse three.

234
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,620
 Now this man used to go up year by year

235
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,620
 from his city to worship.

236
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,060
 This is Elkanah, and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts

237
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,780
 at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli are.

238
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,260
 On the day when Elkanah sacrificed,

239
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,940
 he would give portions to Peninnah, his wife,

240
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,140
 and to all her sons and daughters,

241
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,100
 but to Hannah, verse five here,

242
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,300
 but to Hannah, he gave a double portion

243
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,260
 because he loved her, though the Lord had closed her womb.

244
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,140
 Again, we see something very similar to Rachel here.

245
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,300
 The Lord had not opened her womb.

246
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,500
 She could not have babies,

247
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,780
 but her husband loved her dearly

248
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,460
 and would give her double portion, verse six.

249
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,660
 And her rival used to provoke her grievously

250
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,940
 to irritate her because the Lord had closed her womb.

251
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,980
 So it went on year by year.

252
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,540
 As often as she went up to the house of the Lord,

253
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,420
 she used to provoke her.

254
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,740
 Therefore, Hannah wept and would not eat.

255
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,380
 You see that cycle of envy again

256
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,300
 that we saw in Leah and Rachel.

257
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,420
 You see one wife who could have babies, but wasn't loved,

258
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,780
 but you saw a wife who was loved, but couldn't have babies.

259
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,580
 And you're seeing the same dynamic at play again.

260
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,980
 And hopefully you understand a little bit more

261
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,740
 about the nature of it.

262
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,780
 And verse eight,

263
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,460
 and therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.

264
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,580
 Verse eight, "And Elkanah, her husband, said to her,

265
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,460
 "'Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat?

266
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,140
 "'And why is your heart sad?

267
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,220
 "'Am I not more to you than 10 sons?'"

268
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,340
 When she says, "Why do you weep and why don't you eat?"

269
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,940
 He's actually saying, "Why are you still being resentful?

270
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,860
 "Your existence should be tied to pleasing me.

271
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,340
 "You should find all your satisfaction in me.

272
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,980
 "I'm more than 10 sons to you.

273
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,260
 "Why are you still being resentful?"

274
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,500
 Her husband doesn't seem to get it.

275
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,340
 Verse nine, "After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh,

276
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,780
 "Hannah rose."

277
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,340
 Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat

278
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,180
 beside the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.

279
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,540
 So she's had enough.

280
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,260
 This has happened year after year after year.

281
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,300
 They go up, she gets the double portion,

282
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,060
 Penina gets envious of her, starts to irritate her,

283
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,540
 starts to provoke her, drives her to tears.

284
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,860
 Hannah can no longer eat.

285
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,780
 She doesn't even feel in the mood to eat

286
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,580
 and she is completely distressed.

287
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,380
 And this year is different.

288
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,980
 And this year, verse nine, she says,

289
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,180
 "After they had eaten, she rose."

290
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,500
 The word here isn't very active.

291
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,820
 Well, she's like, "I've had enough of this.

292
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,860
 "That is it.

293
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,900
 "This does not continue."

294
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,780
 And she decides to kind of take matters into her own hands.

295
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,620
 What does she do?

296
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,900
 What's the most radical thing that she could do right now?

297
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,820
 It isn't, of course, to try and get a servant

298
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,140
 to have a baby on her behalf.

299
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,660
 It isn't to eat some plants and some mandrakes

300
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,260
 to try and get a baby.

301
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,380
 She does the most radical thing possible.

302
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,300
 And this is where we should learn.

303
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,260
 She goes to pray.

304
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,700
 In her distress, she goes to pray.

305
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,100
 She heads up to the temple and then she starts to pray.

306
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,420
 Verse 10, "She was deeply distressed

307
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,180
 "and prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly."

308
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,820
 Distressed, deeply distressed and prayed to the Lord

309
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,300
 and wept bitterly.

310
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,620
 See, she takes it to God first.

311
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,380
 She takes it straight to God.

312
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,100
 And it reminds me, when I'm stressed, when I'm distraught,

313
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,540
 in my lowest moment, did I go straight to God?

314
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,700
 Did you go straight to God?

315
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,460
 What are the things that you go to, again,

316
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,580
 when you are distressed?

317
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,140
 Is it God?

318
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,700
 Because if it isn't God, maybe that's where you went wrong.

319
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,580
 Maybe that's where I went wrong.

320
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,620
 Hannah here couldn't take it anymore

321
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,180
 and decides to take action.

322
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,380
 And the only thing she can think of doing

323
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,100
 is going to the temple and praying.

324
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,980
 And it reminds me that sometimes when we're not on form,

325
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,620
 when we are at our lowest, do you feel sometimes

326
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,660
 you find it hard to talk to God?

327
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,700
 I do.

328
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,860
 When I'm really struggling,

329
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,260
 when I'm feeling very sorry for myself,

330
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,540
 I actually find it very hard to talk to God.

331
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,940
 Because maybe there's something about us,

332
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,220
 the way we're built in terms of how we see God.

333
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,700
 We're like, we can only go to God when we are fully right,

334
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,780
 when things are going well.

335
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,580
 We need to present ourselves the best we can to God.

336
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,660
 But then here, it says, actually, no, no, no, no, no.

337
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,740
 You go to God in those moments, when you are the worst.

338
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,620
 God meets you at your ground zero.

339
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,220
 But sometimes we forget that, right?

340
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,940
 But we see it happen time and time again.

341
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,100
 The Psalmist, David, says,

342
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,620
 "God, how long are you going to forsake me?

343
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,780
 "How are you going to forget me?"

344
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,820
 And he's constantly lashing out at God.

345
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,500
 But that's the relationship that the Bible tells us to have.

346
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,340
 And I don't know about you,

347
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,380
 but I feel as though many, many of us here,

348
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,260
 whenever we're upset, whenever we're distressed,

349
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,700
 whenever things aren't going our way,

350
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,220
 the first thing we do is bottle it up.

351
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,100
 We keep it inside.

352
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,940
 And sometimes we don't even have the words to say.

353
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,300
 When you tell me to go to God,

354
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,500
 I don't even know what to say to him.

355
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,540
 I'm so angry.

356
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,380
 I'm so anxious.

357
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,220
 I'm so stressed.

358
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,060
 I'm so depressed.

359
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,340
 I don't even know what to say.

360
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,660
 And actually, we see here that Hannah,

361
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,820
 she manages to get a few words out,

362
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
 but a lot of the time,

363
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,620
 she's only just praying in her heart.

364
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,980
 She's just on, you can imagine her.

365
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,860
 She's in the temple.

366
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,780
 She's on the floor, just weeping bitterly.

367
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,700
 But it reminds us, when we are filled with sorrow,

368
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,100
 when we are distressed, we should go to God.

369
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,140
 There's a verse in 1 Peter that's on the slides here

370
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,220
 that says, "Cast all your anxieties on him

371
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,300
 "because he cares for you."

372
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,500
 Do you genuinely cast your anxieties on him?

373
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,660
 Do you leave them with him?

374
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,780
 When you are at your lowest,

375
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,500
 instead of feeling sorry for yourself,

376
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,980
 or instead of going back to the same things

377
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,740
 where you find comfort in,

378
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,940
 do you think you'd have the strength

379
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,860
 to not stand up before God,

380
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,540
 but to bow down, even in tears,

381
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,180
 even weeping bitterly,

382
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,660
 are you able to do what Hannah does,

383
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,500
 to pray?

384
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,180
 Because that's the beginning.

385
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,060
 If you want to move from sorrow to joy,

386
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,180
 it starts with connecting with God.

387
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,460
 It starts with going to him with all your struggles,

388
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
 with all your anxieties,

389
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,660
 and speaking to him, and letting it all out.

390
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,100
 So, her sorrow leads to prayer.

391
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,860
 But then her prayer leads to surrender.

392
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,980
 And we carry on, verse 11,

393
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,260
 'cause we hear a little bit about what she prays about.

394
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,860
 And she says this, verse 11,

395
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,300
 "And she vowed a vow and said,

396
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
 "'O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed

397
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,740
 "'look on the affliction of your servant

398
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,060
 "'and remember me and not forget your servant,

399
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,980
 "'but will give to your servant a son,

400
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,420
 "'then I will give him to the Lord

401
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,700
 "'all the days of his life,

402
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,980
 "'and no razor shall touch his head.'"

403
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,420
 And that's all we really see.

404
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,820
 The rest of it, he said,

405
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,700
 Scripture tells us that she's only praying in her heart,

406
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,820
 her lips are moving, but we don't know what she's saying.

407
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,740
 So that's the only bit.

408
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
 So we can have a look a little bit

409
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,220
 at what she's saying there.

410
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,060
 "O Lord of hosts."

411
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,980
 Yahweh Sabioth is what the word is.

412
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,580
 It's basically, "O Lord of multitudes,

413
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,540
 "O Lord of armies, O Lord of nations."

414
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,420
 So she's appealing to God,

415
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
 and saying, "You're the only one

416
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,700
 "who can help me.

417
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,340
 "I want a kid, I want a son,

418
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,460
 "and I know that you are the one

419
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,780
 "who promised all of our people just multitudes.

420
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,460
 "O Lord of multitudes, can you remember me?

421
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,300
 "Can you look at me?

422
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,700
 "Can you remind me how much you care?"

423
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,460
 And then she does a strange thing.

424
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,420
 She says, "If you just give me a servant, a son,

425
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,780
 "then I will give him to the Lord

426
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,500
 "all the days of his life,

427
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,020
 "and no razor shall touch his head."

428
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,980
 Just give me a son, please.

429
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
 I'll give him back to you,

430
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,780
 and I promise to never cut his hair.

431
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,540
 Isn't that a bit weird?

432
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,500
 So a little bit of the context here is,

433
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,140
 there were 12 tribes of Israel, right?

434
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,700
 One of the tribes were very special.

435
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,540
 One of the tribes were actually

436
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,660
 almost designated to be full-time ministers,

437
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,260
 the Levites.

438
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,540
 So these guys, the tribe of Levi,

439
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,060
 the people there, wouldn't get any land.

440
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,780
 Their job was to serve in ministry

441
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,300
 to the other tribes,

442
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,660
 and they would basically be supported

443
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
 by the other tribes.

444
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,780
 Isn't that a little weird?

445
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,660
 But anyway, that's how you were in full-time ministry

446
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,540
 if you were born into a Levite family.

447
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,900
 But if you wanted to go into full-time ministry,

448
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,060
 and you were part of the other tribes,

449
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,260
 you could do something.

450
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,060
 You could commit to being a Nazirite.

451
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,100
 Samson was a Nazirite.

452
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,580
 That's why he couldn't cut his hair

453
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,300
 until he met Delilah and he screwed up his life.

454
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,460
 But that's Samson.

455
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,260
 So it's two things that you have to be

456
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,300
 in order to be a Nazirite,

457
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,980
 to be in full-time ministry if you're not a Levite.

458
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,620
 First, you're not allowed to cut your hair,

459
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,340
 and second, you're not allowed to drink strong wine.

460
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,420
 So those are two things.

461
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,500
 And then there are other things,

462
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,540
 but those are the two key ones

463
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,060
 that I'll just highlight today.

464
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,460
 So what she's saying is this.

465
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,580
 If you give me a son, I'll give him back to you,

466
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,340
 and he will serve you all the days of his life.

467
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,940
 And you see, serving in full-time ministry

468
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,660
 was not, hey, he can still come home

469
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,500
 and hang out with me,

470
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,340
 and I can still care for him.

471
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,180
 No, no, no.

472
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,780
 If she was to do this,

473
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,020
 she would say goodbye to him

474
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,180
 when he was three years old.

475
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,940
 And then she would give him off to the temple,

476
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,980
 and that would be it.

477
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,900
 And there's no WhatsApp, there's no FaceTime.

478
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,860
 Like, you give away your three-year-old,

479
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,220
 and then that's it.

480
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,060
 They're gone.

481
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,980
 Can you understand the gravity

482
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,660
 of what she did in that prayer,

483
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,420
 given what I just told you earlier

484
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,860
 about what it meant for a woman to have a baby?

485
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,980
 She's saying, if you would only give me a child,

486
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,940
 I will give him back to you,

487
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,140
 and I won't reap any of the benefits

488
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,540
 that a woman would have if she was to become a mother.

489
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,380
 When all the other mothers are hanging around

490
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,220
 outside school, picking up their kids,

491
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,180
 she won't be there.

492
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,940
 Her son wouldn't be there.

493
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,260
 When all the women are looking at their kids,

494
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,260
 growing strong, and joining to be part of the labour force,

495
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,820
 working the field, or even protecting their people,

496
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,380
 her son would not be there.

497
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,300
 She's basically giving up all the benefits

498
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,500
 and all the goals of having a kid.

499
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,820
 So basically, she's surrendering it all back to God.

500
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,140
 There would be no helping of the family's business.

501
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,300
 Economically, it wouldn't make any sense at all.

502
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,980
 Territorially, it wouldn't make sense.

503
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,340
 They wouldn't be able to help in any way.

504
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,260
 Yeah, here's the thing,

505
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,020
 'cause not only does she want a kid for an emotional reason,

506
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,220
 or an economical reason, or a territorial reason,

507
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,100
 she also wanted one for a theological reason.

508
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,140
 Why?

509
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,540
 Because the women of Israel knew about the promise

510
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,020
 that God made, saying that your nation is just gonna grow.

511
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,460
 So they knew that every time they could have a kid,

512
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,340
 they would be part of God's salvation plan.

513
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,300
 There would be something special

514
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,660
 that they would be part of.

515
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,180
 So you can see here, she was recognising in her prayer

516
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,780
 that it wasn't necessarily about what she wanted,

517
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,620
 but she was wanting to give it back to God.

518
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,860
 It reminds me of the Psalmist.

519
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,140
 In Psalm 37, it says, "Delight in the Lord,

520
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,700
 "and he will grant you the desires of your heart."

521
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,940
 It makes me think, when I pray to God,

522
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,340
 when I'm wanting something from him,

523
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,300
 when I'm praying, I'm literally just praying

524
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,420
 for him to give me that thing.

525
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,180
 I'm treating him very much like a vending machine.

526
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,300
 But is that the point of prayer?

527
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,020
 Is that what Hannah did here?

528
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,380
 Yes, she did want a child,

529
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,980
 but in her delight of the Lord,

530
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,140
 he then grants her the desires of her heart

531
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,500
 because she showed him that for her, it was still about him.

532
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,220
 And so what we see here then,

533
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,580
 that actually prayer shows what our heart is really about.

534
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,700
 If someone who doesn't know God or Christianity

535
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,980
 or church life or anything at all

536
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,940
 sat in your private prayers with God,

537
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,260
 what kind of image would they have of God?

538
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,340
 If they listened to your prayers

539
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,140
 about what you ask God for,

540
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,700
 and they were to draw a picture

541
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,020
 of who they thought God is based on your prayer,

542
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,300
 what kind of God would they come up with?

543
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,460
 It's an interesting question.

544
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,140
 And you see, Hannah's prayer here shows that

545
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,540
 it wasn't just, "Oh, just give it me.

546
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,460
 "I just want him for a little bit."

547
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,100
 She was willing to give it all to God.

548
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,220
 It's interesting.

549
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,100
 It's important for us to think about.

550
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,940
 Now, I've been in Hong Kong for two and a half years now

551
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,100
 with my family.

552
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,940
 It's crazy, right?

553
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,740
 It's been the most peaceful, tranquil time.

554
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,100
 I remember when we were first wrestling with God

555
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,380
 about coming to Hong Kong, and we were praying.

556
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,860
 We're like, "God, seriously,

557
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,660
 "do you really want us to do this?

558
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,580
 "To come from the UK to Hong Kong?

559
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,060
 "Everyone seems to be going in the opposite direction.

560
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,220
 "Why don't we, okay, you know what?

561
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,060
 "We'll pray about it.

562
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,380
 "You know, God, just, just, just, yeah,

563
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,540
 "just your will be done,

564
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,140
 "but it probably should be somewhere in the UK.

565
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,980
 "Oh, Toronto.

566
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,740
 "Toronto would be a good place.

567
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,620
 "The food there is just as good as Hong Kong,

568
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,820
 "but there's more space.

569
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,260
 "We wouldn't live in a box."

570
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,860
 And I found, halfway through my prayers,

571
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,860
 it was me asking God to grant me the desires of my heart.

572
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,620
 But that's not the point of prayer, right?

573
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,780
 The point of prayer is, can you get yourself to a point

574
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,380
 to surrender to God, like Hannah did, and say,

575
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,220
 "You know what?

576
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,380
 "This is what I want, but it's all for you.

577
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,900
 "Everything I have, I wanna give back to you."

578
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,740
 Her prayer leads her to surrender.

579
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,100
 How do you surrender yourself?

580
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,500
 As you pray, as you discern about the decisions

581
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,980
 in your life, the things that you want,

582
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,620
 the things that you want removed,

583
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,940
 is your prayer filled with surrender?

584
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,500
 Does your prayer truly reflect the nature of God?

585
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,700
 Sorrow leads to prayer.

586
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,340
 Prayer leads to surrender.

587
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,180
 And surrender leads to worship.

588
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,020
 And we carry on.

589
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,900
 So we see her praying this prayer, still weeping bitterly,

590
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,060
 and then she starts praying, and verse 12,

591
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,500
 I don't think they put this up here,

592
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,740
 she continues praying, Eli the priest sees her

593
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,820
 and observes her mouth, verse 13,

594
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,140
 "Hannah was speaking in her heart,

595
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,500
 "only her lips moved and her voice was not heard."

596
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,020
 And then verse 14, "And Eli says to her,

597
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,620
 "'How long will you go on being drunk?

598
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,940
 "'Put your wine away from you.'

599
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,820
 "But Hannah answered, 'No, my Lord,

600
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,380
 "'I am a woman troubled in spirit.

601
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
 "'I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,

602
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,620
 "'but I've been pouring out my soul before the Lord.'"

603
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,620
 Verse 16, "Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman,

604
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,180
 "for all along I've been speaking out

605
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,540
 "of my great anxiety and vexation."

606
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,020
 So she's praying, and there's no words coming out her mouth,

607
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,940
 she's probably just a babbling mess.

608
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,100
 And the priest who's sitting beside is going,

609
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,780
 "What is wrong with you?

610
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,060
 "Just sort yourself out, stop drinking,

611
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,260
 "well, one, just get out and sort yourself out."

612
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,940
 But she's like, "No, that's not what I'm doing.

613
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,860
 "I am so distraught.

614
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,220
 "I am pouring out my soul to the Lord.

615
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,300
 "I've been filled with all this anxiety,

616
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,300
 "all this vexation, all this anger, this frustration."

617
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,980
 And Eli's like, "Oh, sorry, sorry,

618
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,300
 "I totally did not understand that,

619
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,260
 "I did not see that."

620
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
 And then he says, "Just go in peace,

621
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,100
 "and the God of Israel grant your petition

622
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,820
 "that you have made to him."

623
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,740
 He's not saying, "Hey, I prophetically claim,

624
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,860
 "proclaim that this prayer will be answered."

625
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,540
 No, he's just kind of saying, "Go in peace, God bless you."

626
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
 It's more like that.

627
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,300
 And then she says, verse 18,

628
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,820
 "And let your servant find favour in your eyes.

629
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,180
 "Then the woman," here's the key, verse 18,

630
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,060
 "Then the woman went her way and ate,

631
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,220
 "and her face was no longer sad."

632
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,020
 Her mindset changed before anything happened,

633
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,980
 before any circumstance changed.

634
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,780
 Isn't that weird?

635
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,940
 She went from not being able to eat

636
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,860
 and deeply distressed and weeping bitterly,

637
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,980
 to having a face that was no longer sad,

638
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,540
 and now she was willing to eat.

639
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,940
 What I see here is that the point of prayer

640
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,660
 is not to change your circumstance,

641
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,620
 not to grant you the wish, the desires of your heart,

642
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,580
 the point of prayer in this scenario is to change you.

643
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,900
 Hannah was changed simply because of the process

644
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,860
 of pouring out her soul to the Lord.

645
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,740
 Again, it's not about getting our wishes granted.

646
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,940
 This is not Will Smith in "Aladdin", the genie.

647
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,500
 God is not the genie.

648
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 And if someone's listening to your prayers

649
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
 and thinking that God's just the genie,

650
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,900
 there's something very wrong.

651
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,780
 But I can tell you, sometimes my prayers,

652
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,540
 "God bless this food, thank you.

653
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,980
 "Can you make sure tomorrow is good?

654
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,580
 "Can you help it to stop raining?"

655
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,460
 And then it sounds like I'm praying to a genie.

656
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,260
 But here we see that through her prayer,

657
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,340
 Hannah is completely transformed.

658
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,180
 And it reminds me of this.

659
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,820
 As we evaluate our prayers,

660
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,940
 and maybe we're all thinking about our prayers now,

661
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,740
 is God truly the agenda in our prayers?

662
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,580
 Or do we have our own agenda

663
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,060
 and we're asking God to fulfil them?

664
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,060
 God, we want to do this, but God, can you help me get there?

665
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,780
 Rather than, "God, I want to get where you are."

666
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,820
 And it reminds me again, the psalmist just says this,

667
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,380
 and yet he's the one who's always pouring out, David.

668
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,700
 And he's saying, "Psalm 27, there's only one thing I ask,

669
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,060
 "and there's only one thing I seek,

670
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,300
 "that I would dwell in the presence of the Most High

671
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,700
 "all the days of my life.

672
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,180
 "That's the only thing.

673
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,500
 "May all my prayer requests revolve around that.

674
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,020
 "May everything I ask for from you, God,

675
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,340
 "be essentially about you."

676
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,740
 And so when we pray, do we have that?

677
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,820
 Do we have that surrender,

678
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,460
 and that ultimately leads us to worship?

679
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,780
 You see, after that, verse 19, I don't think it's on there,

680
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,500
 they rose, after she prays, and then she's willing to eat,

681
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,660
 and her face is no longer sad, verse 19,

682
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,860
 they rose early in the morning and worshipped before the Lord.

683
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,860
 That prayer that started with sorrow,

684
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,540
 that continued with surrender, ended up in worship.

685
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,260
 Because she prayed, because she poured out,

686
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,180
 because she spent time with the Most High God,

687
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,940
 it drove her to worship.

688
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,620
 And we're starting to see now,

689
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,900
 if we're wondering how do we get from sorrow to joy,

690
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,340
 we're starting to see the trail that needs to happen,

691
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,820
 the process that needs to happen.

692
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,460
 It's truly, "Your will be done,

693
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,020
 "not God, can you help my will be done?"

694
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,100
 I'm reminded of the Apostle Paul, Philippians, chapter four,

695
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,700
 says, "Don't be anxious about anything."

696
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,300
 Don't be anxious about anything,

697
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,140
 but in everything, by prayer and supplication,

698
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,940
 present your request to God.

699
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,820
 But I missed a word out there, with thanksgiving.

700
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,980
 So as we pray, it should lead us to worship,

701
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,020
 it should lead us to a point of gratitude,

702
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,220
 because it's only when we have gratitude

703
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,220
 do we truly know that we're not praying

704
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,460
 out of selfish desires.

705
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,340
 When we are able to be like,

706
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,860
 "God, I am so content in you, I am so thankful for you."

707
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,060
 And then you will go from being anxious

708
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,860
 to having this peace that transcends all understanding.

709
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,580
 Look at your prayer again, look at your prayers again.

710
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,540
 Does it lead you to a place of worship?

711
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,100
 Does it lead you, is it filled with gratitude?

712
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,860
 Is it filled with thanksgiving?

713
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,540
 Delight in the Lord,

714
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,300
 and He will grant you the desires of your heart.

715
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,340
 Brothers and sisters, I encourage you to pray,

716
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,100
 as you pray, even in your distress,

717
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,180
 it is still possible to count the blessings

718
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,340
 that God has given.

719
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,260
 It is still possible to be thankful,

720
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,940
 and I know it often doesn't feel like that,

721
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,220
 but it must be like that.

722
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,700
 Scripture tells us to rejoice,

723
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,060
 to rejoice always, continually,

724
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,140
 but that is so, so hard.

725
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,340
 We are a grumpy people, we like to complain, right?

726
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,580
 We love complaining,

727
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,140
 but Scripture tells us you've got to rejoice,

728
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,580
 and it is a choice to rejoice.

729
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,380
 You have to make that choice to do it.

730
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,060
 And finally, you will get to a point where your worship

731
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,500
 will then lead to joy.

732
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,060
 So then they go home, verse 20,

733
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,780
 "And in due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son,

734
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,020
 "and she called his name Samuel,

735
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,620
 "for she said, 'I have asked for him from the Lord.'"

736
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,740
 And then the story jumps a little bit,

737
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,860
 because from there, verse 21,

738
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,060
 "The man, Alkenah, and all his house went up to offer

739
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,500
 "to the Lord the yearly sacrifice to pay his vow."

740
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,060
 So this continues, this guy is a disciplined man,

741
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,420
 so he keeps going every year,

742
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,980
 but for the next two, three years,

743
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,300
 Hannah doesn't go with him,

744
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,460
 because now she has baby Samuel.

745
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,140
 And she tells him, "You guys go,

746
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,140
 "because I have to look after baby."

747
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,180
 That's number one, 'cause everyone knows

748
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,060
 how hard it is to travel with a baby.

749
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,420
 But also, I know that when the time is right,

750
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,780
 I have to take Samuel myself.

751
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,860
 When he's three years old, I'm gonna take him myself,

752
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,660
 and I'm gonna leave him there for the rest of his life.

753
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,540
 Verse 22, "But Hannah did not go up,

754
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,580
 "for she said to her husband,

755
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,020
 "'As soon as the child is weaned,

756
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,740
 "'I will bring him so that he may appear

757
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,580
 "'in the presence of the Lord and dwell there forever.'"

758
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,740
 Fast forward a little bit, verse 27,

759
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,820
 "For this child I prayed,

760
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,380
 "and the Lord has granted me my petition

761
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,260
 "that I made to him.

762
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,580
 "Therefore I have lent him to the Lord,

763
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
 "as long as he lives, he is lent to the Lord."

764
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,780
 So when he turns three, she goes with him.

765
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,820
 She travels and leaves him there.

766
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,020
 Every year, she does pop back

767
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,140
 and gives him some jackets to wear.

768
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,180
 That's what every mom does, (speaks in foreign language)

769
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,740
 and just wear more clothes.

770
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,700
 But that's it.

771
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,700
 Imagine how you're feeling if you're Hannah right now.

772
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,380
 You've gone through this whole journey,

773
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,980
 being provoked for years,

774
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,180
 not having a kid, finally having one.

775
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,580
 And then three years later, you give him away,

776
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,020
 and you go back to where you were.

777
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,220
 What would you be like if that happened to you?

778
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,980
 Let's say you were good enough

779
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,220
 to honour your commitment to God,

780
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,740
 and you still gave the child back.

781
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,460
 I don't think I, I mean, I think I would struggle.

782
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,620
 I'd be like, "Well, did I really say that?

783
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,180
 "Did I really promise that I'll give him back to you?

784
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,260
 "Did I sign a contract?

785
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
 "I don't think I signed a contract."

786
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,380
 And there wasn't a notary involved.

787
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,940
 But yet here we are, we see Hannah does it,

788
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,500
 and then she does the most radical thing again.

789
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,340
 After gaining her child and then losing her child,

790
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,580
 chapter two, and Hannah prayed.

791
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,780
 So after going through this whole journey

792
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,780
 and giving up this beloved boy to the ministry,

793
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,060
 instead of being heartbroken,

794
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,020
 instead of being frustrated,

795
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,180
 instead of being sad,

796
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,860
 all Scripture tells us here is, "And then she prayed."

797
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,820
 And it's through this prayer

798
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
 we get to see a little bit into her heart,

799
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,980
 and we get to understand a little bit.

800
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,460
 And this is where my final point is,

801
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,300
 where worship leads to joy,

802
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,860
 that she is genuinely in a place of joy.

803
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,420
 Chapter two, verse one, "And Hannah prayed and said,

804
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,900
 "My heart exalts in the Lord.

805
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,260
 "My horn is exalted in the Lord."

806
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,660
 Horn back then represented strength, it was strength.

807
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,980
 "My horn is exalted in the Lord.

808
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,260
 "My mouth provides my enemies

809
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,100
 "because I rejoice in your salvation."

810
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,380
 She says, "With all my heart, with all my mouth,

811
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,860
 "with all my strength, I praise the Lord.

812
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,780
 "I lift him up to you."

813
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,140
 Would you be doing that if you gave up your child?

814
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,940
 I don't think, I don't know, I think it would be hard.

815
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,140
 I don't think I would.

816
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,780
 Yet you see now, it's revealed that Hannah's heart

817
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,460
 was not idolising family.

818
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,220
 You see that she, the only God that she worshipped

819
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,260
 was God himself, and that she was willing

820
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,580
 to honour her commitment and give her son back.

821
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,620
 And then she goes through this,

822
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,700
 and we won't go through every verse,

823
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,420
 and this song that she sings, or this prayer that she prays

824
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,300
 has really a key theme here.

825
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,580
 And the key theme is this, man, God uses imperfect people

826
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,700
 to carry out his perfect plan.

827
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,820
 You know what, everything isn't quite as it seems.

828
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,700
 It seems as though the kingdom of heaven

829
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,380
 operates with some upside down values.

830
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,220
 It seems counterintuitive to how society operates right here.

831
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,220
 How, verse four, "The bows of the mighty are broken,

832
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,860
 "but the feeble bind on strength.

833
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,300
 "Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,

834
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,540
 "but those who are hungry have ceased to hunger.

835
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,700
 "The baron has borne seven,

836
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,860
 "but she who has many children is forlorn.

837
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,580
 "The Lord kills and brings to life.

838
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,940
 "He brings down to Sheol and raises up.

839
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,700
 "The Lord makes poor and makes rich.

840
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,140
 "He brings low and He exalts.

841
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,900
 "He raises up the poor from the dust.

842
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,420
 "He lifts the needy from the ash heap

843
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,140
 "to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honour."

844
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,700
 She's saying there's something different about this God.

845
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,140
 He turns the world upside down.

846
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,380
 He used me.

847
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,660
 I could never have had a kid without God,

848
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,860
 and yet here He is.

849
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,980
 He used me somehow in my weakness to become His strength.

850
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:58,260
 In this whole ordeal, all she could think about was God,

851
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,020
 and all she could think about was how different He is

852
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,740
 to how the things are in this world.

853
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,180
 And you look at this prayer,

854
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,540
 and it reminds you of a very similar prayer

855
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,660
 many, many years later.

856
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,500
 Which prayer is that?

857
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,100
 Do we know?

858
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,380
 Similarly, again, a miracle conception.

859
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,700
 Many, many years later,

860
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,700
 Mary, the mother of Jesus, sings a very similar prayer.

861
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,140
 In fact, Mary's prayer is based on Hannah's one.

862
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,180
 And again, it's the same theme.

863
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,740
 If you look at it, if you go into the Gospels to look at it,

864
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,940
 Mary is praying about the same thing again,

865
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,140
 that the mighty will be brought down,

866
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,420
 that the humble will be exalted,

867
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,100
 that the world will be turned and flipped upside down.

868
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:47,900
 And similarly, another miracle conception happens.

869
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,060
 But before I talk about it,

870
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,900
 you carry on towards the end of Hannah's song.

871
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
 Chapter two, verse 10.

872
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,620
 The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken.

873
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,340
 This is where she finishes her prayer.

874
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,260
 The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces.

875
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,220
 Against them He will thunder in heaven.

876
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,300
 The Lord will judge the ends of the earth.

877
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,580
 He will, here's the key word,

878
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,300
 He will give strength to His King

879
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,100
 and exalt the horn of His anointed.

880
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,340
 Sounds typical of a Psalm that we kind of read

881
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,220
 and sing right.

882
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,260
 But do you not realise that at this point,

883
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,220
 there was no King?

884
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,780
 They were ruled by judges.

885
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,420
 In fact, her son will be the last judge.

886
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,140
 But what King was she talking about?

887
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,100
 She would have had no way of knowing.

888
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,860
 So why is she talking about a King?

889
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
 Verse 10 here again,

890
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,340
 and He will give strength to His King.

891
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,620
 Of course, Samuel, baby Samuel,

892
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,020
 ends up growing up to be prophet Samuel

893
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,780
 and ends up anointing Israel's first King Saul.

894
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,620
 So you can see that God is using her

895
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,820
 for a much bigger plan.

896
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,300
 And then the final words,

897
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,860
 and exalt the horn of His anointed.

898
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,380
 The word anointed there means Messiah.

899
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:59,340
 In this humble prayer from this woman

900
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,500
 that was used by the Lord,

901
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,020
 she points to a Messiah, the anointed one.

902
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,860
 The one who would turn and preach

903
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,380
 about a kingdom of heaven that is upside down

904
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,300
 in His values.

905
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,220
 You look at the Beatitudes,

906
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,900
 you look at His sermon.

907
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,020
 He's always talking about it,

908
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,620
 blessed are the poor,

909
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,460
 blessed are the meek.

910
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,220
 They're the ones that are going to inherit the earth.

911
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,820
 He preached this upside down kingdom

912
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,540
 that Hannah prayed about.

913
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,380
 He preached,

914
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,740
 He says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me

915
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,460
 to proclaim good news to the poor,

916
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,260
 to the oppressed, to the captives, to the blind."

917
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,140
 He preached that same message,

918
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,180
 but it wasn't just that,

919
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,020
 He also lived it.

920
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,100
 In the cross, He turns the world upside down.

921
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,860
 And He showed us that

922
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,980
 that's how you go from sorrow to joy.

923
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,940
 He Himself was very distressed at certain points.

924
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,780
 He Himself was filled with sorrow.

925
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,740
 Think about the moment when He was in the garden

926
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,700
 and He's just, "God, you know what?

927
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,020
 This is Jesus.

928
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,980
 If you would just remove this cup of suffering from me,

929
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,700
 do it, please."

930
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,620
 He's bleeding, sweating blood.

931
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,380
 And in His sorrow, what does He do?

932
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,620
 He goes to God.

933
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,820
 He talks to God.

934
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,580
 His sorrow leads Him to prayer.

935
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,820
 And then His prayer leads Him to surrender.

936
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,460
 Jesus Christ Himself then said,

937
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,300
 "You know what?

938
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,340
 Remove this cup of suffering,

939
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,180
 but may your will be done and not mine."

940
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,380
 You see Him take it to God,

941
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,580
 but then ultimately surrender to God.

942
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,860
 And He Himself gets to that point

943
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,820
 where He surrenders and sacrifices Himself.

944
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,980
 And He, in this prayer here, verse six,

945
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,220
 "The Lord kills and brings to life.

946
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,540
 He brings down to Sheol."

947
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,140
 Sheol is a place where the dead lived.

948
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,940
 So He Himself goes down to Sheol,

949
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,260
 but then He is raised up.

950
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,020
 He is the one who defeats death.

951
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,900
 He is the one that ushers in this upside down kingdom.

952
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,220
 And He's the one here who's wanting us

953
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,380
 to turn our lives upside down.

954
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,740
 So that we, when we are faced with sorrow,

955
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,580
 when we are walking through the valley

956
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,540
 of the shadow of death,

957
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,220
 we will fear no evil because He is with us,

958
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,260
 because He did it.

959
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,540
 He overcame it.

960
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:29,060
 So you see the story of Hannah here points us to Jesus.

961
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,860
 The story of Hannah here,

962
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,300
 where we see her go from sorrow to joy,

963
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,140
 points us to Jesus because that's exactly what He did.

964
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,700
 In fact, all the women in the Old Testament

965
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,740
 that we've been going through tell us one thing,

966
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,420
 that this Messiah, this Jesus, this King,

967
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,220
 wasn't just the anointed King,

968
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,020
 but He was also a suffering servant.

969
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,220
 That He also went from here to here.

970
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,460
 And I'll finish with this verse here from John 16.

971
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,220
 John 16, verse 22.

972
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,340
 Jesus Himself says this.

973
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,420
 "So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again,

974
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,460
 "and your hearts will rejoice,

975
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,740
 "and no one will take your joy from you.

976
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,500
 "In that day you will ask nothing of Me.

977
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,620
 "Truly, truly, I say to you,

978
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,340
 "whatever you ask of the Father in My name,

979
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,580
 "He will give it to you."

980
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,140
 You have sorrow now, brothers and sisters.

981
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,100
 Maybe you are walking right in it and right through it.

982
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,500
 But Jesus Himself is saying,

983
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,540
 "But I will see you again.

984
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,260
 "And when I see you, your hearts will rejoice,

985
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,140
 "because by then everything will be made new,

986
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,660
 "because by then every tear will be wiped away,

987
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,980
 "because by then there will be no more pain.

988
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,780
 "There will be no more other ways

989
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,620
 "to deal with your distress and sorrow,

990
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,820
 "because by then it will all be gone.

991
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,940
 "And I will bring all things to restoration.

992
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,500
 "By then, in that day you will ask nothing of Me,

993
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,700
 "because there will be nothing that you need.

994
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,300
 "Your prayers won't be about

995
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,580
 "asking a genie for different things.

996
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,420
 "Your prayer will just be basking in His glory

997
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,500
 "and in His beauty.

998
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,420
 "And you will have the one thing that you asked,

999
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,260
 "for the one thing that you've seeked,

1000
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,020
 "to be able to be with Him."

1001
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,340
 So I just want to finish with this as an encouragement,

1002
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,780
 and we'll ask the band to come back up now.

1003
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,100
 I don't know where you're at,

1004
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:33,100
 and I can only imagine that everyone has their struggles,

1005
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,620
 but I want us just to spend a few minutes now

1006
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,180
 just to pray.

1007
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,140
 So if we would just, maybe bow our heads

1008
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,700
 and close our eyes.

1009
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,700
 (audience laughing)

1010
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:50,900
 And as we reflect on this story of Hannah,

1011
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,260
 where she struggled through so much,

1012
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,700
 where she herself walked through

1013
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,420
 the valley of the shadow of death,

1014
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,420
 that she rose and took it to the Lord.

1015
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,660
 And so I'm praying here,

1016
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,020
 if there is anyone who is in that place of deep sorrow,

1017
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,580
 that deep distress,

1018
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:20,420
 I encourage you to rely on the things of this world no more.

1019
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,340
 Don't go back to the same things that you think will help.

1020
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,220
 Go to Him.

1021
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,180
 And pour out your soul to Him.

1022
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,860
 And I pray that that sorrow that leads you to prayer

1023
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,060
 will bring you to a place of surrender.

1024
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:43,060
 That you would know that He is the only one

1025
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,700
 who can satisfy the yearnings and the cravings of your heart.

1026
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,580
 And I pray that He'd give you the strength

1027
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,300
 to find delight in Him,

1028
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,900
 to be filled with thanksgiving and gratitude.

1029
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,500
 (gentle music)

1030
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,740
 And that surrender will lead you to a place of peace

1031
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,220
 and a place of worship.

1032
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,740
 So that no matter what happens,

1033
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,260
 whether your circumstance changes or not,

1034
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:17,020
 you will be able to worship and you will be filled with joy.

1035
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,540
 And may you be given the chance

1036
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,620
 to meet Jesus face to face even now.

1037
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:29,100
 And when you see Him,

1038
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,060
 everything else will pale in comparison.

1039
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,860
 (gentle music)

1040
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,420
 Because He is your shepherd and you shall not want.

1041
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,180
 So even though you walk through the valley

1042
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,060
 of the shadow of death,

1043
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,940
 you will fear no evil for He is with you.

1044
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:58,900
 So Father, I pray that you would instill in all of us

1045
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,420
 a spirit of worship,

1046
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,340
 despite and regardless of our circumstances,

1047
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,340
 that we would be able to praise you

1048
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,020
 even in the midst of the storm,

1049
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,260
 and that you would grant us peace

1050
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,620
 and you would grant us joy.

1051
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,380
 It's in your name we pray, amen.

1052
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:30,380
