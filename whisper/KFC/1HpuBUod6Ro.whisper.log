[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Now let's pass the time to Pastor James for scripture reading.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Isaiah 58, true and false fasting.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Cry aloud, do not hold back.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Lift up your voice like a trumpet and declare to my people their transgression.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   To the house of Jacob their sins.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   as if they were a nation that did righteousness
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   and did not forsake the judgment of their God.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   They ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Why have we fasted and you see it not?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Why have we humbled ourselves and you take no knowledge of it?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   and oppress all your workers.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Is it such the fast that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Is it to bow down his head like a reed and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the Lord?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Is not this the fast that I choose, to loose the bonds of wickedness,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless pouring to your house?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   When you see the naked, to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   then shall your light break forth like the dawn and your healing shall spring up speedily.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Your righteousness shall go before you.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   The glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Then you shall call and the Lord will answer.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   You shall cry and he will say, 'Here I am.'
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   If you take away the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And the Lord will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scattered places
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and make your bones strong.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You shall raise up the foundations of many generations.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   You shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to dwell in.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   This is the word of the Lord.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And now I'd like to pass the time over to Pastor John to give us the word.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Hi Church. I'm so excited about what God is doing in our church and in our city.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The combined service last week really touched my heart.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And I know for many of you too.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And Johnny's already told us that the Church of Hong Kong is going to join together as one
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   to fast for our city.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We fast for two reasons.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   One, we love Hong Kong.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And secondly, we love God.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And it is so good that we as Gong Fuk Church are joining together.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Three congregations, English, Cantonese and Mandarin,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   to do a devotional together and to pray together on the day of Pentecost.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I remember very few church sermons on fasting.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   In some quarters, fasting has been tarred with a brush of legalism.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Maybe a reaction to abuses over the centuries.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   But I believe that that has caused the church to forfeit an intimacy with God
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   that is rightfully ours.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So let's put that right.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Following the combined service, I believe this church and the Church of Hong Kong
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   is preparing the ground to step into a new season.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I know I say this every week, but I for one am excited.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Now, since Jesus is our role model, let's look at the first works of Jesus
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   in Luke chapter 4.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I start from verse 1.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   where for forty days he was tempted by the devil.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Jesus was hungry.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Note, not thirsty.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Therefore, it's safe to conclude that for forty days he only drank water.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Now note, he was full of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit before being driven into the wilderness.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And we know the story.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   He withstood Satan's temptations.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But how could he do it?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Forty days, just drinking water.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Luke 4.14 will let you into the secret.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Luke tells us Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Now note the difference.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Verse 1, Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Verse 14, after forty days of fasting, where he defeated Satan,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   he was operating in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I believe this is very important to us as we approach the Feast of Pentecost.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Church, there is a clear difference between being filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and operating in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Something transformed Jesus from being a spirit-filled man
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   to a man walking in the power of the Spirit.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   What about us?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   For us, being filled with the Spirit does not mean that we are ready to move
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   in the fullness of our calling or power in God.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   We need to submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   During that time, God will disciple us in prayer, in fasting,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   in skillful use of his Word.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   The result is this, we are released in the power of the Holy Spirit to do his will.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Fasting is, we believe, an important key to go beyond the infilling of the Spirit
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   to tap the power of the Spirit for us and for our church.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   The aim of this sermon is that we all clearly see that fasting
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   helps release the power of God in our lives.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Now let's be careful.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Fasting does not earn any more of the grace of God.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   But we contend it does facilitate the flowing of the Spirit
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   through the dissolving, the removing of the junk in our lives.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Fasting is one of the most misunderstood subjects in the whole Bible.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And that's sad, as the Bible tells us of the incredible benefits.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Fasting is mentioned more than 50 times in the Bible.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Isaiah chapter 58, which James just read, is a chapter on fasting.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   We suggest you read that chapter and meditate on it.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Now the background is Isaiah is warning the Israelites, don't abuse fasting.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   He says, "You said, 'Why have we fasted?' they said, 'and you've not seen it.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Why have you humbled ourselves and you haven't noticed?'"
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And they say, "God, I've been fasting. Weren't you watching?"
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   God says on the day of your fasting, you do as you please.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   You exploit all your workers.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Your fasting ends in quarrelling and strife and in striking each other with wicked feasts.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Strong words.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   God then lists 12 blessings of the fast I have chosen.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I repeat, I invite you to read Isaiah 58.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   We will be doing so as a church during our devotional.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   It talks about revelation, healing and wholeness, righteousness, the presence of God, answered prayer,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   continued guidance, contentment, strength, refreshing like a spring, work that endures,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   raising up of the future generations and restorations.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I like that.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   But what I want to focus on this evening is the question, "Why?"
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Why do we fast?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I'm going to give you 9 good reasons to fast.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Firstly, we fast in obedience to God's word.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Fasting is deeply ingrained in God's word.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's mentioned 56 times, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   It is a tool of successful leaders.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Samuel 2.12 says, "Even now, declares the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning."
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And there are many other biblical references.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Secondly, we fast to humble ourselves before God and to obtain His grace and His power.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   James 4.10 says, "Humble yourself before the Lord and He will lift you up."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Fasting is humbling yourself before God to overcome temptations in areas that stop us moving into God's power.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Jesus did it in the wilderness.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   So can we.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Thirdly, we fast to overcome temptations in areas that stop us moving into God's power.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Do you have these?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I do.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Is there anyone here who doesn't?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   What are your barriers?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Let's go back to Luke 4.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Jesus in the wilderness, tempted by the devil.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   What did He do? Fast.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   The result? He came out in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   He whipped the devil and came forth in power.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   So can we.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   We fast to become unentangled from sin and to help others to do so.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Jesus took away all the sins of the world at Calvary.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yet many of us have to deal with entangling sins that pop up time and time again.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Church, God not only wants to defeat those in our lives, but He wants us to stand in the gap as intercessors for others.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   If there is a habit or a chronic sin, He wants us to take on the sin of others.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   You remember Daniel chapter 9.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with Him in prayer and petition, in fasting and in sackcloth and ashes.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Oh Lord, the great and awesome God who keeps His covenant of love with all who love Him and obey His commands.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   We have sinned and done wrong.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   We have been wicked and have rebelled.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   We have turned away from Your commands and laws.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Remember the man that prayed this prayer, Daniel, was described as the most righteous man in his generation.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Number 5, we feast to become weak so that God can become strong.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   By fasting you make a conscious decision and a choice that we demonstrate.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   By an outward act that you want God's power to flow through you and not your own power.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   You want God's answer, not yours.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   That's why God said to Paul, "My power is made perfect in your weakness."
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   See what David says in the Psalms.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Psalm 109, "My knees give way from fasting, my body is thin and gaunt."
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Not a good advertisement for fasting.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   "I am the object of scorn from my accusers.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   When they see me they shake their heads.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Help me, oh Lord, my God.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Save me in accordance with Your love.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Let them know that it is Your hand that You, oh Lord, have done it."
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Number 6, we fast to attain God's support in order to accomplish His will.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   In the book of Acts, chapter 13, we read, "So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Then two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus."
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And in the next chapter, chapter 14, Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord in whom they had put their trust.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I find it fascinating that the leaders of Antioch fasted and prayed before they sent out Paul and Barnabas.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Why?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   So leaders would make the right choice and the success of the mission.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   In the next chapter, we read Paul and Barnabas following the same pattern.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   We should do the same before major decisions and get God on our side.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Number 7, we fast in times of crisis.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I don't need to tell you. This is Hong Kong. This is the world.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   In 2020, we are in a time of crisis.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Man has always turned to God in times of crisis.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Take the book of Esther, which we will study over the next few weeks.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I want to ask you a question. When was the most critical time in the whole history of the Jewish nation?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   You might say, "Pastor John, it was the Holocaust when 6 million Jews were executed."
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And I say to you, though Hitler massacred 6 million Jews, many Jews survived in different parts of the world.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   In Esther's time, Haman was on the verge of wiping out the entire Jewish race.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's a crisis. The death warrant was already signed and chopped.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   When Esther risked her life and entered the king's presence and requested mercy and pardon for the Jewish people.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   We read Esther 4. We'll read this again in a few weeks. Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   "Go gather all the Jews who are in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king. And even though it is against the law,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and if I perish, I perish." Number 8, we fast to seek God's direction.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   The book of Ezra, we don't read that very often, chapter 8. "There by the Ahava Canal, I proclaim a fast
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for thousands of our children with our possessions."
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And then we read in Ezra 8.23, "So we fasted and petitioned our God about this. And he answered our prayer."
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   We know there are a lot of people in our church seeking God's direction for their life, especially at the moment.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   When we need God's direction, when we're confused about which way we have to go, one of the best things we can do is to fast.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   This is especially true for personal relationships, i.e. a marriage partner or a possible career move.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And lastly, but not least, we fast to obtain understanding and divine revelation.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   We as a church need revelation. We need understanding of matters. We need to understand situations or biblical truths.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Jeremiah said in chapter 36, "So you go to the house of the Lord on the day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated. Read to them all the people of Judah who come in from their towns."
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Sometimes the understanding comes as we fast. Sometimes later on.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Fasting is both common in the Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, and in church history.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Jesus did it. Almost every great church leader over the centuries has done it.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   It has a close connection to church revival.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Now this is important. Fasting is not to earn brownie points.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Can I just say today, straight off, God will not love you anymore because you fast.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   You cannot earn brownie points with God.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   But it does make a connection to a supernatural God.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Put simply, it clears out the pipe that connects us to God's anointing.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   You are humbling yourself. You see your priorities more clearly. You see balance returned to your life.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You see selfish ambition and pride washed away.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   You will be more sensitive to God's Holy Spirit.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Your areas of weakness and susceptibility will rise to the surface so that God can deal with them.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   But I know the question you're asking. How? How do I fast?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   I sincerely believe that God wants to strip away the mystery and shed his light on this wonderful and simple tool for triumph in our lives and in our church.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Most problems concern the legalistic ideas of what a fast is and what a fast isn't.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   The good news? This is not a legalistic fast.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   No one is going to tell you what to do.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   No one is going to tell you how to fast. It is between you and God.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You ask the Holy Spirit to tell you.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   But we are going to try and help and encourage you.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   We are going to attempt to answer some FAQs.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Firstly, it's not a diet.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Although a by-product may be weight loss.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   What are the things to avoid?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Acidic juices.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Orange, grapefruit.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   If you have them, dilute them 1 to 5.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Apple juice is good, but what sugar?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Dilute it. Yuck!
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Other things.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   I suggest abstaining from meat and/or desserts.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Abstain from TV.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Computer.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   For me, Facebook.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Email.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Music.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And give the time to God.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Spend the time in the Word of God.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Get your face out of Facebook and get your face into the book.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   This leads to the next question.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   How do I spend the time?
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Pray.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Seek God.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Full stop.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Please respect your body during fasting.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Don't be cruel to your body.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   If you feel weaker, sit down and rest.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Regular water.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   You may need to amend your normal exercise.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It's not the time to do the mackerel trail.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   But you are the boss.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Tell your body, "I'm the boss!"
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   If your body says, "I'm hungry," you say, "Shut up!"
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   How do I start?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Start small.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   In moderation.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Just as you don't start jogging by running a marathon.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   We doubt whether a 21 or 40 day fast is the best way to begin fasting.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   It is just as scriptural to do a one day fast or even a partial fast.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Generally, everyone can go one day without food, water or any other liquid.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   We are planning a three day fast.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   A three day fast is a good way to kick off fasting.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   How do I break the fast?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Not with a huge juicy steak and extra fries.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Or four big mac meals.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   You will hurt yourself.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   You need wisdom.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   How do we come into the fast?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Not, "I'm going to have a big blowout tonight because I'm fasting tomorrow."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   How do we break the fast?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   We suggest small helpings of fresh fruit.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Some salad.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Some coleslaw.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Some yogurt or USA yogurt.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   What are the different types of fast?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   The first one is a complete fast.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Eat or drink nothing.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Not normally recommended.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   We are not recommending this.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   The body can normally only understand three days.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   This is a fast of desperation, all out hunger and urgency.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   If you ever feel called to fast in this way, come and tell us first.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Secondly, is what I call a normal fast.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Suggested for those who have fasted before.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Like Jesus, total abstention from food with a regular intake of water.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I suggest distilled water.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It flushes the poison out of your system.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   A squeeze of lemon juice often helps the taste.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Or herbal tea.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Avoid tea, coffee and other caffeinated drinks.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Number three, a partial, sometimes called a Daniel fast.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Recommended if you have never fasted before.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   At least at first.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   If you look at the book of Daniel, Daniel ate no meat.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   But did eat veggies and did drink water.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   God will honour this as much as he will a total fast.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Daniel 10 says, at this time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   I ate no choice food, no meat or wine touched my lips.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   This is a model for our three day fast.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   No meat, wine or fine foods.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   But read my lips.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Be led by the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And lastly, a corporate or a group fast.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   There is great power when a group or a nation fast together.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And that is why we are planning as a church and as a city to do so.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   A corporate fast turned God's wrath from Nineveh in the story of Jonah.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Ezra called one, Esther called one, Jehoshaphat called one.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Joel beseeched the people to call one.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And the Hong Kong church is calling one.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   I want to finish by talking about the great power of the corporate fast.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I've called it the great crescendo.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Matthew 18 says, "Again I tell you, if two of you on earth agree on anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven."
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   What we are is, I believe, a great orchestra.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   We saw that online this weekend as so many people came together.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Listen to a violin play. It's beautiful.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Listen to a trumpet play. It's stirring.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   When all the instruments play together, it's a symphony.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   When you fast and pray, you are like that violin. Beautiful.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   When we fast and pray together, we are like a great orchestra in harmony with great power.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   We believe that God is calling this church and this city to great things in 2020 and beyond.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Church, and this is important.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   We believe that as we come together in harmony, firstly with each other, and secondly with God's Holy Spirit, then things will change.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   See this as a blessing, not an inconvenience.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Ask the Holy Spirit to lead you in the type of fast you undertake.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Don't get too hung up on this.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   What is important is your heart.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Johnny and Michelle are going to come and lead us in prayer right now.
