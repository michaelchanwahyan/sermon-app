1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
 Now we're gonna pray, and we're gonna pray for the church,

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,860
 and especially our service, joint service next week.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,940
 Heavenly Father, we thank you

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,920
 that even though things in this world are vulnerable,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,380
 people are vulnerable, people are sick because of the virus,

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,820
 that Lord, you are still sovereign,

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,260
 you are still in control.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,080
 And we ask that Lord, you would empower

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,960
 those who are in charge to make the right decisions,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,280
 that you would empower those medical workers

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,900
 to make the right decisions to help people.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,140
 And I pray that Lord, those who are sick

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,940
 will be able to draw strength from you and turn to you.

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,700
 And Lord, we pray for the churches in Hong Kong,

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,420
 that Lord, that they would be pillars of light

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,180
 to be a city on a hill for this time.

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,180
 I pray for our joint service next week

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,860
 that as we gather together,

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,680
 that Lord, you would unite us as one to worship you,

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,940
 to pray for our city, to pray for each other,

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,580
 and to encourage each other.

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,220
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,700
 And now, let's pass the time to Pastor James.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,860
 - Hello KSCI, it's a joy to be able

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,500
 to bring you the word today

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,300
 as we finish off the series on Jesus as King.

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,340
 Through these last few weeks,

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,980
 we've been going through and exploring Jesus as Kingship

29
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,420
 through the book of Matthew.

30
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,940
 And today, we look at the final topic, the King's request.

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,380
 Last week, we had the resurrection

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,900
 at the beginning of Matthew 28,

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,580
 and today we finish this chapter

34
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,300
 and the whole book on the Great Commission.

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,460
 You see, it's through the resurrection

36
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,780
 that Jesus as Kingship has now been confirmed.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,740
 His Kingship has been established,

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,380
 and now a response is demanded.

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,120
 Jesus is commissioning out his disciples to go,

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,620
 to make disciples of all nations.

41
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,460
 And today, as we go through these verses here,

42
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,040
 I pray that God really stirs up in you

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,140
 a heart for mission,

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,940
 a heart for living out our calling

45
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,020
 in this world that is full of bad news,

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,920
 to really commit to spreading the good news.

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,020
 So the first verse that I wanna go through is this.

48
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,860
 Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth

49
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,200
 "has been given to me."

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,100
 See, because of the resurrection,

51
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,980
 the scope of Jesus' authority is now the universe.

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,340
 I'm reminded of Philippians 2,

53
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,780
 where the apostle Paul writes,

54
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,860
 "Now Jesus didn't count equality with God

55
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,560
 "a thing to be grasped,

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,020
 "but he submitted himself to God's will obediently,

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,400
 "even to the point of death on the cross.

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,320
 "And because of that, and because he was raised alive,

59
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,220
 "God now has bestowed upon him

60
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,520
 "the name that is above every name,

61
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,300
 "and that every knee should bow,

62
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,820
 "that every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord."

63
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,500
 That is so in line with what Jesus is talking about here

64
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,140
 in Matthew 28.

65
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,260
 And I'm reminded of the beginning of Jesus' ministry

66
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,300
 in Matthew 4, where after he's baptised

67
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,640
 and after the heavens open and God declares him his son,

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,140
 Jesus is led into the wilderness

69
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,480
 and the enemy tempts him and says,

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,180
 "Hey, bow before me,

71
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,380
 "and I will give you all the kingdoms of the world."

72
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,720
 Just, that's all you have to do, just bow before me.

73
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,680
 And Jesus resists that temptation.

74
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,560
 He knows that he had to go through the cross,

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,160
 but by going through the cross,

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,260
 he now has authority over heaven and earth,

77
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,440
 so much more than what the enemy promised.

78
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,580
 And so after that, the second, the next verse is this,

79
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,400
 "Because of that authority,

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,380
 "go therefore and make disciples of all nations."

81
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,680
 Because of that authority,

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,140
 a new era of ministry was being ushered in,

83
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,920
 that now the disciples would just take this good news,

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,600
 take this gospel to the ends of the earth,

85
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,640
 to all nations.

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
 And the word there in the Bible is taethne,

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
 to all races, to all cultures, to take it to them.

88
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,140
 I'm reminded of Acts 1a, where Jesus says,

89
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,220
 "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,

90
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,120
 "Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,340
 This was the moment that a new ministry was beginning.

92
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,360
 And so because of this authority, we go.

93
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,740
 Because of this authority, we go in confidence.

94
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,440
 The guy that we're talking about just defeated death,

95
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,920
 death itself.

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,940
 We have no more reason to fear.

97
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,720
 He is in control of heaven and earth.

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,500
 He is in complete control.

99
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,680
 We are in his hands and we have nothing to fear.

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,540
 So therefore, go.

101
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,200
 And this command to go is a command, it's not an option.

102
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,080
 It's not a recommendation, it's not a suggestion.

103
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,120
 Hey, if you feel like it, go.

104
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
 We see so often for us in this day and age,

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,080
 we make so many excuses, right?

106
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,720
 We think we're too busy, it's too hard to go to those people.

107
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,080
 They're too busy.

108
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,640
 And they're probably not receptive anyway.

109
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,560
 And actually, well, I'm probably not very good

110
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
 at explaining this message.

111
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,460
 And it really shouldn't be me.

112
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,300
 It should be someone else.

113
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,340
 It should be those people who are missionaries.

114
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,140
 Maybe they should go.

115
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,340
 But you see, God's command is for all of us to go

116
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,420
 and make disciples of all nations, to not give excuses.

117
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,860
 And especially during a time like this,

118
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,860
 where we have the coronavirus, the world needs the church.

119
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,100
 You know, I read an article recently which said,

120
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,760
 if the church isn't relevant to a world

121
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,840
 in the grip of coronavirus, it isn't relevant at all.

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,720
 You know, the church, the early church,

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 was birthed through crisis, changes in circumstance.

124
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,360
 The disciples, knowing that they needed

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,320
 to do something different, to change,

126
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,920
 their lives were transformed after the resurrection.

127
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,800
 We now have this unique opportunity.

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,560
 The church has this unique opportunity

129
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,040
 to be God's hands and feet.

130
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
 Are we willing to take that up?

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,100
 Or are we still making excuses for ourselves?

132
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,200
 Are we thinking, we're just too busy, they're too busy,

133
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,680
 it's just not right, I'm not equipped for it.

134
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,840
 Is there all of that going on?

135
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,320
 Or maybe we just wanna focus ourselves.

136
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,000
 My question is, where is the church during this time?

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
 It's the thing that I've been convicted with.

138
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,240
 What are we doing as Christ's body?

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,880
 Or are we simply being ostriches

140
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,640
 and just burying our heads in the ground,

141
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,880
 hoping for things to get back to normal soon

142
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,200
 so we can go about our daily routines?

143
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,800
 You know, I'm gonna be starting to work

144
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,680
 with a missions organization called Young Life.

145
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,640
 While still partnering and staying with Kongfolk,

146
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,460
 so don't worry, I'm still gonna be around.

147
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,320
 But Young Life's mission is to go

148
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,200
 to the people who are unreached,

149
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,300
 in particular, the next generation.

150
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,400
 We know, from this last year in Hong Kong,

151
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,000
 we've seen a generation of young people

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,160
 in this city hurting and in pain.

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,480
 And we recognize that we need to take the gospel to them.

154
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,720
 In fact, Young Life began 80 years ago in America

155
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
 in a church, in a church looking across the street

156
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,840
 and seeing a group of young people

157
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
 who they weren't reaching.

158
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,200
 And they decided, well, if they're not coming

159
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,720
 into the church, then we must go out.

160
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,680
 You know, a few months ago, when we were gathering

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,920
 at KFCI in Admiralty on a Saturday evening,

162
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,020
 which seems like such a long time ago now,

163
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,600
 but there was a lot of unrest on the streets.

164
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
 And I remember just standing in the windows

165
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,320
 of our beautiful church building,

166
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,400
 which is just right there, the Far East Finance Center.

167
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,000
 And I remember just asking, God,

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,080
 if we are called to reach these next generation people,

169
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
 if we are to reach these young people,

170
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,920
 if they're not coming in to hit this church,

171
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,560
 then how can we get out to them?

172
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,400
 And that is why I'm joining Young Life

173
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,880
 in order to hopefully partner with churches like Kongfog,

174
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,040
 like other organisations around the city,

175
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,760
 which are doing great work to reach the next generation,

176
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,280
 to go to them.

177
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,620
 This is totally in line with what Jesus' last request here

178
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,000
 for us is, the Great Commission,

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 that we must go to make disciples of all nations.

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
 So the question really is, where is the church?

181
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,920
 Is it genuinely a living organism?

182
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,440
 Or is it merely an institution bound by walls?

183
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,800
 And right now we're not even allowed in our walls,

184
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
 not together at least.

185
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,160
 So why not use this opportunity to rethink how we do church,

186
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,720
 to rethink how we live out our faith,

187
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
 and really reach out to these people?

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
 Why?

189
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,600
 Because Christ died and rose again.

190
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
 And we are sharing with those this good news,

191
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,840
 that there is power in His resurrection.

192
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,480
 That is the message that we need to be carrying

193
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,280
 to the world right now.

194
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,120
 And you might be sitting here and asking,

195
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,320
 "Fine, I know I should go.

196
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,660
 "I know I need to make disciples, but how?

197
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,360
 "What do I even need to do?"

198
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,520
 And Jesus carries on here and gives us two very simple steps

199
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,180
 on what we really should be doing

200
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,120
 when we're making disciples of all nations.

201
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
 And the first one is to baptise them,

202
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,240
 and the second one is to teach them.

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,660
 And we'll go through each of these now.

204
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,900
 The first one, baptising them in the name of the Father,

205
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,260
 Son, and Holy Spirit.

206
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,360
 That is the first step,

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,580
 is basically taking the gospel to these people,

208
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,800
 taking it to them and saying,

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,880
 "Look, this world may be full of bad news right now.

210
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,820
 "Your life may be full of bad news and brokenness,

211
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,100
 "but I want to share with you good news.

212
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,920
 "And I want to encourage you to repent.

213
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,300
 "Repent and turn from your old ways and follow God,

214
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,440
 "because if you follow God,

215
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,440
 "He will lead you to a life that is abundant and fulfilled."

216
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,340
 And from there, as they turn from their old ways

217
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,820
 and as they get baptised,

218
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,140
 as they identify with Christ's death

219
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,260
 and also His resurrection,

220
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,560
 they then identify with God's covenant with His people,

221
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,720
 and they are now in communion with His body, together.

222
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,020
 Before, they were individuals broken in sin,

223
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,820
 but as they become baptised, as they repent,

224
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,540
 they are now baptised into a community,

225
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,220
 a body that seeks to reflect Christ.

226
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,660
 And from there, you see Jesus saying,

227
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,300
 baptising them in the name of the Father,

228
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,580
 Son and the Holy Spirit.

229
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,060
 Jesus is identifying Himself with God.

230
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,180
 He's declaring that He is God,

231
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,540
 that He is now seated at the right hand of God.

232
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,600
 He really is King.

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,700
 So He baptised them in the name of the Father,

234
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,540
 Son and Holy Spirit.

235
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,740
 And then what do we do?

236
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,160
 We teach them to observe all that I have commanded you,

237
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,320
 all that Jesus has commanded.

238
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,300
 You see, I fear sometimes, modern day Christianity,

239
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,300
 we have taken a shortcut when it comes to evangelism.

240
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,740
 We take the gospel to them,

241
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,020
 we take people to the altar, and then we leave.

242
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,000
 And then we let them deal with their business,

243
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,740
 and our relationships are becoming more and more at risk

244
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,740
 of simply just being shallow and superficial.

245
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,980
 But what Jesus is saying here,

246
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,660
 to really make disciples, we need to invest in them

247
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,220
 and to live and engage in deep relationship

248
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,360
 with these people.

249
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,080
 In fact, Jesus Himself did this.

250
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,420
 His strategy to rescue the world, to save the world,

251
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,780
 was to focus on a group of three people,

252
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,100
 of 12 people, of 72, and a few hundreds,

253
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,560
 and let that multiply.

254
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,780
 And He focused on living with those 12 disciples

255
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,120
 for three whole years.

256
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,280
 Living with them, staying in the same place with them,

257
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,320
 traveling with them, walking long walks with them,

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,700
 doing life together with them.

259
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,700
 Not just doing an evangelistic conference or an event,

260
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,400
 but rather, the way we are gonna make disciples

261
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,680
 is to engage in deep relationship.

262
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,560
 Now I think back to myself,

263
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,560
 some of the most rewarding years of discipleship

264
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,400
 that Christina and I have experienced

265
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,340
 in these last few years is when we really got

266
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,980
 to do life together with some of our disciples.

267
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,840
 It wasn't just meeting them on Sundays

268
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,880
 and having refreshments after service

269
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,520
 or doing a jock jamming session here and there.

270
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,640
 It was actually having them live with us.

271
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,680
 It was actually having them eat with us,

272
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,920
 do the dishes with us, do our laundry with us.

273
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,440
 And that was when we grew the most.

274
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,080
 And that's when they were able to grow the most.

275
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,120
 Deep discipleship here is key.

276
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,360
 Getting involved in each other's lives,

277
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,660
 earning the right to be heard.

278
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,300
 Let us commit to doing that.

279
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,900
 Another thing about teaching people

280
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,700
 to observe what Jesus commanded is the prerequisite

281
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,020
 is that we ourselves are observing what Jesus commanded.

282
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,380
 We need to be following Christ ourselves.

283
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,940
 And going back to Young Life,

284
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,820
 one of the things that really drew my heart towards it

285
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,980
 was their mission statement is very simple.

286
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,780
 To introduce adolescents to Jesus Christ.

287
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,940
 To introduce adolescents to Jesus.

288
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,220
 And I was really reflecting on this

289
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,260
 as I was praying about this.

290
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,500
 And one thing that really came up for me was

291
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,660
 if I'm gonna be introducing the next generation to Jesus,

292
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,460
 I'd better get to know Jesus well myself.

293
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,940
 I'd best be observing the things that he's commanded of me.

294
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,220
 Because otherwise, who am I even introducing?

295
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,060
 When I was a science teacher back in England,

296
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,260
 I'd be teaching all different students science experiments.

297
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,500
 I remember teaching the year sevens,

298
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,860
 the starch iodine test, where you have a bit of iodine

299
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,020
 and you do a couple of drops onto a cracker

300
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,580
 and then you see that if starch is present, it turns black.

301
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,180
 And before every experiment,

302
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,580
 I would first have to do a demonstration

303
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,460
 to show them how to do it.

304
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,260
 It's only then can they copy and follow.

305
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,980
 That is exactly the same with discipleship.

306
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,420
 Another example is when I was coaching

307
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,740
 the school basketball team.

308
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,420
 If I wanted to teach these players a layup,

309
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,100
 I would first have to demonstrate a layup first.

310
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,300
 I would first have to show them how to do a layup,

311
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,140
 that I can do a layup myself,

312
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,900
 and then for them to observe and then to imitate and watch.

313
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,820
 As we make disciples, we have to be committed

314
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,020
 to observing Jesus' commandments ourselves.

315
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,140
 Once we do that, we are then able to engage in their lives

316
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,980
 and show them how to live lives that are following God.

317
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,980
 Jesus then finishes the book of Matthew.

318
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,140
 These final words here,

319
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,020
 with just this beautiful reminder encouragement,

320
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,620
 "Behold, I am with you always."

321
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,860
 I am with you always.

322
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,460
 That He is with us.

323
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,700
 He is the most perfect storyteller here

324
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,380
 and He takes us full circle.

325
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,980
 Back to Matthew 1:23, when it was said,

326
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,860
 "He shall be called Emmanuel, God with us."

327
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,300
 Jesus reminds us that as we go out on this mission,

328
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,700
 we will be accompanied by Him.

329
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,540
 But I don't know about you,

330
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,140
 but sometimes I feel that it's hard

331
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,820
 to really feel Jesus' presence, it's hard to see Him.

332
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,700
 And what I've seen from this passage here,

333
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,980
 in these few verses, is that we have some clues

334
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,780
 as to what may be able to help us see and feel Jesus more.

335
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,180
 And the first is this, it says,

336
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,180
 "Behold, I am with you always."

337
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,620
 The word you there in the original language

338
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,740
 refers to a plural sense, you all.

339
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,340
 So it's basically to say, I will be with you all.

340
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,100
 What this tells me is this,

341
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,220
 Jesus is most visible when we are in community,

342
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,460
 when we as His body are together.

343
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,140
 Now, I know it's a strange time right now,

344
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,580
 we're all socially and physically distanced,

345
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,260
 but we need to maximise whatever we have,

346
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,220
 technology, Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube Lives, WhatsApp.

347
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,940
 We need to use all these to the best of our ability

348
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,100
 to replicate, to imitate what community is,

349
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,380
 to do it to the best of our abilities.

350
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,740
 But then also recognising,

351
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,580
 and I definitely have felt this,

352
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,780
 even though we have all this technology,

353
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,140
 I've also become so grateful,

354
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,140
 and I yearn so much to be together again physically,

355
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,940
 to be in community together.

356
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,140
 And the Hebrew writer tells us to stop,

357
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,020
 to never neglect meeting each other,

358
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,300
 to never stop staring each other in love.

359
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,900
 And I pray that once these guidelines loosen,

360
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,060
 once the coronavirus subsides,

361
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,300
 that we will have a fresh level of motivation

362
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,260
 to get together again, to be together, to commune.

363
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,460
 It's because when we commune together,

364
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,260
 when we are together, Jesus is the most visible.

365
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,740
 That is when we see and feel Him the most.

366
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,820
 That is when we are reminded that we are not alone,

367
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,020
 because we have each other, and together we form His body.

368
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,300
 And the second is this, I will be with you always.

369
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,500
 And for me, this is in the context of the Great Commission,

370
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,660
 I'll be with you always when you are on mission.

371
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,260
 Sometimes I feel that I lack awareness of Jesus' presence,

372
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,860
 or I don't feel Him as much,

373
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,100
 and I wonder whether it's because it's during those times

374
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,340
 where I've almost lost sight of the vision.

375
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,820
 I've been so caught up with, sometimes work with,

376
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,620
 with the distractions of this world,

377
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,540
 that I've lost sight of the mission.

378
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,740
 You see, when we are on mission,

379
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,500
 that is when we feel the presence of Jesus the most.

380
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,020
 So if you, brother, sister, are feeling like

381
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,420
 you are distanced from Jesus,

382
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,620
 my two encouragements to you is this,

383
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,100
 get connected with your fellow brothers and sisters,

384
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,140
 whether it's over technology for now,

385
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,620
 or whether as soon as you're able to be

386
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,380
 with each other physically.

387
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,700
 After that, engage in mission.

388
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,940
 If we would commit to being His body,

389
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,260
 and being a moving body, a moving, living organism,

390
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,340
 I am sure that we will be able to feel

391
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,460
 the presence of Jesus in our lives.

392
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,780
 And He finishes with this,

393
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,180
 "Behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."

394
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,700
 Jesus is putting a final full stop on the story.

395
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,740
 He's saying He will be there at the very, very end,

396
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,420
 that He is the beginning and the end.

397
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,980
 He was the word of the beginning,

398
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,220
 and He will be the one that returns at the end.

399
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,900
 He is the Alpha and Omega.

400
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,220
 Jesus Himself will be the one that puts the final,

401
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,380
 full stop on this story here.

402
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,700
 That is an encouragement to me,

403
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,540
 and I hope it is an encouragement to you.

404
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,780
 It's saying that whatever's happening in your life,

405
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,980
 if it's going up and down, up and down,

406
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,460
 if there's protests and viruses and recessions

407
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,580
 and sicknesses and broken relationships,

408
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,740
 whatever it is, Jesus is the one

409
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,180
 who is gonna have the final say.

410
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,820
 He will be with us all to the end of the age.

411
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,100
 See, if we believe in the beginning of the story,

412
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,180
 and we believe in the end,

413
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,900
 my question is then, how are we living in the middle?

414
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,540
 Are our lives living according to what we believe?

415
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,180
 That Jesus was there at the beginning,

416
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,700
 and He also has already claimed the victory at the end,

417
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,940
 and we therefore have to live lives of courageous mission

418
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,100
 to share this good news,

419
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,540
 because the good news is coming at the very end.

420
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,180
 Then when you watch a movie and you invest in a character,

421
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,860
 one of your favourite characters,

422
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,900
 but of course a great movie involves trials

423
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,860
 and tribulations and ups and downs,

424
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,940
 but at the very end, the main character comes through.

425
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,060
 The victory is won somehow.

426
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,540
 You see, and when you watch that movie again

427
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,220
 for the second or third or the tenth time,

428
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,900
 you're not as worried as the first time anymore,

429
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,300
 because you know what's gonna happen.

430
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,980
 You know what's gonna end.

431
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,540
 That's the same here.

432
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,460
 If we know Jesus is gonna be at the end of the story,

433
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,740
 He will be with us to the end of the age,

434
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,780
 we should have no reason to fear.

435
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,460
 And what does that mean?

436
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,620
 It means that we therefore should go with courage,

437
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,180
 because He has authority in heaven and on earth.

438
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,140
 We then, our job, our duty,

439
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,180
 what we've been commissioned to do

440
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,660
 is to make disciples of all nations.

441
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,100
 Brother, sisters, it's been a joy to be able to

442
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,540
 share this word with you today.

443
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,340
 I hope it blesses you, and I really, really pray

444
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,620
 that we'll be able to see each other again soon.

445
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,460
 Bye.
