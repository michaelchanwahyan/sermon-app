1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
 We get to worship together.

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,140
 We get to hear God's word together.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,660
 And we get equipped to go into the world.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,080
 So please join with us in the way that you feel comfortable as we worship God with all

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,080
 our heart, soul, mind and strength.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run,

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,080
 the fountain I drink from, oh He is my song.

8
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:06,080
 Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide,

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,080
 the ransom for my life, oh He is my song.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,080
 You are good, good, oh.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,080
 You are good, good, oh.

12
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 You are good, good, oh.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,080
 You are good, good, oh.

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 Let the King of my heart be the wind inside myself,

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56,080
 the anchor in the waves, oh He is my song.

16
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:03,080
 Let the King of my heart be the fire inside my veins,

17
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,080
 the echo of my days, oh He is my song.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,080
 You are good, good, oh.

19
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 You are good, good, oh.

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,080
 You are good, good, oh.

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:39,080
 You are good, good, oh.

22
00:02:39,080 --> 00:03:08,080
 You're never gonna let, you're never gonna let me down.

23
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:35,080
 You're never gonna let, you're never gonna let me down.

24
00:03:35,080 --> 00:04:01,380
 You are good, good, good You are good, good, good

25
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:11,880
 You're never gonna let me down You're never gonna let, you're never gonna let me down

26
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,880
 You're never gonna let, you're never gonna let me down

27
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,880
 You're never gonna let, you're never gonna let me down

28
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,380
 You're never gonna let, you're never gonna let me down

29
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:46,380
 You are good, good, oh You are good, good, oh

30
00:04:46,380 --> 00:05:02,380
 You are good, good, oh You are good, good, oh

31
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:17,380
 (Instrumental)

32
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:33,380
 Jesus, what a Savior What a brother, what a friend

33
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:47,380
 Lifter of the lonely God, You meet me where I am

34
00:05:47,380 --> 00:06:02,380
 Jesus, what a Savior What a brother, what a friend

35
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:17,380
 Lifter of the lonely God, You meet me where I am

36
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:31,380
 Your heart, it knows No borders, no walls

37
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:45,380
 You're constantly moving towards me With open arms

38
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:59,380
 I've never known a love like yours I've never known a love like yours

39
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:13,380
 I've never known a love like yours Never known a love like yours

40
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
 Sing Jesus

41
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:29,380
 Jesus, what a Savior What a brother, what a friend

42
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:42,380
 Lifter of the lonely God, You meet me where I am

43
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:57,380
 Your heart, it knows No borders, no walls

44
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:09,380
 You're constantly moving towards me With open arms

45
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:37,380
 I've never known a love like yours I've never known a love like yours

46
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
 Hallelujah

47
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:53,380
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah What a beautiful way You've shown us

48
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:06,380
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah What a wonderful Savior

49
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:21,380
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah What a beautiful way You've shown us

50
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:34,380
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah What a wonderful Savior

51
00:09:34,380 --> 00:10:03,380
 I've never known a love like yours I've never known a love like yours

52
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:17,380
 Jesus, what a Savior What a brother, what a friend

53
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:34,380
 Lifter of the lonely God, You meet me where I am

54
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:41,380
 You're constantly moving towards me With open arms

55
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,380
 I've never known a love like yours I've never known a love like yours

56
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:55,380
 Next week is the first week of May. And yes, we'll still be online, but with a difference.

57
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,380
 I know how much we've enjoyed worshipping together online.

58
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:08,380
 And next week, we will join with all the international churches in Hong Kong for one combined service.

59
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,380
 And you'll be able to watch it at our normal time of 5.30 on a Saturday afternoon.

60
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,380
 Join us for One Church Hong Kong.

61
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:28,380
 Hi KFCI. So some of us have been preparing some care packages to hand out to the poor, the needy.

62
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:37,380
 And we've contacted the Christian Concern for the Homeless Association to just partner up with them and see what kind of supplies we can,

63
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,380
 or what kind of care and help we can provide for them, especially in this time of the epidemic.

64
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:51,380
 So if you'd be interested, we have outreach opportunities with them on the 12th of May, which is a Tuesday night from 7 to 9.15 p.m.

65
00:11:51,380 --> 00:12:01,380
 at Sham Shui Po or Cheung San Lan. If you're interested, just let me know. Email KFCI@conflict.org so I can just get you guys in touch.

66
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,380
 Hey guys, last time we talked to you about an exciting opportunity that we're going to be starting.

67
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:15,380
 Alpha. And once again, Alpha is a course that we're going to be doing online through Zoom, where your friends can know more about Jesus.

68
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:22,380
 We can discuss some of the life tough questions and have some good spiritual discussions together.

69
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:29,380
 I hope you'll scan the QR code and join us and invite some of the friends that might be interested.

70
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,380
 Now we're going to pray and pray for the church and especially our service, joint service next week.

71
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:47,380
 Heavenly Father, we thank you that even though things in this world are vulnerable, people are vulnerable, people are sick because of the virus,

72
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,380
 that Lord, you are still sovereign. You are still in control.

73
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,380
 And we ask that Lord, you would empower those who are in charge to make the right decisions,

74
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,380
 that you would empower those medical workers to make the right decisions to help people.

75
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,380
 And I pray that Lord, those who are sick will be able to draw strength from you and turn to you.

76
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:16,380
 And Lord, we pray for the churches in Hong Kong, that Lord, that they would be pillars of light to be a city on a hill for this time.

77
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:24,380
 I pray for our joint service next week, that as we gather together, that Lord, you would unite us as one to worship you,

78
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,380
 to pray for our city, to pray for each other and to encourage each other.

79
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,380
 In Christ's name we pray, Amen.

80
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,380
 And now, let's pass the time to Pastor James.

81
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:42,380
 Hello KSCI, it's a joy to be able to bring you the word today as we finish off the series on Jesus as King.

82
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,380
 Through these last few weeks, we've been going through and exploring Jesus' kingship through the book of Matthew.

83
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,380
 And today, we look at the final topic, the King's request.

84
00:13:53,380 --> 00:14:00,380
 Last week we had the resurrection at the beginning of Matthew 28, and today we finish this chapter and the whole book on the Great Commission.

85
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,380
 You see, it's through the resurrection that Jesus' kingship has now been confirmed.

86
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,380
 His kingship has been established and now a response is demanded.

87
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:15,380
 Jesus is commissioning out his disciples to go, to make disciples of all nations.

88
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:29,380
 And today, as we go through these verses here, I pray that God really stirs up in you a heart for mission, a heart for living out our calling in this world that is full of bad news, to really commit to spreading the good news.

89
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
 So the first verse that I want to go through is this.

90
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,380
 Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."

91
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,380
 See, because of the resurrection, the scope of Jesus' authority is now the universe.

92
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:55,380
 I'm reminded of Philippians 2 where the Apostle Paul writes, "Jesus didn't count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he submitted himself to God's will obediently, even to the point of death on a cross.

93
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:07,380
 And because of that, and because he was raised alive, God now has bestowed upon him the name that is above every name, and that every knee should bow, that every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord."

94
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:13,380
 That is so in line with what Jesus is talking about here in Matthew 28.

95
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,380
 And I'm reminded of the beginning of Jesus' ministry.

96
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:30,380
 In Matthew 4, where after he's baptised and after the heavens open and God declares him his son, Jesus is led into the wilderness and the enemy tempts him and says, "Hey, bow before me and I will give you all the kingdoms of the world."

97
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,380
 Just, that's all you have to do, just bow before me.

98
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,380
 And Jesus resists that temptation.

99
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:43,380
 He knows that he had to go through the cross, but by going through the cross he now has authority over heaven and earth.

100
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,380
 So much more than what the enemy promised.

101
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:56,380
 And so after that, the next verse is this, "Because of that authority, go therefore and make disciples of all nations."

102
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,380
 Because of that authority, a new era of ministry was being ushered in.

103
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:09,380
 That now the disciples would take this good news, take this gospel to the ends of the earth, to all nations.

104
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,380
 And the word there in the Bible is "taethne", to all races, to all cultures.

105
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,380
 To take it to them.

106
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:23,380
 I'm reminded of Acts 1a where Jesus says, "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."

107
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,380
 This was the moment that a new ministry was beginning.

108
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,380
 And so because of this authority we go.

109
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,380
 Because of this authority we go in confidence.

110
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,380
 The guy that we're talking about just defeated death.

111
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
 Death itself.

112
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
 We have no more reason to fear.

113
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,380
 He is in control of heaven and earth.

114
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
 He is in complete control.

115
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,380
 We are in his hands and we have nothing to fear.

116
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,380
 So therefore, go.

117
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,380
 And this command to go is a command.

118
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
 It's not an option.

119
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,380
 It's not a recommendation.

120
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
 It's not a suggestion.

121
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
 Hey, if you feel like it, go.

122
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,380
 You see, so often for us in this day and age we make so many excuses, right?

123
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
 We think we're too busy.

124
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,380
 It's too hard to go to those people.

125
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
 They're too busy.

126
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
 And they're probably not receptive anyway.

127
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,380
 And actually, well, I'm probably not very good at explaining this message.

128
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
 And it really shouldn't be me.

129
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
 It should be someone else.

130
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
 It should be those people who are missionaries.

131
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
 Maybe they should go.

132
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,380
 But you see, God's command is for all of us to go and make disciples of all nations,

133
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
 to not give excuses.

134
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,380
 And especially during a time like this, where we have the coronavirus,

135
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,380
 the world needs the church.

136
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,380
 You know, I read an article recently which said,

137
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,380
 "If the church isn't relevant to a world in the grip of coronavirus,

138
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
 it isn't relevant at all."

139
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,380
 You know, the church, the early church was birthed through crisis,

140
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,380
 changes in circumstance.

141
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,380
 The adopted disciples, knowing that they needed to do something different,

142
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,380
 to change their lives, were transformed after the resurrection.

143
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 We now have this unique opportunity.

144
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,380
 The church has this unique opportunity to be God's hands and feet.

145
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,380
 Are we willing to take that up, or are we still making excuses for ourselves?

146
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,380
 Are we thinking, "We're just too busy. They're too busy.

147
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
 It's just not right. I'm not equipped for it."

148
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
 Is there all of that going on?

149
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,380
 Or maybe we just want to focus ourselves.

150
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,380
 My question is, where is the church during this time?

151
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
 It's the thing that I've been convicted with.

152
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,380
 What are we doing as Christ's body?

153
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,380
 Or are we simply being ostriches and just burying our heads in the ground,

154
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,380
 hoping for things to get back to normal soon so we can go about our daily routines?

155
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,380
 I'm going to be starting to work with a missions organization called Young Life.

156
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,380
 While still partnering and staying with Kongfolks, don't worry, I'm still going to be around.

157
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,380
 But Young Life's mission is to go to the people who are unreached,

158
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
 in particular, the next generation.

159
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
 We know from this last year in Hong Kong,

160
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,380
 we've seen a generation of young people in this city hurting and in pain.

161
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,380
 We recognize that we need to take the gospel to them.

162
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,380
 In fact, Young Life began 80 years ago in America in a church.

163
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,380
 In a church looking across the street and seeing a group of young people who they weren't reaching.

164
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,380
 And they decided, "Well, if they're not coming into the church, then we must go out."

165
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,380
 You know, a few months ago when we were gathering at KFCI in Admiralty on a Saturday evening,

166
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,380
 which seems like such a long time ago now,

167
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,380
 but there was a lot of unrest on the streets.

168
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,380
 And I remember just standing in the windows of our beautiful church building,

169
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,380
 which is just right there, the Far East Finance Center.

170
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:55,380
 And I remember just asking, "God, if we are called to reach these next generation people,

171
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,380
 if we are to reach these young people,

172
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,380
 if they're not coming in to hit this church, then how can we get out to them?"

173
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,380
 And that is why I'm joining Young Life,

174
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,380
 in order to hopefully partner with churches like Kongfolk,

175
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,380
 and other organizations around the city which are doing great work to reach the next generation,

176
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,380
 to go to them.

177
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,380
 This is totally in line with what Jesus' last request here for us is,

178
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,380
 the Great Commission, that we must go to make disciples of all nations.

179
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,380
 So the question really is, where is the church?

180
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,380
 Is it genuinely a living organism?

181
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,380
 Or is it merely an institution bound by walls?

182
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,380
 And right now we're not even allowed in our walls, not together at least.

183
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,380
 So why not use this opportunity to rethink how we do church,

184
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,380
 to rethink how we live out our faith,

185
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
 and really reach out to these people.

186
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,380
 Why? Because Christ died and rose again.

187
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,380
 And we are sharing with those this good news,

188
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,380
 that there is power in His resurrection.

189
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,380
 That is the message that we need to be carrying to the world right now.

190
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,380
 And you might be sitting here and asking,

191
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,380
 "Fine, I know I should go, I know I need to make disciples, but how?

192
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
 What do I even need to do?"

193
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,380
 And Jesus carries on here and gives us two very simple steps

194
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,380
 on what we really should be doing when we're making disciples of all nations.

195
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,380
 And the first one is to baptize them, and the second one is to teach them.

196
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
 And we'll go through each of these now.

197
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:31,380
 The first one, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

198
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,380
 That is the first step, is basically taking the Gospel to these people,

199
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,380
 taking it to them and saying, "Look, this world may be full of bad news right now,

200
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,380
 your life may be full of bad news and brokenness,

201
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
 but I want to share with you good news.

202
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,380
 And I want to encourage you to repent.

203
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,380
 Repent and turn from your old ways and follow God.

204
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:57,380
 Because if you follow God, He will lead you to a life that is abundant and fulfilled."

205
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,380
 And from there, as they turn from their old ways and as they get baptized,

206
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,380
 as they identify with Christ's death and also His resurrection,

207
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,380
 they then identify with God's covenant with His people,

208
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,380
 and they are now in communion with His body, together.

209
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,380
 Before, they were individuals, broken in sin, but as they become baptized, as they repent,

210
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:27,380
 they are now baptized into a community, a body that seeks to reflect Christ.

211
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,380
 And from there, you see Jesus saying, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

212
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,380
 Jesus is identifying Himself with God.

213
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,380
 He's declaring that He is God, that He is now seated at the right hand of God.

214
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,380
 He really is King.

215
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,380
 So we baptize them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

216
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,380
 And then what do we do? We teach them to observe all that I have commanded you,

217
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,380
 all that Jesus has commanded.

218
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,380
 You see, I fear sometimes, modern day Christianity,

219
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,380
 we have taken a shortcut when it comes to evangelism.

220
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,380
 We take the gospel to them, we take people to the altar, and then we leave.

221
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
 And then we let them deal with their business.

222
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:17,380
 And our relationships are becoming more and more at risk of simply just being shallow and superficial.

223
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,380
 But what Jesus is saying here, to really make disciples, we need to invest in them

224
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,380
 and to live and engage in deep relationship with these people.

225
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,380
 In fact, Jesus Himself did this.

226
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,380
 His strategy to rescue the world, to save the world,

227
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,380
 was to focus on a group of three people, of twelve people, of seventy-two, and a few hundreds,

228
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
 and let that multiply.

229
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,380
 And He focused on living with those twelve disciples for three whole years.

230
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:54,380
 Living with them, staying in the same place with them, travelling with them, walking long walks with them,

231
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,380
 doing life together with them.

232
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:02,380
 Not just doing an evangelistic conference or an event,

233
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:08,380
 but rather the way we are going to make disciples is to engage in deep relationship.

234
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,380
 Now I think back to myself, some of the most rewarding years of discipleship that Christina and I

235
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:22,380
 have experienced in these last few years is when we really got to do life together with some of our disciples.

236
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,380
 It wasn't just meeting them on Sundays and having refreshments after service,

237
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,380
 or doing a jock jamming session here and there.

238
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,380
 It was actually having them live with us.

239
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,380
 It was actually having them eat with us, do the dishes with us, do our laundry with us.

240
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,380
 And that was when we grew the most.

241
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,380
 And that's when they were able to grow the most.

242
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,380
 Deep discipleship here is key.

243
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,380
 Getting involved in each other's lives, earning the right to be heard.

244
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,380
 Let us commit to doing that.

245
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,380
 Another thing about teaching people to observe what Jesus commanded is the prerequisite is that

246
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,380
 we ourselves are observing what Jesus commanded.

247
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,380
 We need to be following Christ ourselves.

248
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,380
 And going back to Young Life, one of the things that really drew my heart towards it was

249
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,380
 their mission statement is very simple.

250
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,380
 To introduce adolescents to Jesus Christ.

251
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,380
 To introduce adolescents to Jesus.

252
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,380
 And I was really reflecting on this as I was praying about this.

253
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,380
 One thing that really came up for me was, if I'm going to be introducing the next generation to Jesus,

254
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,380
 I'd better get to know Jesus well myself.

255
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,380
 I'd best be observing the things that he's commanded of me.

256
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,380
 Because otherwise, who am I even introducing?

257
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:45,380
 When I was a science teacher back in England, I'd be teaching all different students science experiments.

258
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,380
 I remember teaching the Year 7s the starch iodine test, where you have a bit of iodine and you do a couple of drops

259
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,380
 onto a cracker and then you see that if starch is present it turns black.

260
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,380
 Before every experiment, I would first have to do a demonstration.

261
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
 To show them how to do it.

262
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,380
 It's only them can they copy and follow.

263
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
 That is exactly the same with discipleship.

264
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,380
 Another example is when I was coaching the school basketball team.

265
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:17,380
 If I wanted to teach these players a lay-up, I would first have to demonstrate a lay-up first.

266
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,380
 I would first have to show them how to do a lay-up, that I can do a lay-up myself.

267
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,380
 And then for them to observe and then to imitate and watch.

268
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:32,380
 As we make disciples, we have to be committed to observing Jesus' commandments ourselves.

269
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:41,380
 Once we do that, we are then able to engage in their lives and show them how to live lives that are following God.

270
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,380
 Jesus then finishes the book of Matthew.

271
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,380
 These final words here, with just this beautiful reminder encouragement.

272
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,380
 "Behold, I am with you always."

273
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,380
 "I am with you always."

274
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 "He is with us."

275
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,380
 He is the most perfect storyteller here.

276
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:07,380
 He takes us full circle back to Matthew 1.23 when it was said, "He shall be called Emmanuel."

277
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
 "God with us."

278
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,380
 Jesus reminds us that as we go out on this mission, we will be accompanied by Him.

279
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,380
 I don't know about you, but sometimes I feel that it's hard to really feel Jesus' presence.

280
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,380
 It's hard to see Him.

281
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:30,380
 What I've seen from this passage here, these few verses, is that we have some clues as to what may be able to help us see and feel Jesus more.

282
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,380
 And the first is this. It says, "Behold, I am with you always."

283
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,380
 The word "you" there in the original language refers to a plural sense, "you all".

284
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,380
 So it's basically to say, "I will be with you all."

285
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
 What this tells me is this.

286
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,380
 Jesus is most visible when we are in community.

287
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,380
 When we as His body are together.

288
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,380
 Now, I know it's a strange time right now. We're all socially and physically distanced.

289
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,380
 But we need to maximise whatever we have.

290
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,380
 Technology, Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube Lives, WhatsApp.

291
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,380
 We need to use all these to the best of our ability to replicate, to imitate what community is.

292
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,380
 To do it to the best of our abilities.

293
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,380
 But then also recognising, and I definitely have felt this, even though we have all this technology,

294
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:23,380
 I've also become so grateful and I yearn so much to be together again physically.

295
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,380
 To be in community together.

296
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,380
 And the Hebrew writer tells us to stop, to never neglect meeting each other.

297
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,380
 To never stop staring each other in love.

298
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,380
 And I pray that once these guidelines loosen, once the coronavirus subsides,

299
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,380
 that we will have a fresh level of motivation to get together again.

300
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,380
 To be together, to commune. It's because when we commune together, when we are together,

301
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,380
 Jesus is the most visible. That is when we see and feel Him the most.

302
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
 That is when we are reminded that we are not alone.

303
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,380
 Because we have each other and together we form His body.

304
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,380
 And the second is this. I will be with you always.

305
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,380
 And for me, this is in the context of the Great Commission,

306
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,380
 I will be with you always when you are on mission.

307
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,380
 Sometimes I feel that I lack awareness of Jesus' presence or I don't feel Him as much.

308
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,380
 And I wonder whether it's because it's during those times where I've almost lost sight of the vision.

309
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,380
 I've been so caught up with sometimes work, with the distractions of this world,

310
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
 that I've lost sight of the mission.

311
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:36,380
 You see, when we are on mission, that is when we feel the presence of Jesus the most.

312
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,380
 So if you, brother, sister, are feeling like you are distanced from Jesus,

313
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
 my two encouragements to you is this.

314
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,380
 Get connected with your fellow brothers and sisters.

315
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:54,380
 Whether it's over technology for now, or whether as soon as you are able to be with each other physically.

316
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
 After that, engage in mission.

317
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,380
 If we would commit to being His body and being a moving body, a moving living organism,

318
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,380
 I am sure that we will be able to feel the presence of Jesus in our lives.

319
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
 And he finishes with this.

320
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,380
 "Behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."

321
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,380
 Jesus is putting a final full stop on the story.

322
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,380
 He's saying He will be there at the very, very end.

323
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
 That He is the beginning and the end.

324
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,380
 He was the word of the beginning and He will be the one that returns at the end.

325
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,380
 He is the Alpha and Omega.

326
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,380
 Jesus Himself will be the one that puts the final full stop on this story here.

327
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,380
 That is an encouragement to me and I hope it is an encouragement to you.

328
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,380
 It's saying that whatever is happening in your life, if it's going up and down, up and down,

329
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:48,380
 if there's protests and viruses and recessions and sicknesses and broken relationships, whatever it is,

330
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,380
 Jesus is the one who is going to have the final say.

331
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,380
 He will be with us all to the end of the age.

332
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,380
 See, if we believe in the beginning of the story and we believe in the end,

333
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,380
 my question is then, how are we living in the middle?

334
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,380
 Are our lives living according to what we believe?

335
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:16,380
 That Jesus was there at the beginning and He also has already claimed the victory at the end.

336
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:25,380
 And we therefore have to live lives of courageous mission to share this good news

337
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,380
 because the good news is coming at the very end.

338
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,380
 Then when you watch a movie and you invest in a character, one of your favourite characters,

339
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,380
 but of course a great movie involves trials and tribulations and ups and downs,

340
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,380
 but at the very end the main character comes through, the victory is won somehow.

341
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,380
 You see, when you watch that movie again for the second or the third or the tenth time,

342
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,380
 you're not as worried as the first time anymore because you know what's going to happen,

343
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
 you know what's going to end.

344
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
 That's the same here.

345
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:57,380
 If we know Jesus is going to be at the end of the story, He will be with us to the end of the age,

346
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
 we should have no reason to fear.

347
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,380
 And what does that mean?

348
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:10,380
 It means that we therefore should go with courage because He has authority in heaven and on earth.

349
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:18,380
 We then, our job, our duty, what we've been commissioned to do is to make disciples of all nations.

350
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,380
 Brother, sisters, it's been a joy to be able to share this Word with you today.

351
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,380
 I hope it blesses you and I really, really pray that we'll be able to see each other again soon.

352
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
 Bye.

353
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,380
 Thanks James for that amazing sermon.

354
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:39,380
 And now let us conclude in prayer that God would use us to fulfil His great commission around the world.

355
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:45,380
 Heavenly Father, we thank You for this time tonight, that we can listen to Your Word.

356
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:52,380
 We thank You for the great commission that Jesus gave us to go and make disciples of all nations.

357
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,380
 Lord, fill us with the Holy Spirit that we can go out in Your strength and with Your Spirit

358
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:05,380
 to go and share Your message wherever You call us, to our workplaces, to our friends, to our family,

359
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,380
 wherever You call us, whoever You surround us with.

360
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,380
 Lord, bless us as we go that we could be a blessing to others.

361
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,380
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

362
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,380
 God bless you. Stay safe.

363
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
 Amen.

364
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:28,380
 [END]
