1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,000
 He gives a great sermon on Ephesus

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,080
 and they were doing church the right way,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,040
 but they didn't have the right heart.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,680
 They didn't love with the first love of Jesus.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,200
 And today we're talking about Smyrna.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,520
 Has anybody been to Smyrna before?

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,520
 It is near Ephesus, actually.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,040
 It is only 80 kilometers north of Ephesus.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,240
 It was known for its architecture.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,100
 It was known as a rich city.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,360
 It was known as a seaport.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,360
 As you see here, it's very close to Athens and Rome.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,080
 It was known as a seaport.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,960
 It was also known, according to some of the research

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,960
 that I went into, it was known for myrrh.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,840
 So you hear Smyrna, myrrh.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,200
 And do you guys know what myrrh is?

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,920
 Anybody dressed in myrrh today?

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,960
 No? Okay.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,840
 Myrrh was used as perfume

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,560
 and also more commonly used as embodiment, right?

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,080
 And so in Egypt, they have mummies

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,760
 and they used myrrh a lot.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,760
 Possibly myrrh that was used for Jesus came from Smyrna.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,400
 We don't know exactly,

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,040
 but possibly that was one of the trades,

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,800
 major trades that they had.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,640
 And Smyrna, we will begin this letter in verse eight.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,760
 So the angel of the church in Smyrna write,

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,120
 "These are the words of him who is the first and the last,

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,540
 "who died and came to life again.

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,320
 "I know your afflictions and your poverty,

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,800
 "yet you are rich.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,680
 "I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,620
 "and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,360
 "Be not afraid of what you are about to suffer.

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,320
 "I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,220
 "to test you and you will suffer persecution for 10 days.

40
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,080
 "Be faithful, even to the point of death.

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,080
 "And I will give you life as your victor's crown.

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,060
 "Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,800
 "to the churches.

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,220
 "The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,320
 "by the second death."

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,860
 So we see here that in the first chapter of Revelations,

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,080
 Jesus introduces himself as the Alpha and the Omega.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,160
 And once again, he introduces himself here

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,160
 as the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,120
 The city of Smyrna was actually overtaken by a Lydian king.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,460
 And it was torn to pieces and it was only a village.

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,880
 But then Alexander the Great saw the city

53
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,840
 and he had a vision that this city would become great again.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,760
 And so Jesus might be playing on this death of the city

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,160
 and resurrection of the city.

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,840
 And that's why he might be introducing himself

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,200
 once again and emphasizing that he is the Alpha

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,000
 and the Omega, the first and the last.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And Jesus says that he knows, he knows.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,400
 Pastor James says last week, he reminded us,

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,240
 Jesus knew what was happening in the church of Ephesus.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,200
 And he also knows what is happening in Smyrna here.

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,500
 And he says, "I see three challenges.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,400
 I see your afflictions.

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,600
 I see three challenges that you are going through

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,720
 and that you are about to go through."

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,760
 And these are the three challenges, the three Ps,

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,760
 poverty, persecution, and prison or imprisonment.

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,440
 And the first thing he says in verse nine is,

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,760
 "I know your afflictions and your poverty.

71
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
 I know your poverty."

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,440
 Why were they poor?

73
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,880
 Why were they poor?

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,280
 What was the religious dominance of that time in that city?

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,900
 That city, just like Ephesus,

76
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,800
 was filled with all sorts of gods, right?

77
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,100
 Gods to Athena and Apollos

78
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,160
 and all those other Greek sort of gods.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,540
 It was full of those temples in that city.

80
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,140
 And so if you followed Jesus Christ

81
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,680
 and you were a Christian,

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,380
 possibly you couldn't get a job in that city.

83
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,880
 You couldn't get a job.

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,020
 And if you were in charge of trade,

85
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,940
 you were trying to trade something,

86
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,780
 and they were like,

87
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,780
 "Oh, has your product been blessed by Apollos or Athena

88
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,380
 or one of these gods?"

89
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,940
 And, "No, no, these products have been blessed by God."

90
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,780
 They would be like, "Why would I trade with you?

91
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,940
 Why would I trade with you?"

92
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,020
 And so these Christians were facing poverty.

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,740
 They were poor because they were Christian,

94
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,320
 because of their belief in Jesus Christ.

95
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
 They possibly could not get a job because of their faith.

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,040
 And also their trade was being affected.

97
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,440
 You know, I went to India several years ago.

98
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,180
 I've been to India a couple of times.

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,380
 And as I went to India

100
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,380
 and got in touch with some of the Christians

101
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,220
 that were there,

102
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,380
 did you know that in India,

103
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,940
 you have to place,

104
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,980
 like some other countries around the world,

105
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,380
 you have to place your religious status on your passport.

106
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,340
 You have to claim whether you're Hindu or a Christian

107
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,880
 or Catholic or...

108
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,520
 And because some of these people came in India,

109
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,120
 came to know Jesus,

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,180
 they decided to change their passport

111
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,680
 from Hindu to Christian.

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,680
 And some of them came from Hindu families.

113
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,520
 How do you think their families would take that?

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,020
 That they would change on their official status,

115
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,920
 that they've changed their religion?

116
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,160
 And some of them could not get a job

117
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,060
 because they were no longer Hindus.

118
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,760
 They were following Christ.

119
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,100
 I had dinner recently with a church member of mine

120
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,060
 from Toronto,

121
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,660
 who now works in Hong Kong.

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,020
 And she manages several portfolios for the company.

123
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,960
 And she would go out and meet other companies.

124
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,620
 And she's in charge of different trade deals

125
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,300
 or manufacturing deals.

126
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,200
 And a lot of them would go under the table and be like,

127
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,200
 "Hey, if you set up this deal between my company and yours,

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,540
 I'll give you something under the table, tax-free,

129
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,440
 so you can be rich."

130
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,340
 So that, it's a win-win, right?

131
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,500
 Your company wins, I win,

132
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,700
 and most importantly, you win as well.

133
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,280
 And she said a lot of people in her position

134
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,440
 already would be super rich, super rich.

135
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,940
 But she has made an oath

136
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,340
 because of her belief in Jesus Christ,

137
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,340
 she would not take some of these bribes.

138
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,000
 She's willing to stand for her faith.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,240
 She might've lost monetarily on some of these things,

140
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,340
 but yet she has chosen to obey Christ.

141
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,740
 And Jesus says to this church,

142
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,640
 and also to her, I believe,

143
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,500
 that you are rich, maybe not in terms of monetary,

144
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,740
 but you are rich in faith.

145
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,200
 You're rich in obeying God.

146
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,380
 You're rich in spiritual gifts and spiritual treasures.

147
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,580
 'Cause where your heart is, your treasure is also.

148
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,280
 And Jesus is saying here

149
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,820
 that you might not have gotten that job,

150
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,680
 might not have gotten that trade deal,

151
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,580
 but you are rich because your treasure is in heaven.

152
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,140
 Your treasure comes from the Lord.

153
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,720
 And so this was the first affliction,

154
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,540
 first tribulation that this church went through,

155
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,780
 that they were poor monetarily,

156
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,740
 but yet a rich church, a rich church.

157
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,420
 The second thing that they went through is persecution.

158
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,940
 And we see that in verse nine.

159
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,420
 I know about the slander of those who say

160
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,740
 they are Jews and are not,

161
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,220
 but are a synagogue of heaven.

162
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,180
 Oh, sorry, synagogue of Satan.

163
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,140
 The Jews back then had special entitlement

164
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,540
 to not have to worship the Roman gods.

165
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,840
 The Jews had the God of Israel, right?

166
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,340
 They had special privilege to not have to worship

167
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,620
 the Roman gods and they could just worship their own God,

168
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,820
 the God of Israel.

169
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
 And they had that privilege.

170
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,820
 However, the Christians threatened this entitlement.

171
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,420
 This entitlement because of several things.

172
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,420
 The first was an accusation of cannibalism.

173
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,060
 Okay, so they had communion, right?

174
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,900
 And so apparently they were eating the body of Christ

175
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,380
 and drinking the blood of Christ.

176
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,380
 And Jews were like these Christians, they're cannibalists.

177
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,060
 They're practicing cannibalism.

178
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,220
 How could they, right?

179
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,100
 And so they would complain maybe to the Roman authorities

180
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,100
 and they would exercise those who were Christians

181
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,200
 because of what they were doing.

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,400
 The second thing is these Christians would call each other,

183
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,060
 what do you guys call each other?

184
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,780
 Brothers and sisters in Christ.

185
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,520
 And the Romans had a very specific family system.

186
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,620
 They had a very specific citizen and slave system.

187
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,220
 And so for them to call each other just brothers and sisters

188
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,780
 and accept everyone into this family,

189
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,060
 it was as if they were going against

190
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,740
 the Roman family system.

191
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,340
 And so these Christian Jews were not accepted

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,080
 by their own people.

193
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,080
 They were not accepted by their own people

194
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,920
 because of their faith and devotion to Jesus Christ.

195
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,740
 Have you ever been challenged to believe Jesus Christ

196
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,140
 in the midst of people not accepting you?

197
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:43,760
 My father, he was the first person

198
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,060
 to be a Christian in his family.

199
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,880
 And he came to know Jesus because he went to a Christian,

200
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,280
 a Christian school in Hong Kong.

201
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,380
 And then, hi dad, by the way.

202
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,760
 He's always listening.

203
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,680
 He had a scare.

204
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,400
 The first scare was that Bruce Lee died, right?

205
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,880
 Bruce Lee, how could Bruce Lee die of cancer?

206
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,440
 He looks like he's invincible in these Hong Kong movies.

207
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
 And then the second scare that he had,

208
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,720
 he had this sort of, yeah,

209
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,840
 some sort of tumor on his hand, on his wrist.

210
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,280
 And he was very scared that he himself

211
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,040
 possibly had a tumor and had cancer.

212
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,320
 And those two things led him to Jesus Christ.

213
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,480
 And my dad is a very intellectual, brilliant person.

214
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,040
 And he had inspiration, inspiration to become a doctor,

215
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,720
 to be an engineer, all those Asian jobs, right?

216
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,960
 And so when he told my grandparents, his parents,

217
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,200
 that he was gonna go to seminary,

218
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,900
 my dad threatened to kick him out of the house.

219
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,160
 My grandma was on her knees begging,

220
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

221
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,000
 Don't go, don't go.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And yet my dad chose to follow Jesus Christ.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,160
 And he became the first in his family to know Jesus Christ.

224
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,600
 And his obedience to Christ is a big reason

225
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,360
 why I choose to follow Jesus Christ.

226
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,640
 Are we willing to follow Jesus Christ

227
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,880
 in the midst of persecution

228
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,640
 when the people around us do not accept us?

229
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,860
 Maybe our own families do not accept us.

230
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,080
 Are we willing to follow Jesus Christ?

231
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,280
 My dad did.

232
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,480
 And years later, when my grandparents came to Canada,

233
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,460
 they came to our church.

234
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,280
 And eventually, they gave their lives to Jesus Christ.

235
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,360
 (audience applauding)

236
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,200
 And so my grandparents, who are no longer with us,

237
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,760
 they are with the Lord in paradise.

238
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,320
 And I hope to see them once again.

239
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,880
 And I know I will see them once again, not I hope.

240
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,740
 I will see them.

241
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,360
 I will.

242
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,420
 I will see them.

243
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 (audience laughing)

244
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,680
 Poverty, persecution.

245
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,300
 And the last thing is the threat of prison.

246
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,320
 Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer.

247
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,240
 I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison

248
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,240
 to test you, and you will suffer persecution for 10 days.

249
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,380
 Prison.

250
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,640
 You know, prison nowadays,

251
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,440
 it might not be as bad as back then, all right?

252
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,360
 Back then, the Roman prisons were probably rat infested,

253
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,400
 feces everywhere, right?

254
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,260
 Little light, little food.

255
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,380
 Prison was not really a place that you would just be there

256
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,260
 for a short period of time.

257
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,980
 Prison was basically, you were gonna go to trial

258
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,740
 and possibly execution, right?

259
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,020
 It was a short-term stay.

260
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,580
 It wasn't like nowadays, you can be in prison for 10 years

261
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,340
 and survive and have some sort of survival.

262
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,900
 A lot of times, the Christians or the people

263
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,500
 that were in prison were later sent to the Colosseums

264
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,260
 where they would be eaten by animals

265
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,400
 in these war festivities.

266
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:10,660
 Prison was what Jesus said that they would face,

267
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,480
 that they would suffer.

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,040
 The devil would put some of you in prison

269
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,000
 because of your faith in Jesus Christ.

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,820
 And it says here that you will suffer persecution

271
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,680
 for 10 days.

272
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,920
 Now, we don't know exactly what these 10 days means, right?

273
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,040
 It could literally mean 10 days.

274
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,040
 Some theologians think it could be a period,

275
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,220
 10-year period.

276
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,480
 Some thought, oh, it was following the Roman Caesars.

277
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
 There were 10 Caesars.

278
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,320
 It could possibly be those 10 Caesars.

279
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,880
 You're gonna suffer through those 10 Caesars.

280
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,860
 We don't know exactly.

281
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,520
 But they were gonna suffer persecution.

282
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,260
 And one of the people that suffered persecution

283
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,820
 was a pastor there called Polycarp.

284
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,940
 You guys heard of Polycarp?

285
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,940
 And he existed there from 69 to 156, 69 to 156.

286
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:16,300
 All right, Jesus died around 33 AD,

287
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,300
 so a period after Jesus where the church had been built up.

288
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,700
 And the story is this,

289
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,200
 that imperial worship became more and more prevalent

290
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,560
 in that city, right?

291
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,980
 So not only just worshiping the Roman gods,

292
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,740
 but worshiping Caesar, right?

293
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,880
 And so there was sort of this ritual

294
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,200
 that you would have to pay tribute to Caesar once a year.

295
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,780
 You would have to claim Caesar as God,

296
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,220
 give him incense, and then you could be off in your way.

297
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:58,100
 And the Christians at that time were not willing to do that.

298
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,940
 And Polycarp himself was not willing to do that.

299
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,020
 And so the Roman officials sent guards towards him

300
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,900
 to arrest him.

301
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,300
 And he was an old man by then.

302
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,220
 He had served the Lord faithfully.

303
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,360
 And he offered food to the guards

304
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,420
 and, you know, hope you guys are okay.

305
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,160
 And these guards start to feel sorry.

306
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,400
 This is an old man.

307
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,360
 We really have to take him to the officials.

308
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,720
 But eventually they wanted to do their job.

309
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,480
 And so they took Polycarp towards the authorities

310
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,720
 and the officials there.

311
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,420
 And the officials said, "Polycarp, are you going

312
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,060
 to claim Caesar as God?"

313
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,080
 And he said these famous words,

314
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,460
 "Eighty and six years have I served Christ,

315
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,700
 nor has he ever done me any harm.

316
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,620
 How then can I blaspheme my King who saved me?

317
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,020
 I bless thee

318
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,100
 for

319
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:18,540
 fordeigning me worthy of this day and this hour

320
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,620
 that I may be among thy martyrs

321
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,340
 and drink the cup of my Lord Jesus Christ."

322
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,700
 His famous words.

323
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,420
 "Eighty and six years have I served.

324
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,420
 How could I blaspheme my King who has saved me?"

325
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,720
 So usually they would be nailed to a stake and burned.

326
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,980
 Polycarp was like, "You don't need to nail me.

327
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,160
 Just tie my hands. I will stand there.

328
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
 I will not flee."

329
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,120
 And he stood there and they lit up,

330
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,840
 as you can see in the next slide,

331
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,700
 lit up a fire underneath him.

332
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,380
 And some witnesses said in history

333
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,420
 that this flame did not engulf him.

334
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,740
 It burned, but it did not engulf him.

335
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,120
 Just like Daniel and Daniel's friends

336
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,960
 when he was challenged by Nebuchadnezzar.

337
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,380
 The flame did not burn him.

338
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,400
 It was a miracle.

339
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
 And then a soldier who was nearby,

340
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,880
 you see the soldier right there,

341
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,240
 he took his spear and stabbed him.

342
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,240
 And that is how he gave his life to Christ as a martyr.

343
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,020
 He gave his life to Christ just as Jesus said

344
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,300
 that some of you would be put in prison.

345
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,620
 Some of you would suffer and he did.

346
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,180
 And we see this church here,

347
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,580
 the three challenges that they went through.

348
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,380
 The first challenge was poverty.

349
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,380
 All right, they were rejected by the Romans.

350
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,540
 The people around them did not offer them jobs.

351
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,740
 They would not trade with them.

352
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,380
 They dealt with persecution,

353
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,140
 rejected by the Jews, their own people.

354
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,020
 These people, they're cannibals.

355
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,020
 These people, they're going against the Roman systems.

356
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,660
 The challenge of prison,

357
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,740
 they were rejected by the authorities

358
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,300
 who said you need to pay tribute to Caesar as God.

359
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,640
 And yet they stayed faithful.

360
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,280
 Jesus says they were experiencing poverty,

361
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,100
 yet they are rich because their treasure is in heaven.

362
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,700
 They were being persecuted by their own people,

363
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,700
 yet Jesus Christ accepts them into the family of Christ.

364
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,840
 We sang, we are a child of God.

365
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,400
 And they faced imprisonment,

366
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,360
 yet they were free in Jesus Christ.

367
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,760
 They were rich, accepted and free.

368
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,780
 What an amazing church.

369
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,980
 And I hope that is our church,

370
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,380
 that we would be rich in Christ,

371
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,260
 be a church that is a family of God,

372
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,180
 accepted by Christ as children of God.

373
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,940
 And we are free in Christ

374
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,760
 to go and proclaim his message wherever he calls us to.

375
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,060
 The Roman authorities could not hold this church,

376
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,080
 imprison them.

377
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,500
 And I hope that we, no matter who is going against us,

378
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 that we would boldly proclaim the message of Christ,

379
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,740
 the gospel of Christ,

380
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,620
 rich, accepted and free.

381
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,140
 Amazing.

382
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,380
 And Jesus says this to finish off his letter to Smyrna,

383
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,180
 "Be faithful even to the point of death,

384
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,620
 and I will give you life as your victor's crown.

385
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,140
 Whoever has ears,

386
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,580
 let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

387
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,300
 The one who is victorious

388
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,760
 will not be hurt at all by the second death."

389
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,260
 Jesus says, "Be faithful.

390
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,840
 I will give you life as a victor's crown."

391
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,920
 Now, who wears crowns?

392
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,740
 Who wears crowns?

393
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,820
 Royalty, right?

394
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,200
 The Queen of England, right?

395
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,360
 Back then, who else wore crowns?

396
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,560
 A victor's crown.

397
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,640
 Those who competed

398
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,320
 in the games.

399
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,400
 The winners would get the victor's crown.

400
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,320
 And these Christians in Smyrna,

401
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,640
 nobody thought they were royalty.

402
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,960
 Nobody thought they were winning.

403
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
 They were poor.

404
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,240
 They were outcasted.

405
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,960
 But in Jesus' eyes, they were winners.

406
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,800
 They deserved a crown,

407
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,920
 a victor's crown,

408
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,760
 because of their faithfulness to Jesus.

409
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,240
 And Jesus here is saying,

410
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,720
 "Be faithful to the point of death,

411
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 and I will give you life as a victor's crown."

412
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,720
 And so the message for the Church of Smyrna

413
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,080
 2,000 years ago,

414
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,880
 it's also a message to us.

415
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,680
 Are we willing to follow Jesus?

416
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,200
 Are you willing to follow Jesus

417
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,640
 in the midst of hardship,

418
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,760
 in the midst of poverty,

419
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,840
 in the face of poverty?

420
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,080
 Are we willing to follow Jesus?

421
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,760
 When there's temptations to take bribes,

422
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,760
 just like my friend from Toronto, who now works here,

423
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,920
 are we willing to follow Jesus, stand for Jesus?

424
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,520
 In the midst of being outcasted and persecution,

425
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
 are we willing to follow Jesus?

426
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,880
 My dad was facing persecution from his own father.

427
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,960
 If you go to seminary, I will kick you out of the house.

428
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,440
 But he was willing to obey Christ.

429
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,640
 And we see the fruit of his labor.

430
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,840
 Are we willing to go to the ends of the earth

431
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,200
 to share the love of Christ?

432
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,760
 There will be trials and tribulations.

433
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,120
 Jesus tells us that.

434
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,040
 If they persecuted me, will they not persecute you?

435
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,840
 Following Christ will not always be easy,

436
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,520
 but it will be worth it.

437
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,560
 Because where our treasure is, our heart is also.

438
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,400
 Will you choose victory in Christ

439
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,520
 or will you choose to be a victim?

440
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,720
 Oh, I feel sorry for myself.

441
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,280
 I'm a victim, you know.

442
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,440
 Or will we claim victory in Christ

443
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,960
 who has died and resurrected from death

444
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,080
 so that we could have a relationship with him?

445
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,560
 I'm gonna invite the praise team to come up

446
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,360
 as we close in prayer.

447
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,400
 Heavenly Father, we come before you.

448
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,200
 We thank you for what you have done on the cross.

449
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,320
 You have purchased for us a place in heaven.

450
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,160
 You have restored for us a relationship with you

451
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,800
 that was once lost.

452
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,480
 And Heavenly Father, I pray that you would help us

453
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,320
 in our situation, whatever we're facing,

454
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,720
 to be faithful to you,

455
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,280
 whether in our jobs, whether in our family,

456
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,800
 in whatever circumstances.

457
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,200
 Maybe we're being outcasted as a Christian.

458
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,640
 Oh, you Christian.

459
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,960
 They say at school or at work or wherever,

460
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,120
 but we would stand firm

461
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,560
 because your spirit gives us strength.

462
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,800
 Help us, Lord, in our weakness

463
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,040
 to be faithful to you,

464
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,080
 that we would one day go to heaven

465
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,800
 and you would say, "Good and faithful servant."

466
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,200
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

467
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,700
 Amen.

468
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:43,700
