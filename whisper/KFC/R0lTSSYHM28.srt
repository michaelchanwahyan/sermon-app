1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 It was quite an exam.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,900
 It felt like an exam coming back to Hong Kong.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,800
 It felt like, oh, I had to pass these tests and these tests to move on.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,200
 And I was racing with Agnes and Vincent to see who would come in first, you know, on this exam.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,800
 And it was quite an adventure, you know, landing at 11.30 p.m.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,000
 And arriving at the hotel five hours later.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
 And it was quite a journey.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,800
 And I'm glad that God has brought me back safe.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,700
 And I'm glad to be able to preach with you tonight as well.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,300
 And so let us pray together.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,700
 And we're going to start today's sermon.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,900
 Father, we thank you for this time that we can listen to your word.

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,800
 And we just ask that, Lord, you would fill me with the spirit that I would preach you, preach your word according to your spirit.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,600
 And I pray that, Lord, you would be with everyone here as well, that you would open their eyes and their ears and that spirit would speak to them personally tonight.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,500
 In Christ's name we pray.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,100
 Amen.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,000
 All right.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,600
 So I don't know if you've heard of BFF, right?

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:22,400
 When I was small and I was young, small and young, yes, I've always wanted to have a BFF, right?

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,100
 When you were growing up in secondary school, everybody had a BFF, right?

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,500
 And the thing was, I'm an only child.

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:37,100
 So because I'm an only child, my communication skills and making friends, I wasn't as fluid as I am now.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,700
 It doesn't mean basketball fan forever.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,900
 It can mean that.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,200
 Thank you, Mark.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,500
 But I wanted to have a BFF.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,200
 Everybody around me was having BFFs.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,700
 Even uncool people were having BFFs, all right?

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,500
 And so I wanted to have a BFF.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:09,300
 And it wasn't until like maybe like when I was 12 or 13, I started learning how to listen to people, care for people, how to, you know, make jokes and really just communicate.

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,200
 That's when I started to have best friends.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:19,900
 And I thought, whoa, it's so cool to have a best friend, to have connection with people.

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:31,400
 And Melanie Trump, not Melanie Trump, Melinda Gates says this, deep human connection is the purpose and result of a meaningful life.

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,700
 And it will inspire the most amazing acts of love, generosity, and humanity.

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,200
 And this was a picture of us.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,600
 You see how happy JP is in this photo.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,700
 We did this photo in the Philippines, actually.

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,700
 And it was one of our -- before we left, we wanted a nice photo together.

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,700
 And this was showing our connection together.

40
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:01,700
 And God created us for connection.

41
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:12,700
 When he first created us, when he first created Adam, he had a personal relationship with him, a personal connection with him.

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,700
 He was made in God's image.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
 And we are also made in God's image.

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:29,700
 And we have this connection with the Lord, not just with others and humans around us, but with God himself, a spiritual connection.

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,700
 And not only did God create a relationship with him, a connection with him, but he also created marriage.

46
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
 Right?

47
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,700
 Adam and Eve, they married.

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,700
 And then they had a child.

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,700
 And Adam and Eve, they married.

50
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,700
 And they became one.

51
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
 The two became one flesh.

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,700
 And from there, from marriage, became a family.

53
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
 And when Jesus came, he started the church.

54
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,700
 And the church family came about.

55
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
 And there's a church connection, a church family in your clans.

56
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
 You're connecting together.

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,700
 When we're here in fellowship, we're connecting together.

58
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,700
 When we're praying after the service, we're connecting together.

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,700
 And there's also connection outside of the church.

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,700
 And that is in our society with our friends as well.

61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,700
 Connection provides us intimacy, support, and promotes sharing.

62
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:40,700
 When we have healthy relationships, right, when we have a healthy marriage, that creates the stability for a healthy marriage, for a healthy family.

63
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,700
 And that healthy family helps to create the building blocks for a healthy church together.

64
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:55,700
 And this healthy church helps to create a connection for a healthy society and a healthy country.

65
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,700
 Healthy relationships produce fruit.

66
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,700
 Healthy relationships produce fruit.

67
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,700
 And we see what happens in Genesis chapter 3.

68
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,700
 When this relationship with God was broken, when Adam and Eve sinned, what happened?

69
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,700
 What was the result?

70
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
 They hid themselves, right?

71
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,700
 Like some of you guys are hiding on Zoom right now.

72
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
 You're hiding.

73
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
 I'm joking.

74
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,700
 I'm sure there's nothing to be ashamed of.

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:32,700
 What happened was Adam and Eve, they hid themselves because they were naked, because they felt guilty.

76
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,700
 They thought that, oh, no, God would be unhappy.

77
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
 And they hid themselves.

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
 They isolated themselves.

79
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
 And there was a disconnection.

80
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,700
 And this disconnection is what we in Christianity call sin.

81
00:05:49,700 --> 00:06:02,700
 Sin separates us from God because we choose to go our own way, because we choose to have things that are other than what God wants for us.

82
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
 We have sin.

83
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,700
 And that separates us from a perfect, holy, loving God.

84
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,700
 And when this connection fails, there is unhealthy fruit in our lives.

85
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,700
 Unhealthy fruit in our lives.

86
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:26,700
 And we see this need for connection over these two years especially, right?

87
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,700
 Because we have been having COVID.

88
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,700
 And the need for connection is even greater.

89
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:39,700
 And that's why it's so amazing that we have technology like Zoom to allow us to still connect.

90
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,700
 And Jesus also promises us connection.

91
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,700
 And we thank you, Bonnie, for reading this for us before.

92
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,700
 That Jesus says, I am the true vine and the Father is the gardener.

93
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,700
 He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit.

94
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:03,700
 While every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.

95
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,700
 Why does Jesus say here that he is the true vine?

96
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,700
 Why does it say he is the true vine?

97
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,700
 It's because earlier God also sent a vine.

98
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,700
 And that was the vine of Israel.

99
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
 Right?

100
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
 In Psalms chapter 80, it says this.

101
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,700
 You transplanted a vine from Egypt.

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,700
 You drove out the nations and planted it.

103
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
 You cleared the ground for it.

104
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
 And it took root.

105
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
 And it filled the land.

106
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:46,700
 The problem with this vine was that later it sinned.

107
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,700
 It went against God.

108
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,700
 It went its own separate way.

109
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,700
 And that is why Jesus says he is the true vine.

110
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,700
 It was a new vine that was needed, a new covenant that was needed.

111
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,700
 And that came through Jesus Christ, this new covenant.

112
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,700
 And Jesus challenges us here.

113
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
 It says here before, right?

114
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
 I am the vine.

115
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
 You are the branches.

116
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,700
 If you remain in me and I remain in you, you will bear much fruit.

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,700
 If you remain apart from me, you can do nothing.

118
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,700
 And when does Jesus say this?

119
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:37,700
 This was when during the last supper, Judas had went out and he was already

120
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,700
 planning to betray Jesus with three silver coins.

121
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,700
 And what was left was him with his disciples.

122
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,700
 And he says this to them.

123
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
 That he is the vine.

124
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,700
 And that you guys, the branches, the disciples are the branches.

125
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
 Remain in me.

126
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,700
 And I will remain in you.

127
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,700
 And Jesus says this word remain.

128
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
 Or in other translations, it's abide.

129
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,700
 It means find a home.

130
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
 To find a relationship.

131
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,700
 To find a relationship, dependence on Jesus Christ.

132
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,700
 And Jesus invites us into a deep unity and communication.

133
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,700
 Community found in the Trinity.

134
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
 God is love.

135
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,700
 Right?

136
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,700
 And if God is love, it means because he has relationships to love.

137
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,700
 God is love because God in the Trinity is perfect in relationship.

138
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
 Perfect in love.

139
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,700
 And God invites us to connect back to him.

140
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
 Through Jesus Christ.

141
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,700
 And so how do we remain in Jesus?

142
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,700
 How do we remain in Jesus?

143
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:08,700
 Remaining in Jesus will take away this problem of sin and reunite us with Christ, with God once again.

144
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,700
 And that we would have peace with God once again.

145
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,700
 The first thing he mentions is this.

146
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,700
 That the father is the gardener.

147
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
 The father is the gardener.

148
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
 And what does the father do?

149
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,700
 He takes care of every branch in me that bears no fruit.

150
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,700
 Has anybody had a plant before?

151
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
 Has anybody had a plant before?

152
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
 Raise your arms.

153
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
 Yeah?

154
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
 Paul has had one.

155
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
 Melanie?

156
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
 How did the plants do?

157
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
 Did they survive?

158
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
 Did they survive or did they wither?

159
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,700
 If you went to my office, I love orchids.

160
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,700
 And Mark is raising his virtual hand as well.

161
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
 If you went to my office, I used to have orchid there.

162
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
 And I love orchids.

163
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
 I think they're beautiful.

164
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:09,700
 And eventually, you know, I wasn't at the office to water them every week or I don't even know how much you're supposed to water them.

165
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
 So I was a bad gardener.

166
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,700
 You know?

167
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
 I was a bad gardener.

168
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,700
 And these orchids died.

169
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:28,700
 And the thing is, even though we're bad gardeners, Jesus says the first thing here is the father is the gardener.

170
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,700
 And he isn't a gardener that's going to forget about the tree or the vine.

171
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:42,700
 He's not going to be a gardener that over feeds or over fertilizes so that, you know, the tree, I don't know, goes chaotic.

172
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,700
 And if you fertilize too much, it dies as well.

173
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,700
 The father is the gardener.

174
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
 And that is our first comfort.

175
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,700
 That is Jesus' first comfort, that he takes care of us.

176
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
 And how does he take care of us?

177
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
 There's a process called pruning.

178
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
 Okay?

179
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
 There's a process called pruning.

180
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,700
 And if you guys don't know what pruning is, well, you remove some of the branches.

181
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:16,700
 You see here in the diagram here, you remove some of the branches that sort of take away from the nutrients of the big branch.

182
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
 Right?

183
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:24,700
 So it could be removing short little branches that aren't productive.

184
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,700
 It could be removing dead or broken limbs from the trees that aren't going to produce any fruit as well.

185
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:38,700
 It could be removing, you know, a single trunk that is not going to be productive or sprouts in the bottom.

186
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,700
 I remember I went to high school one day, and my gym teacher brought this whole big basket of peaches.

187
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,700
 And the peaches was like this big.

188
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
 And I ate into it, and it was so fruitful.

189
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:58,700
 And everybody, just imagine eating the most fruitful, juicy, sweet peach that they've ever had.

190
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
 Okay?

191
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,700
 It could look like one of those really expensive Japanese ones, but they were from Ontario.

192
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:11,700
 And my gym teacher was telling us, "These peaches, I grew them.

193
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:23,700
 I own a farm, and I have this big hose, and I shoot water from my pond, and I water my peach trees, and then I do a process called pruning."

194
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
 And so he has this branch, and he was like, "I go like this.

195
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:51,700
 I literally do this, and I take out the little sprouts that aren't going to be productive, that take away from the nutrients from the trunk, so that the branches that are productive will have these big, juicy, sweet, amazing peaches, the best peaches I've ever had."

196
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,700
 And that is the first thing that Jesus promises us.

197
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,700
 How do we abide in Christ?

198
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
 How do we remain with him?

199
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:15,700
 We need to trust that the Father is the gardener, and the gardener will prune and take away the things in our life that are unfruitful, that are unfruitful.

200
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:25,700
 And I remember when I was growing up, you know, when I was growing up, I was this kid that just wanted to have fun.

201
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,700
 If you couldn't keep up, I would leave you behind.

202
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,700
 For example, if we were hiking, and you couldn't keep up, I would see you later, all right?

203
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,700
 I wouldn't be that shepherd that waits for you, you know, that makes sure you're okay.

204
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
 Do you have enough water?

205
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
 Oh, did you get hurt?

206
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 Let's wait a little bit.

207
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
 No, I'm off to have fun.

208
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,700
 But Jesus started pruning the selfishness within me.

209
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,700
 Jesus says, "Love me.

210
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,700
 Love others before yourself."

211
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,700
 And so I started caring about others.

212
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,700
 I started concerning myself with others.

213
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,700
 As I got to know God more, he gave me self-control.

214
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:23,700
 He took away the things that I couldn't control, that fun, you know, that I couldn't control.

215
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
 He gave me self-control.

216
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,700
 He pruned some of the things in my life, this selfishness that I couldn't control.

217
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,700
 He pruned it away so that I would be more faithful, so that I would care about others.

218
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,700
 I would place myself before others.

219
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 So the first thing that Jesus says is that he has a father.

220
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
 That is the gardener.

221
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,700
 And this gardener takes care of this vine.

222
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:02,700
 The second thing that Jesus says is that we need to keep the word of God.

223
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,700
 You are already clean because of the word I've spoken to you.

224
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:16,700
 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

225
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,700
 Keep the word of God.

226
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,700
 The word of the Lord endures forever.

227
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,700
 The word of the Lord endures forever.

228
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:42,700
 I was, you know, attending the University of YouTube, the University of YouTube, and it talked about this thing that was like, oh, if you do visualization, then you can become even more successful.

229
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,700
 You know, the University of YouTube, it just keeps playing videos after videos after videos, right?

230
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
 And so I was like, this is pretty cool.

231
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,700
 It talked about the reticular activating system.

232
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,700
 And what that is is that it filters out information.

233
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
 It blocks out other information.

234
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
 Okay?

235
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:09,700
 So, for example, when you're scrolling down Facebook or Instagram, you instantly -- things instantly pop out, right?

236
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,700
 Things that, oh, you find are interesting eventually pop out.

237
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,700
 And do you know who controls what you filter?

238
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,700
 You control what you filter.

239
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:33,700
 As you're looking at Instagram and Facebook right now and you're scrolling through what is important, what -- what -- what decides what is important, what you look at?

240
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
 It is you.

241
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
 It is you.

242
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
 You decide.

243
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:50,700
 If you decide, oh, you know, sports is going to make me happy, then sporty things are going to pop up and you're going to look for sporty things because that's what you've sort of activated in your mind.

244
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,700
 That sports is interesting and that sports is going to intrigue me.

245
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:04,700
 If you find that, oh, only people with amazing jobs, they're going to be happy, then that's going to be sort of the mindset that you have.

246
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,700
 People are successful when they have a happy, good job.

247
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,700
 And so if I don't have a good, happy job, then I'm going to be all very down on myself because I don't have that sort of thing.

248
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,700
 We decide what we filter.

249
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
 We choose what we allow in our mind.

250
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,700
 And that is why it's so powerful.

251
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:32,700
 When we allow the Lord, the word of the Lord to come into our mind, to change our mind.

252
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:41,700
 Paul says, right, that there's a transformation that happens when we allow God to come into our mind.

253
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:57,700
 When we seek the Lord and we seek peace, true peace, true goodness, true satisfaction from the Lord, we start to change our mind to be able to seek after these things from the Lord.

254
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,700
 Our mind changes.

255
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:10,700
 I remember when I was attending the University of Toronto and I would commute every day.

256
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:17,700
 It was almost an hour commute by bus or these are trams, they called it.

257
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,700
 An hour every day to the University of Toronto.

258
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:30,700
 And I started devoting myself to reading the word of the Lord every day when I was commuting.

259
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:39,700
 It didn't matter if there were some funny people on the bus or it was really crowded or it was rush hour or whatever.

260
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,700
 I would just read the word of the Lord every day.

261
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
 On the bus.

262
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:56,700
 And slowly I saw that God transformed my mind as I filled my life with his word every day.

263
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,700
 My values changed.

264
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,700
 My priorities started to change.

265
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,700
 Instead of it being about me, I started to value serving the Lord more and more.

266
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:19,700
 Instead of valuing myself, I started valuing God more and more and then serving God and others' feelings more and more.

267
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:29,700
 And God changed my mind as I filled my life and filled my mind with his word.

268
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,700
 If you keep his word, you will abide in Christ.

269
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,700
 The third thing that Jesus says is obey his commands.

270
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,700
 As the father has loved me, so I have loved you.

271
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700
 So now remain in my love.

272
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,700
 As the father has loved me, so I have loved you.

273
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:58,700
 You will remain in my love just as I have kept my father's commands and remain in his love.

274
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,700
 Jesus sets an example for us of obedience.

275
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,700
 Leaving his throne in heaven to become one of us.

276
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,700
 To become flesh.

277
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,700
 He obeyed the father.

278
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,700
 He obeyed the father to the cross.

279
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,700
 To the suffering of the cross.

280
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:34,700
 And Jesus also calls us that if we are to abide in him, to remain in him, to have real connection, we must obey him.

281
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,700
 Because he, the father, is the gardener.

282
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
 The perfect gardener.

283
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
 He knows what is best for us.

284
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,700
 So if we obey him, we will become more like Christ.

285
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,700
 And we will walk in his perfect plan.

286
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,700
 And one of those steps of obedience I took was coming to Hong Kong.

287
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
 Right?

288
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:15,700
 Just like James coming from the UK to Hong Kong, I came from Toronto, leaving my Toronto Raptors, leaving my live sports to come to Hong Kong.

289
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,700
 Because God gave me a calling to serve here.

290
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,700
 To build up the next generation.

291
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,700
 We are the north.

292
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,700
 And I was obedient to his calling.

293
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,700
 I didn't know exactly what happened.

294
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,700
 I didn't know exactly what was going to happen.

295
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
 Coming to Hong Kong.

296
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
 Would I find a place to live?

297
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,700
 I didn't know what was going to happen.

298
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,700
 With serving at the church here.

299
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
 I didn't know.

300
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
 But I was obedient.

301
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
 And God called me.

302
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,700
 And he said to me, if you follow me, what is there to worry about?

303
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,700
 You are following the king of kings.

304
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,700
 Trust and obey.

305
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
 And that's what I did.

306
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
 Trust and obey.

307
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
 And the last thing.

308
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,700
 How do we remain in Christ?

309
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
 What happens when we remain in Christ?

310
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,700
 We will bear fruit.

311
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,700
 The branches on its own.

312
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,700
 If you cut off branches on its own, what will happen?

313
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
 It will slowly die.

314
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,700
 It will slowly wither away.

315
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,700
 And the branches are fully dependent on the vine.

316
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
 For nutrients.

317
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,700
 For water.

318
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,700
 And what happens is when they get nutrients and water.

319
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,700
 They become fruitful.

320
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,700
 They become fruitful.

321
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,700
 And Jesus says here, no branch can bear fruit by itself.

322
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,700
 It must remain in the vine.

323
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,700
 And no other can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.

324
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,700
 Just as dependent as branches are to the vine.

325
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,700
 We are dependent on Christ.

326
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,700
 And you know, just preparing this talk is such a great reminder for

327
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
 myself.

328
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
 Even those in ministry.

329
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
 Especially those in ministry.

330
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,700
 We are serving the Lord every day.

331
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,700
 And it's so easy for us, you know, to start just depending on

332
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
 ourselves.

333
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,700
 Depending on ourselves to connect with this person.

334
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
 Depending on ourselves to help this person.

335
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
 Depending on ourselves to serve.

336
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
 To preach.

337
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 And God is reminding each one of us.

338
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,700
 And reminding me.

339
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,700
 That I am Jesus Christ.

340
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,700
 I can do nothing.

341
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,700
 That my motivations aren't right.

342
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,700
 That my life won't be right without Christ.

343
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,700
 We need Jesus Christ.

344
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,700
 And when we depend on Jesus Christ.

345
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
 As we are serving him.

346
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
 Dependent on him.

347
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
 We will bear fruit.

348
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,700
 And we will be able to get this, you know, this camp that we had.

349
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
 Explorer camp in 2018.

350
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
 Wow.

351
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
 2018.

352
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,700
 That seems like so far ago.

353
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,700
 You see some of these students that we had.

354
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
 We have Carmen here.

355
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
 Grew up in SEP.

356
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
 Became an intern.

357
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
 And then worked as an administrator.

358
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
 At Explorer.

359
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,700
 And now is studying for seminary.

360
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
 We are bearing fruit.

361
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
 We are bearing fruit.

362
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,700
 Charmaine, the girl on the left.

363
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,700
 She grew up in Explorer.

364
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
 Hadn't really served before.

365
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
 Started serving after this camp.

366
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,700
 Went on Philippines mission trip with us.

367
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,700
 Shared the gospel and led somebody to Christ for the first time.

368
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,700
 And then she is a mentor.

369
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
 In our Titus fellowship.

370
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,700
 A lot of these kids have grown up and become ambassadors in our

371
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
 Explorer worship.

372
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
 God has helped us.

373
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,700
 To become fruitful.

374
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,700
 And when we remain in him and when we obey him.

375
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
 We see the fruit.

376
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
 That he bears.

377
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
 We see the fruit.

378
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
 That he bears.

379
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,700
 And so once again.

380
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,700
 Let us remain in Christ.

381
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,700
 And as we remain in Christ.

382
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,700
 We have a father that will take care of us.

383
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,700
 And this father will prune away.

384
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,700
 Take away the things that aren't fruitful.

385
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
 As we remain in Christ.

386
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,700
 We keep his word in our mind.

387
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,700
 We live his word.

388
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,700
 Live out his word.

389
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
 As we remain in Christ.

390
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
 We are obedient.

391
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,700
 We trust and obey him.

392
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,700
 And when we remain in Christ.

393
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,700
 The result is there is fruit.

394
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:30,700
 The fruit of our labors.

395
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
 And the biggest challenge for us today.

396
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:40,700
 Is that we fully depend on him.

397
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,700
 What area of your life.

398
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,700
 Is Christ challenging you tonight.

399
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,700
 To remain in him.

400
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,700
 Are there areas in your life tonight.

401
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,700
 That you know God is trying to prune.

402
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,700
 Are there areas of disobedience.

403
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,700
 Or sin in your life.

404
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,700
 That God is calling you specifically.

405
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,700
 To take away.

406
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,700
 Would you surrender that to the Lord.

407
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,700
 Tonight.

408
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,700
 Are there areas in your life.

409
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,700
 That you haven't let the word.

410
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,700
 Do you not let the word of God.

411
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,700
 To be in his word daily.

412
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,700
 God is challenging you to remain in him.

413
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,700
 By spending time in the word.

414
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,700
 Spending time in the word.

415
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,700
 Will change your life.

416
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,700
 And change your mind.

417
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
 And transform the way you think.

418
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,700
 Are there areas in your life.

419
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,700
 That God wants you to remain in him.

420
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,700
 By obeying him.

421
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,700
 There is a certain.

422
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,700
 Crossroad you are at.

423
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,700
 God is challenging you.

424
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,700
 To obey him.

425
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,700
 Trust him.

426
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,700
 Are you willing to remain in Christ.

427
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,700
 By obeying the direction.

428
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,700
 That he is calling you to.

429
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,700
 Are you producing fruit.

430
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,700
 A good tree produces good fruit.

431
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,700
 That is what Jesus says.

432
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,700
 What fruit are you producing in your life.

433
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,700
 Your fruit.

434
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
 Will show you what kind of tree.

435
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,700
 You are.

436
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,700
 Are people coming to know Jesus through you.

437
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,700
 Are people being discipled through you.

438
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,700
 Are people being fed the word of God.

439
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,700
 Through your life.

440
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,700
 If they are.

441
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,700
 It is a sign that you are remaining.

442
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,700
 In Christ.

443
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,700
 We are going to respond with a song now.

444
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,700
 It is called.

445
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 Not through me.

446
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,700
 Not through I.

447
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
 Not through you.

448
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,700
 It is fully dependent on Christ.

449
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
 Surrendering to Christ.

450
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,700
 Everything that we have.

451
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,700
 That is what the branch.

452
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,700
 Does to the vine.

453
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
 It is fully dependent on the vine.

454
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,700
 Jesus is asking us.

455
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,700
 To be fully dependent on him.

456
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,500
 so that we can bear much fruit.

457
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:52,500
