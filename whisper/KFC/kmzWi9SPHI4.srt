1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,520
 - All right, thank you very much.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,440
 That was an awesome video.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,280
 It is great to be connecting with all of you tonight.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,480
 And we are continuing our series on Advent.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,220
 We are talking about mighty God, mighty God.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,120
 And just like we read and we saw the video just now,

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,600
 for to us a Christ, a child is born

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,640
 and he shall be called wonderful counselor,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,480
 mighty God, everlasting father and prince of peace.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,520
 So here's the first discussion question.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,680
 This is gonna be a more interactive,

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,840
 yeah, more interactive sermon.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,840
 What comes to mind when you think of Jesus as mighty God?

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,800
 I want you to type into the chat, what comes to mind?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,880
 What are the first couple of things that come to mind

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,080
 when you think of Jesus as mighty God?

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,480
 I wanna see some of your answers.

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,080
 Son of God, yes, absolutely.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
 Thank you, Agnes.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,000
 Yeah, what others?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,440
 Maybe anybody else?

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,840
 Power, very good.

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,720
 Yeah, he's powerful, absolutely.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,400
 All right, what comes to mind?

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,960
 Anybody else?

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
 What comes to mind?

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
 Salvation, absolutely.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,400
 Yeah, the power to save us, very good.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,040
 Others?

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,800
 Yeah, sovereign, very good.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,240
 Love, yeah, unstoppable, very cool.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,320
 Yeah, great answers, unconditional.

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,800
 Absolutely, creator, absolutely.

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,920
 Yeah, thank you so much for those answers.

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,360
 That's very good.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,040
 So this, let me go back to the slide.

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
 What comes to mind?

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,960
 This word is El Gabor.

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,800
 It comes from the Hebrew word,

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,600
 and this Gabor, it means it could be strong,

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,080
 it could be mighty.

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,200
 Some people even interpret it as hero, mighty hero.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,520
 You know, hero God, he transforms hearts.

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
 I see your answer, it's very good.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,080
 King of kings, very good.

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,880
 Let's look into the story of the nativity.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,640
 Let's look at Luke chapter two.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
 Could Jesus be mighty God?

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,600
 And we'll see as he comes to earth.

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,320
 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,920
 in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,520
 because he belonged to the house and line of David.

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,760
 He went there to register with Mary,

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,040
 who was pledged to be married to him

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,680
 and was expecting a child.

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,720
 While they were there,

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
 the time came for the baby to be born.

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,880
 And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,960
 She wrapped him in clothes and placed him in a manger

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,840
 because there was no guest room available for them.

62
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,080
 Could Jesus be mighty God?

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,200
 Could Jesus be mighty God?

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,520
 We see here that there was no room available for him.

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,600
 For a mighty God, there was no room available?

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,680
 Could that be?

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,200
 I mean, a manger, has anybody been to a manger before?

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,640
 I've been walking past, you know, Happy Valley,

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
 the Jockey Club where there's the horse races

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,960
 and the horses, and you smell sort of the horses

71
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
 at the stable.

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
 Does it smell good?

73
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,000
 It might smell better than your washroom, hopefully, right?

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
 Have you been in a chicken farm?

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
 Have you been in a sheep farm?

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Does it smell good?

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,400
 I hope that, you know, congratulations to Josh and Mel.

78
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,560
 Their baby wasn't born in a manger, was it?

79
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,200
 It was born in a beautiful hospital,

80
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,320
 nicely clean and sanitized.

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,800
 That Jesus, a mighty God,

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,400
 born with no room available?

83
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,480
 And where was he born?

84
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,480
 He's born in a dirty place with horse poop and chicken poop.

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,600
 You know, it probably did not smell nice.

86
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,040
 So there was no birthplace for this mighty God.

87
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,960
 And what else?

88
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,280
 We see that he was pursued by King Herod, right?

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,440
 King Herod sent men after him.

90
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,160
 He was not accepted by his own people.

91
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,960
 It says in John chapter one

92
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,960
 that his own people did not recognize him.

93
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,200
 His own people did not recognize him.

94
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,760
 This mighty God was not accepted.

95
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,360
 And lastly, we see that this mighty God had no home.

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,000
 He had to flee Joseph, Mary,

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,320
 and took Jesus to Egypt

98
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,320
 because King Herod was sending people to kill baby Jesus.

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,200
 They fled.

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,320
 They were refugees.

101
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,080
 Could this be a mighty God with such humble beginnings?

102
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,480
 No birthplace, no acceptance, no home.

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,200
 Today, we will see how Jesus is mighty God.

104
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,360
 He is mighty God over the physical realm.

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
 He is mighty God over the intellectual.

106
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,920
 He is mighty God, as we see in the next slide,

107
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
 through the emotional.

108
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,120
 Mighty God over the social and the spiritual.

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,680
 Firstly, I want us to discuss here in the chat once again,

110
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,680
 how do you see Jesus as mighty God over the physical realm?

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,560
 Are there any examples that comes to mind

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,280
 that Jesus is mighty God over the physical realm?

113
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,520
 Any examples?

114
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,880
 Yeah, he turns water into wine.

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,160
 That's so cool, right?

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,080
 He could transform the water molecules, the H2O,

117
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,360
 into what is the chemical balance of wine?

118
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
 Does anybody know?

119
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
 Uncle Vincent, should he know?

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,800
 Yeah, he changes storms, right?

121
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,120
 He calms the storms.

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
 That's so good.

123
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,760
 You guys should be preaching this.

124
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,200
 I mean, it shouldn't be me.

125
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,360
 Yeah, he heals people, the blind and the sick.

126
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
 Absolutely.

127
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,640
 Parting the Red Sea.

128
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,200
 That's an interesting one, Louis,

129
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,560
 because I think that might be Moses.

130
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
 That's an interesting one, but I'm sure Jesus could do it.

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
 I'm sure Jesus could part the Red Sea.

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,120
 I'm not sure he did that during his time on Earth.

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,240
 All right, let's look at how Jesus is mighty

134
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,840
 over the physical realm in our next slide.

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,840
 Firstly, we see that Jesus was mighty before his birth,

136
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,120
 before his birth.

137
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,480
 In John 1, verse three, it says that all things

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,840
 were made through him, and without him,

139
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,840
 nothing that was made, nothing was made that was made.

140
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,480
 It says very clearly here that all things

141
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
 were made through Jesus.

142
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,160
 He was active in creation, active in creation.

143
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,640
 We see the next slide, Colossians 1, verse 16.

144
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,160
 For by him, all things were created that are in heaven

145
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 and that are on Earth, right?

146
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,040
 Both visible and invisible, not just on Earth,

147
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,600
 but in heaven, oh my goodness, wow, right?

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,280
 Whether thrones or dominions, principalities or powers,

149
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,560
 all things were created through him and for him.

150
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,320
 Jesus is mighty God even before he was born,

151
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,000
 physically born on Earth.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,560
 And not only was he mighty God before he was born,

153
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,480
 he was mighty God during his time on Earth.

154
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,440
 Through all your examples, right, turning water into wine,

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,040
 through his resurrection, walking on water, right?

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,280
 You guys had some of these examples.

157
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 He had the power to turn H2O into this amazing wine.

158
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,060
 I'm sure his wine was better than all the Bordeaux's

159
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,160
 that you have, right?

160
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,520
 Right?

161
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,160
 All the Bordeaux's, all the beautiful wines in the world.

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
 Imagine how amazing Jesus' wine could have been.

163
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,080
 He calmed the storms, he commanded the storms to be clear.

164
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,920
 That's amazing.

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,520
 Imagine thunder just being silent.

166
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,960
 Imagine hailstorms turning into sunny,

167
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,920
 sunny, beautiful days.

168
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,120
 What an amazing, mighty God we have.

169
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,880
 He fed the 5,000.

170
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,840
 He commanded nothing into being, right?

171
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,000
 That's so cool that he could turn things,

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,360
 nothing into food.

173
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,200
 He can multiply bread into thousands of bread

174
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,160
 or thousands of fish.

175
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,840
 He healed the blind and the sick.

176
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,720
 He had command over diseases.

177
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
 Imagine Jesus changing, right?

178
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,080
 Changing the cells in your body,

179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
 turning them from good to bad.

180
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,000
 What an amazing, mighty God.

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 We could see right through the microscope

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,120
 how amazingly detailed diseases are.

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,120
 And Jesus knew how to turn those diseases into good cells

184
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,640
 or destroy the diseases.

185
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,600
 Amazing.

186
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
 What an amazing God that we have.

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,120
 How is God, next, how is God, mighty God

188
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
 over the intellectual realm?

189
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,260
 Any ideas, any thoughts?

190
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,000
 Please type in the chat.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,060
 I wanna hear your thoughts.

192
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,560
 How is God, how is Jesus mighty God

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 over the intellectual realm?

194
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,320
 Any thoughts?

195
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,360
 Come on, you got this.

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
 You got this.

197
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
 Anshan, you got this.

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,400
 I see you guys thinking.

199
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,320
 Julian, you have something good?

200
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,400
 Melanie, anything?

201
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,480
 How is Jesus mighty God over the intellectual realm?

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,720
 Any thoughts?

203
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,160
 Uncle Vincent is typing up an essay.

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,000
 I see him.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,720
 Never got trapped, absolutely.

206
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,800
 He never got trapped by the Pharisees, absolutely.

207
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,920
 Yeah, he is the way, the truth, and the light.

208
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,800
 Yeah, he proclaimed the truth, absolutely.

209
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,760
 Very good.

210
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
 We're gonna see, next slide,

211
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,840
 how Jesus is mighty God over the intellectual realm.

212
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,880
 Keep those comments coming.

213
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,120
 Always welcome.

214
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,320
 Jesus is mighty God over the intellectual realm,

215
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,640
 firstly, because of his knowledge of scripture.

216
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,480
 He had total control and knowledge of the word of God.

217
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,000
 And we see that, firstly, right, through his temptation.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,040
 When the devil took him to the mountains to test him,

219
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,720
 and the devil was saying all these scriptures,

220
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,720
 he always countered those scriptures with,

221
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,360
 for it is written, as we see in the next slide here,

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,880
 for it is written, worship the Lord your God,

223
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
 and serve him only.

224
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,840
 He always responded well with scripture,

225
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,840
 because he had command and total understanding of scripture.

226
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,440
 Also, we see that he was all-knowing, right?

227
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,080
 He interacted with the Samaritan woman.

228
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,800
 And what happened in his interaction

229
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,880
 with the Samaritan woman?

230
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,880
 He knew, he knew that the Samaritan woman was a doubt cast.

231
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,840
 He knew the Samaritan woman was unfaithful,

232
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,920
 and that this was actually his fifth or sixth husband.

233
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,640
 Right, he had all the knowledge.

234
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,680
 He knows our hearts.

235
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,560
 He knows your hearts.

236
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,440
 He is all-knowing.

237
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,280
 Not only that, we see, just like Florence said,

238
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,480
 he never got trapped by the Pharisees or Sadducees.

239
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,120
 His wisdom is greater than any human wisdom.

240
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,040
 He is mighty over the intellectual realm.

241
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,160
 Time and time again, the Pharisees tried to trap him, right?

242
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,760
 Will you offer taxes to Rome?

243
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,280
 And Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's," right?

244
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,160
 And give to God what is God's.

245
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,080
 And so we see that Jesus is mighty

246
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
 over the intellectual realm.

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,560
 Not only is he mighty over the intellectual realm,

248
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,440
 he's mighty over human emotions.

249
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 Over his own emotions is he mighty.

250
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,320
 And firstly, we see in the temptation of Jesus, right?

251
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
 The devil tempted him, right?

252
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,160
 He showed him, in the next slide, all the highest mountains.

253
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
 I'll give you all this.

254
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,200
 He tried to tempt Jesus with his eyes and say,

255
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,880
 look at this, do you want it, right?

256
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,520
 We always go window shopping,

257
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,120
 and the windows are full of all these things we want.

258
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,800
 But Jesus saw it and said, no, I will not be tempted.

259
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,640
 Away from me, Satan, for it is written,

260
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,360
 worship the Lord your God and serve him only.

261
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,360
 Jesus had the full weight, the full weight, you know,

262
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,800
 of the, full weight, right, on his body.

263
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
 Full weight of temptation on his body.

264
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 Yet he lifted it up, he lifted it up and was not tempted.

265
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,480
 He is mighty God over temptation.

266
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,800
 And we also see that Jesus is mighty over human emotions

267
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 because he was obedient to the cross, obedient to the cross.

268
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,720
 And it says in verse 38 of Matthew, chapter 26,

269
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,960
 "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

270
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,840
 "Stay here and keep watch with me."

271
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,160
 And he prayed to the Father,

272
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
 "My Father, if it is possible,

273
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,640
 "may this cup be taken away from me,

274
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,320
 "yet not as I will, but as you will."

275
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,520
 Yes, he was feeling the sorrow,

276
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,680
 but yet he was still willing to be obedient to the cross.

277
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,800
 And it says in Philippians chapter two, verse eight,

278
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,600
 "And being found in human form,

279
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,360
 "he humbled himself by being obedient

280
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,160
 "to the point of death."

281
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,400
 Even death on the cross.

282
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,880
 Jesus had the full weight of temptation on him.

283
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,880
 Yet he overcame, he overcame.

284
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,800
 All right, so we went through the physical,

285
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,720
 the intellectual, the emotional.

286
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 Now, next question, how is Jesus mighty God

287
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,760
 over his social environment?

288
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,880
 How is Jesus mighty God over his social environment?

289
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,680
 Put on your thinking caps.

290
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,680
 How is Jesus mighty God over his social environment?

291
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,340
 Any thoughts?

292
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,280
 I see some of you typing, some of you thinking.

293
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,400
 He reached out to the outcasts, very good, right?

294
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,680
 Back then and even now, right?

295
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,880
 We don't associate ourselves with those we think are sick

296
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,080
 or unclean or those with leprosy.

297
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
 You don't touch, right?

298
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,440
 You don't want to become unclean and have leprosy yourself.

299
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
 Brings in social outcasts, yes.

300
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,440
 Didn't get, yeah, overcome by peer pressure, very good.

301
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,240
 He ate with tax collectors and sinners, very good.

302
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,640
 You guys are awesome.

303
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
 Pastor John is very good with these answers.

304
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,360
 Let's, maybe he looked into my slides.

305
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,800
 I think that's what happened.

306
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 Let's look into the next slide,

307
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 how Jesus was mighty God over his social circumstances.

308
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,680
 He connected with women, right?

309
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,680
 Back then, women did not have position, couldn't be CEOs,

310
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,880
 couldn't maybe vote or own property back then,

311
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,200
 but Jesus connected with women, right?

312
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,480
 The Samaritan woman even questioned,

313
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,480
 how is it that you, a Jew, a man, a Jewish man,

314
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,040
 is talking with me, a Samaritan woman?

315
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
 How is it that you are a prophet

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,480
 and you're connecting with me, possibly a social outcast?

317
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,240
 Jesus connected with women.

318
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,360
 He spent time with Mary and Martha and comforted them.

319
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 He allowed this woman to pour perfume onto him

320
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,120
 and wash him with her hair.

321
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,280
 And the Pharisees were like,

322
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,800
 how is it that your teacher allows sinners to come,

323
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 adulterous people to come and touch him and be with him?

324
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,320
 Jesus was counter-cultural.

325
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,200
 Jesus was counter-cultural.

326
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,960
 Jesus forgave tax collectors and sinners.

327
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,640
 He forgave Zacchaeus, right?

328
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,480
 Tax collectors were seen as traitors

329
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,560
 because they worked for Rome,

330
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,280
 but Jesus forgave him and ate with Zacchaeus.

331
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,800
 Today, I'm gonna go to your house.

332
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,640
 Wow, Zacchaeus was shocked.

333
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,280
 All the people surrounded this adulterous woman

334
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,080
 and took up stones and were ready to throw the stone

335
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,960
 in it at her.

336
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,720
 But Jesus said, "If you are without sin,

337
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,560
 "would you cast the first stone?"

338
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,840
 Jesus was counter-cultural

339
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
 because he ate with sinners and tax collectors

340
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,960
 and forgave them.

341
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,960
 He said to the paralyzed man, "Get up and walk."

342
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,640
 Your sins are forgiven.

343
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,840
 That the Pharisees were like, how is it possible?

344
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 This person says that you could forgive sins?

345
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,920
 He could forgive sins?

346
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,200
 Only God can forgive sins.

347
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,080
 And that exists exactly what Jesus said,

348
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,240
 that he is forgiven of his sins

349
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
 in Matthew 9:6.

350
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,320
 He touched, he touched.

351
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
 He touched the untouchable.

352
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,640
 The sinners, the lepers, he touched them.

353
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,760
 He asked the children to come to him.

354
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,560
 When most people were like, push the children aside,

355
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,400
 they're not important.

356
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
 And he taught godly values.

357
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,840
 He told the rich man, "Give away your possessions

358
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,920
 "and follow me."

359
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,400
 He taught that people should take up the cross.

360
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
 When the cross was seen as cruel punishment,

361
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,040
 he said, "Take up the cross.

362
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,320
 "What good is it if you gain the world,

363
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,120
 "but forfeit your soul?

364
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,440
 "That money is the root of all evil,

365
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,440
 "but treasure, true treasure, is found in heaven."

366
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
 He was counter-cultural.

367
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 He was mighty God over his social circumstance.

368
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,040
 Lastly, we see that Jesus was mighty God

369
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,160
 over the spiritual realm.

370
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,280
 How is Jesus mighty God over the spiritual realm?

371
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,040
 You guys can type your answers.

372
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,200
 Anybody know?

373
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,040
 How is Jesus mighty God?

374
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,120
 Yes, resurrection, casted out demons, very good.

375
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,280
 Let's see in the next slide here.

376
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,160
 First, Jesus is mighty over the powers of darkness.

377
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,360
 The man spoke a loud voice and said,

378
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
 "What do you want with me, Jesus,

379
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,080
 "Son of God of the Most High?"

380
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,960
 Even the devil, even the demons acknowledged

381
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,320
 that Jesus is the Son of the Most High.

382
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,400
 Right, amazing, amazing.

383
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,480
 Jesus is mighty over the powers of darkness.

384
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,520
 And lastly, Jesus is mighty over the powers

385
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
 of death and sin.

386
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,840
 Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life.

387
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,840
 "Whoever believes in me will live even though they die.

388
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,360
 "For the wages of sin is death.

389
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 "The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus."

390
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,080
 Jesus is mighty over demons.

391
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
 Jesus is mighty over our sin.

392
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,120
 Jesus is mighty over death.

393
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,280
 He's the one that connects us back to the Father,

394
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,720
 connects us back to God.

395
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,280
 And so we see from this that Jesus, in the next slide,

396
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,840
 that Jesus is mighty God over the physical,

397
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,000
 over the intellectual, over the emotional,

398
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,640
 over the social and the spiritual realm.

399
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,280
 As we look into the next slide,

400
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,960
 I remember when I was hiking one time

401
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,920
 and I was just so amazed.

402
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,560
 I saw this beautiful mountain.

403
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,200
 And at that time, I was so amazed.

404
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,560
 And I was like, "Wow, you are mighty God."

405
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,160
 I looked at the mountains and the clouds

406
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,840
 and it was just, "Wow, God, you spoke."

407
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,640
 And this came to be amazing.

408
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,240
 I remember when Ravi Zacharias came to Calfolk Church

409
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,720
 and he did his event.

410
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,600
 And I was just amazed at how God had empowered this man

411
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,640
 to speak on behalf of him.

412
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,760
 And imagine how smart Ravi Zacharias is.

413
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,280
 How much more intelligent is Jesus?

414
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,280
 He is mighty God over the intelligent, intellectual realm.

415
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,280
 Jesus is mighty God over the social realm, right?

416
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
 Over the emotional realm.

417
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
 I remember I was counseling this student

418
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
 who had broken up with a girlfriend

419
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,880
 and this girlfriend was his idol.

420
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,000
 I know some of you have gone through this.

421
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,320
 He was going through a breakup and he was like,

422
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,800
 "This girl is my idol.

423
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 She's my everything."

424
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,480
 And it got so bad to the point

425
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
 that he wanted to commit suicide

426
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,800
 just to get her attention.

427
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,960
 And I was reminding this student day in, day out,

428
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,520
 trust in God, replace these feelings for this girl

429
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,440
 with your devotion and love for God.

430
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,040
 And it seemed hopeless, right?

431
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,120
 'Cause I was saying the same things over and over again,

432
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,720
 but yet there was no change.

433
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,560
 But after several months,

434
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,880
 he started devoting himself to the word of God.

435
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,560
 God changed him.

436
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,680
 And he's so devoted and passionate.

437
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,880
 A year later, he's so passionate

438
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,920
 towards serving God, reading the word every day,

439
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,680
 serving God, meditating on his word.

440
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,920
 Jesus is mighty over his emotions.

441
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,880
 I saw Jesus as mighty God over his emotions.

442
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,400
 When we worship together as a society at KFC

443
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,400
 and we see each other lifting our praises to the Lord,

444
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 I feel Jesus is mighty over our social circumstances.

445
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:17,040
 And when I see people coming to know Jesus,

446
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,160
 I met a friend recently, his name is Albert,

447
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,160
 and he came to know Jesus just recently,

448
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,840
 growing up from a Catholic background.

449
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,600
 He knew of Jesus, but never placed his life

450
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 in the hands of Jesus as Lord and Savior.

451
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,840
 Just last Thursday, he said,

452
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,680
 "Now I see God's plan in my life,

453
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,320
 "that where he's called me, that he has a plan for me,

454
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,640
 "that he loves me.

455
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,160
 "I see how Jesus has become mighty over his spiritual life."

456
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:59,160
 Now the question is, is Jesus, as we see in the next slide,

457
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,720
 is Jesus mighty God over your life,

458
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,560
 over your physical life, your intellectual, your mind,

459
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,440
 your emotions, your social circumstances?

460
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,360
 Is Jesus mighty over your spiritual circumstances?

461
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,520
 We're going to see in the next slide

462
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,120
 that it's all about trust.

463
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,880
 It's all about trust, as we see in the next slide.

464
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,520
 For the physical, who do you trust?

465
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
 Do you trust God to provide for you,

466
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,200
 or are you trusting in yourself to provide?

467
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,920
 Do you believe that Jesus is mighty God,

468
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,920
 that he will carry you through this hard economic time?

469
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,880
 Do you believe that Jesus is mighty

470
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,400
 over the intellectual realm?

471
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,520
 Do you trust in yourself for knowledge,

472
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,680
 or do you trust him for knowledge,

473
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,720
 for wisdom, for your work, for your school?

474
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,320
 Do you trust that Jesus is mighty God over your emotions,

475
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,560
 your highs, your lows?

476
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,040
 Do you trust Jesus?

477
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:13,000
 Do you let society shape your values and beliefs,

478
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,560
 or is Jesus the first priority?

479
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,360
 Or is Jesus the first priority?

480
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,400
 And for your spiritual realm,

481
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,400
 are you depending on Jesus as mighty to save you?

482
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,360
 You depend on your own works to gain yourself into heaven,

483
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,400
 or do you depend on Jesus?

484
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,440
 And I want to end off with this verse here,

485
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,440
 and it's the angel of the Lord appearing to the shepherds,

486
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,320
 and the angel said, "Do not be afraid, Mary."

487
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,760
 Sorry, I mean Mary, not the shepherds.

488
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,400
 "Mary, for you have found favor with God.

489
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,920
 "You will conceive and give birth to a son.

490
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,760
 "You are to call him Jesus.

491
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,800
 "He will be great,

492
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,040
 "and he will be called the Son of the Most High.

493
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,520
 "The Lord will give him the throne of his father, David,

494
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,280
 "and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.

495
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,720
 "His kingdom will never end."

496
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,200
 Is Jesus mighty God over your life?

497
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,120
 Will you let Jesus reign over your life

498
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,600
 just as he will reign forever and ever?

499
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,760
 We're going to respond in a song,

500
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,800
 and it's called "Mighty to Save."

501
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,000
 Maybe you've come unto our worship for the first time.

502
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,520
 Maybe you've come many times,

503
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,000
 but you've never made this point to ask Jesus

504
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,560
 to be the mighty Savior, mighty God over your life.

505
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,480
 You can do that now.

506
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,840
 You can ask Jesus to be the Lord and Savior of your life.

507
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,040
 If you would like to do that, you can pray with me.

508
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,440
 I'm going to say a prayer,

509
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,240
 and you can repeat after me

510
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,640
 to ask Jesus to be mighty Savior over your life.

511
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,560
 Let's all pray together.

512
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,560
 "Dear Jesus, I thank you for dying on the cross.

513
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,680
 "I thank you for coming on earth

514
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,840
 "to be the ultimate sacrifice.

515
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,000
 "I want to confess that I need a Savior.

516
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,960
 "I cannot save myself.

517
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,680
 "I am a sinner.

518
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,160
 "Jesus, come into my heart.

519
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,880
 "Be the Lord and Savior of my life.

520
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,240
 "Make me the person that you want me to be.

521
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,240
 "In Jesus' name I pray, amen."

522
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,400
 If you prayed that prayer,

523
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,840
 Jesus now lives in you and reigns in your life,

524
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,600
 and he is your mighty God.

525
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,440
 God bless you.

526
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:23,440
