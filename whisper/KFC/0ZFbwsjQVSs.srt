1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 >> Thank you very much.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 I feel quite overwhelmed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,920
 This will be my last KFCI Saturday afternoon sermon.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,680
 Not my last sermon, I assure you.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,960
 But nonetheless, it holds a very special significance for Sandra and I.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,240
 And I'm so glad that it comes in this Seeing the Heart of Jesus series.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:44,520
 When we first decided on this series, I had no idea it would be my last in this role.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:53,720
 It was meant just as a genuine follow-up from our Serving the Community series.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,160
 But for me, things move fast in Hong Kong.

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 I've been so grateful for all six of our speakers in this series, and feel doubly honored to

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,160
 bring this week's talk on A Heart That Forgives.

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:21,440
 As we look at Jesus and the woman caught in adultery.

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,560
 I am so excited, James.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,960
 I'm so excited for the new English service and the new location.

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:39,120
 I love you all to get 100% behind Pastor James, Christina, and the team.

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:48,600
 One promise, Sandra and I will be your biggest cheerleaders.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,400
 This week I've really wrestled, I've toiled.

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:00,120
 I've grasped to find something I wanted to leave you with.

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:08,320
 Something that would hopefully carry you through the rest of your lives and indeed into eternity.

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:16,080
 Something you might look back on and say, "Yeah, Pastor John taught us this."

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,720
 I got my answer in the unlikely shape of a new song.

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,680
 No, I'm not going to sing.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,120
 Done that.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,200
 Just a few weeks ago I came across a brand new song by Phil Wickham.

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,800
 We sing a lot of Phil Wickham songs here.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,480
 This is Amazing Grace, Living Hope, Hymn of Heaven, etc.

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:51,040
 It's called The Jesus Way, and it reflects so much of what we have been hearing here

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,320
 week after week during this Seeing the Heart of Jesus series.

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,860
 Phil Wickham could have written it for this series and especially tonight's sermon.

30
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,960
 Just look at some of the words.

31
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,360
 I've put them on the screen.

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,960
 If you curse me, then I will bless you.

33
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,520
 If you hurt me, I will forgive.

34
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,880
 If you hate me, then I will love you.

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,980
 I choose the Jesus way.

36
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,640
 If you're helpless, I will defend you.

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,360
 If you're burdened, I'll share the weight.

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,560
 If you're hopeless, then let me show you.

39
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,400
 There's hope in the Jesus way.

40
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
 I follow Jesus.

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,780
 I follow Jesus.

42
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,800
 He wore my sin.

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,200
 I gladly bear his name.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
 I love that line.

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,760
 He is the treasure.

46
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
 He is the answer.

47
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,080
 Oh, I choose the Jesus way.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,280
 The Jesus way.

49
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:18,340
 My prayer is that when we look back on these past seven years, we would all say the one

50
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:26,280
 thing that we learned together was to do things the Jesus way.

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,920
 But we were not unduly influenced by church culture, prevailing trends in the church,

52
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,940
 or by how people expected us to be.

53
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,520
 But we tried our very best, and not always succeeding, of course.

54
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,840
 But we tried our very best to be the hands and feet of the Lord Jesus and demonstrated

55
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,020
 His heart in all we've done.

56
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:03,880
 So before tonight's passage, I want you to watch the lyric video.

57
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:13,100
 And as you watch it, open your heart to the words that you're about to hear.

58
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:24,800
 And as you hear them, I pray that you will resolve to follow Jesus in faith and obedience

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,040
 and choose the Jesus way.

60
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
 Let's watch the video.

61
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
 If you curse me, then I will bless you.

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 If you hurt me, then I will heal you.

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
 If you love me, then I will bless you.

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040

145
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,040

146
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,040

160
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,040

 If you love me, then I will bless you.

164
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,040
 If you love me, then I will bless you.

165
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:57,040
 Does this event seem to be consistent with the heart and attitude of Jesus as he is portrayed through the gospel?

166
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
 And my answer is a resounding yes.

167
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,040
 It is an embodiment.

168
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 It is a powerful expression of the Jesus way.

169
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:16,040
 And yet it starts off with a fishing story.

170
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 What? You say what?

171
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 Now, me and fishing do not get on.

172
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 I've got to tell you this.

173
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,040
 I do not have sea legs. I get seasick on the Star Ferry.

174
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:39,040
 On the other hand, my son Matt, who lives in Saicong, tries to get out and go fishing every morning.

175
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,040
 But it wasn't his dad that taught him.

176
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
 It was his mom.

177
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,040
 But what I do know about fishing is this.

178
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,040
 Bait is an important part of fishing.

179
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,040
 Now, why am I saying this?

180
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,040
 My friends, this woman was bait.

181
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 Fish bait.

182
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:19,040
 The teachers and the Pharisees wanted to trap Jesus and were willing to see this woman put to death in order to get to him.

183
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
 Let's read it.

184
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,040
 At dawn, he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.

185
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,040
 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.

186
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:44,040
 They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery."

187
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,040
 In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.

188
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,040
 Now, what do you say?

189
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:03,040
 They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.

190
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
 The trap is set.

191
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,040
 The setting is, it is early morning.

192
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,040
 We read in verse 2, "At dawn, and Jesus has come into the temple to teach."

193
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:26,040
 We read a crowd gathered as one might have expected, given the news of Jesus' teaching had spread widely.

194
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,040
 This is one of the reasons the authorities were after him.

195
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:39,040
 And we can imagine the scene of the crowd intently listening to Jesus,

196
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,040
 when all of a sudden, there was a kerfuffle.

197
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
 I like that word. I've never used that in a sermon before. I'll use it again.

198
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,040
 There was a kerfuffle at the back of the room.

199
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:01,040
 Imagine the scene of the crowd intently listening to Jesus.

200
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:17,040
 Slowly, the crowd parts, and a woman being dragged forward by the officially robed scribes and Pharisees is thrust before Jesus.

201
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:31,040
 Imagine the scene. Them in their robes, and her clothes all over the place, and looking a real mess.

202
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,040
 Why? Because she had just been caught in adultery.

203
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:48,040
 Dragged from her bed, she became fish bait. The objective, to trap Jesus.

204
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 "Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery."

205
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,040
 "In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women."

206
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,040
 "Now what do you say?"

207
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,040
 "This woman had committed a capital offence."

208
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:19,040
 "And it's important to note that neither Jesus, nor the woman refutes, denies the charge against her."

209
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,040
 "She is guilty."

210
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,040
 Full stop.

211
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:36,040
 "And the law states, the penalty is death by stoning."

212
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:44,040
 You can see, can't you, that Jesus is faced with the ultimate dilemma.

213
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 Here is the dilemma. How does God balance his justice and his mercy?

214
00:18:50,040 --> 00:19:02,040
 If God is a God of righteousness, and a God of justice, and a God of judgment by his holy nature, she must die.

215
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:14,040
 If God is a God of love, and a God of grace, and a God of kindness, and mercy, and forgiveness, she must live.

216
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 How can he be a God of justice, and forgive sin?

217
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,040
 How can he be a God of love, and punish sin?

218
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:35,040
 A dilemma is when you have two options, and no matter what you select, you're in trouble.

219
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:43,040
 Option one, show mercy and compassion to this woman, and demand she be set free.

220
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:52,040
 But if he does so, he will be seen as defying the law of Moses, and risk discrediting his teaching and ministry.

221
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:59,040
 Option two, order her execution by stoning, and affirm his allegiance to Moses' law.

222
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,040
 But actually, only the Roman government was allowed to execute capital punishment.

223
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:17,040
 And if Jesus orders the woman's death, he is in violation to Rome, and could potentially be handed over to the authorities, and even executed himself.

224
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,040
 Either way, he's in trouble.

225
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,040
 Either with Israel, or with Rome. It's like tossing a coin.

226
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,040
 Heads he loses, tails he loses.

227
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,040
 But let's look at the real truth here.

228
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:42,040
 The context. And for that, we need to go back to the previous chapter, the night before this event.

229
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
 I want to read this to you.

230
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:53,040
 "Finally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked him, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'

231
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,040
 'No one ever spoke the way this man does,' the guards replied.

232
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,040
 'You mean, as he deceived you also?' the Pharisees retorted.

233
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,040
 'Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?'

234
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:12,040
 'No, but this mob that knows nothing of the law, there is a curse on them.'"

235
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,040
 The scene here. They were meeting in secret.

236
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:22,040
 "They had ordered the temple police to arrest Jesus and bring him to them.

237
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,040
 But instead, the guards were mesmerized by Jesus' teaching.

238
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,040
 They said, 'No one's ever spoken the way this man does.'

239
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,040
 That was their reply to the question, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'

240
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,040
 Hence, the trap.

241
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,040
 And they conveniently manipulate the law to trap Jesus.

242
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,040
 Look at this. Deuteronomy 22.

243
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,040
 "If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife,

244
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:11,040
 both the man who slept with her and the woman must die."

245
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 You must purge evil from Israel.

246
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:27,040
 Verse 24. "You shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death."

247
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:34,040
 Now the obvious question here is, where is the man?

248
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 They were going to uphold the law, right?

249
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 But where was the man? He was supposed to be punished.

250
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,040
 They're not interested in upholding the law.

251
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 They're only interested in trapping Jesus.

252
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,040
 Apparently, the religious leaders were not only willing to let this woman be stoned to death

253
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 in order to attract Jesus.

254
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,040
 They were also willing to let some unidentified, unattested Jewish man

255
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:14,040
 to commit the sin of adultery so that they would have some bait in the trap they were setting for Jesus.

256
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,040
 Their aim was simple. Destroy Jesus.

257
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 And they were happy to have a man's adultery ignored

258
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,040
 and a woman killed to accomplish their goals.

259
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:38,040
 How would Jesus react at this blatant attempt to manipulate justice?

260
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,040
 What would be the Jesus way?

261
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
 Look at this. This is brilliant.

262
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:55,040
 "But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger."

263
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,040
 Just imagine the scene. I wish I'd been there.

264
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,040
 The crowd are holding their breath.

265
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,040
 They're waiting for Jesus' response.

266
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,040
 But he doesn't speak to the woman. He doesn't speak to the accusers.

267
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:18,040
 Instead, he stoops down and writes in the dirt at his feet.

268
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,040
 Now, the great question that scholars have wrestled with over the years is

269
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,040
 what exactly did Jesus write in the sand?

270
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,040
 Some believe he was writing the Pharisees' names and possibly their sins.

271
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,040
 This theory is based primarily on Jeremiah 17.13.

272
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,040
 "Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth

273
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,040
 because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters."

274
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,040
 In the preceding chapter of John, Jesus spoke of himself as living water.

275
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,040
 So perhaps he was fulfilling a prophecy.

276
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,040
 Others believe it was to demonstrate, as God the Father did

277
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,040
 when he carved the Ten Commandments in stone with his finger,

278
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,040
 that Jesus had the authority to issue two new commandments

279
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,040
 for us to love God and love one another.

280
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 We don't know for sure what Jesus was writing.

281
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,040
 Nor do we know who saw his message.

282
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,040
 I'd like to think that once the crowd had dispersed

283
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
 and he was left to deal with the woman himself,

284
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,040
 he'd have written only one other word, "forgiven."

285
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 But who knows?

286
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:38,040
 So then, after writing in the dirt, what is his response?

287
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
 Let's read his response.

288
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,040
 Verse 7, "When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,

289
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:53,040
 'Let any one of you who was without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.'

290
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,040
 Again he stooped down and wrote in the ground.

291
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,040
 At this, those who heard began to go away, one at a time,

292
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,040
 the elder ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there."

293
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 Friends, this is the game changer.

294
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,040
 We read, "The leaders kept on questioning him."

295
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,040
 They wouldn't let up.

296
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 In my mind, they keep on hammering the question.

297
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
 What do you say we do with this adulterous woman?

298
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,040
 Do we stone her? What do you say?

299
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,040
 Maybe they were throwing out more challenges and taunts.

300
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,040
 Answer us, prophet.

301
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,040
 What does your father have to say, son of God?

302
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,040
 Mobs have a tendency to get louder and more aggressive.

303
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,040
 Maybe there was some pushing and shoving.

304
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:55,040
 There is no other way to describe this except as an ugly scene.

305
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,040
 But before they know what happens,

306
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:08,040
 the Bible tells us that Jesus straightens up and takes control of the situation.

307
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,040
 He changes the rules of the game in 18 words,

308
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 maybe in less than 10 seconds.

309
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:26,040
 Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.

310
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:36,040
 Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.

311
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,040
 Suddenly the issue is not about Jesus' credibility or the woman's guilt.

312
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:53,040
 Jesus turns the table by making the issue about who is and who is not qualified to judge another human being.

313
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,040
 The issue is not the standard.

314
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:10,040
 The benchmark has moved from one not committing the sin of adultery to one who is without sin.

315
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:19,040
 Which, by the way, is why God alone is qualified to judge sins in human beings.

316
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 By the way, some of us would do well to remember that.

317
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,040
 What Jesus is saying is this.

318
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
 This is God's business, not yours.

319
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,040
 You don't even have a right to bring up the issue.

320
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:42,040
 And so the charade of religious righteousness has been exposed

321
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,040
 because they know they can't claim utter sinlessness.

322
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:55,040
 These men who are happy to destroy, entrap, and judge others sink away in embarrassment,

323
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:05,040
 dropping their stones, ready to plot other ways to destroy Jesus.

324
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,040
 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time.

325
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:19,040
 The older ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.

326
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,040
 Only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.

327
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:33,040
 Now let's look at how Jesus completes the rescue.

328
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:42,040
 Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"

329
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:49,040
 "No one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared.

330
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,040
 "Go now and leave your life of sin."

331
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,040
 Now put yourself in the woman's place.

332
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,040
 She's been caught with her hands in the proverbial cookie jar.

333
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 She has been publicly charged and is genuinely guilty.

334
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,040
 And now she has a one-on-one with Jesus.

335
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,040
 But how will he respond to her?

336
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,040
 He basically says to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours?"

337
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:28,040
 "No one has condemned you. If no one wants to prosecute, the trial is over."

338
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,040
 And my friends, three things.

339
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:39,040
 Condemnation, correction, and compassion are the issues here.

340
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,040
 Firstly, the Jesus way is not condemnation.

341
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,040
 He says, "Then neither do I condemn you."

342
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:54,040
 But note the Jesus way is correction.

343
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
 "Go now and leave your life of sin."

344
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,040
 This is important and should not be ignored.

345
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:10,040
 But above all, the Jesus way is compassion.

346
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:17,040
 For the first time in probably a long time, someone views her as a person, not a thing.

347
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,040
 For the first time in probably a long time, someone interacts with her

348
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,040
 with a real concern for her well-being and not for his selfish ends.

349
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,040
 For the first time in probably a long time, she feels the warmth of compassion,

350
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,040
 albeit with strict words of discipline and correction,

351
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,040
 and remembers what it feels like to be a human being.

352
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,040
 I think she was going to live out the rest of her life doing what she could

353
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:51,040
 to please Jesus because of the gratitude that she had in her heart.

354
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,040
 In conclusion, the two most popular words in any sermon.

355
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:08,040
 In conclusion, if I had to sum up the Jesus way in one word,

356
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,040
 I'd use grace.

357
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,040
 I'd use grace.

358
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:25,040
 I hope, I pray, when we look back on these past seven years of Saturday afternoons,

359
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:36,040
 that what we would have experienced at the center of this service

360
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,040
 is exactly that, grace.

361
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:47,040
 Jesus' interaction with this woman, she was more accustomed to being used than being loved,

362
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:55,040
 is a powerful reminder that our lives, both past and present,

363
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,040
 I love this, I'll put it on the screen,

364
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:10,040
 the product of our past needs to be resolved in our present to secure our future.

365
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,040
 Screenshot that, well done.

366
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:22,040
 The product of our past needs to be resolved in our present to secure our future.

367
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:28,040
 And the key behind that resolution is the grace of our Lord.

368
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,040
 He deals directly with her problems and then directs her towards a future

369
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:41,040
 that is pointed towards life and away from the self-destructed habits of the past.

370
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,040
 Grace is the heart of God that loves people.

371
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:58,040
 And nowhere is grace seen so clearly than in the life of this someone who knows undeservedness.

372
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:07,040
 I wonder if we are grateful for what Jesus has done for us.

373
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 I want to call you, I want to call the church, the one church.

374
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,040
 Many of us have grown up in churches where it seems the law of Moses

375
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,040
 seems more important than the grace of Jesus.

376
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 Rules, rules, rules, rules, rules.

377
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:38,040
 I remember meeting with two pastors after a tragic high-profile suicide

378
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,040
 and asking the question, "Was she a Christian?"

379
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,040
 I was given the answer, "She was a lesbian."

380
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,040
 That response absolutely broke my heart.

381
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:03,040
 My friends, choose the Jesus way.

382
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,040
 See the heart of Jesus and use it as your compass.

383
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,040
 If you are here tonight and you are not following Jesus,

384
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:25,040
 I want to say to you, I'm sorry for the Jesus that we as Christians at times have shown you.

385
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,040
 The headmaster wanting to punish your mistakes.

386
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:38,040
 I invite you to be like this woman and run into his arms.

387
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:45,040
 Experience his love, his forgiveness and grace.

388
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:53,040
 To surrender your life to him right here, right now.

389
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:02,040
 As I ask the band to return, please Paul.

390
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:10,040
 I leave my final words to Phil Wickham.

391
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 This is what he says in that song.

392
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:21,040
 "And I choose surrender. I choose to love.

393
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,040
 Oh God my Savior, you'll always be enough.

394
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,040
 I choose forgiveness. I choose grace.

395
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:41,040
 I choose to worship no matter what I face.

396
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:54,040
 I choose the Jesus way." Let's stand.

397
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,040
 I'd love to pray for you.

398
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,040
 I just wonder if you just stretch your hands in front of you.

399
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,040
 It's not a religious thing. Sometimes we do in church to say,

400
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,040
 "I'm open to receive what God has for me."

401
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,040
 And if there's anyone here who hasn't received Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior,

402
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,040
 I want to give you an opportunity right here and now

403
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:25,040
 to choose forgiveness, to choose grace.

404
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,040
 We can look at this woman, but we've all done things wrong.

405
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:40,040
 But she was able to run into the arms of Jesus.

406
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,040
 If you just say this prayer in your heart, "Lord Jesus,

407
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,040
 I come to you now for forgiveness. I receive your grace.

408
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,040
 I'm a sinner in need of forgiveness. I choose grace.

409
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:10,040
 I receive your love for me. Forgive my sins and come into my life right now."

410
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,040
 And if you've prayed that prayer, please tell someone before you leave tonight

411
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,040
 and get them to pray for you.

412
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:25,040
 And for the rest of us, I'm just going to pray now for the Holy Spirit just to come

413
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,040
 to fill us afresh.

414
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,040
 We know choosing the Jesus way is not easy.

415
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,040
 We can't do it on our own.

416
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,040
 We need each other.

417
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,040
 But we need, Lord, the power of your Spirit.

418
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:59,040
 As we sing this song together, Lord, I pray that you will show us.

419
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,040
 Show us the way forward so that we can say as a church,

420
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:14,040
 so that we can say as a church in this city, we chose the Jesus way.

421
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
 Let's worship God.

422
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:26,040
