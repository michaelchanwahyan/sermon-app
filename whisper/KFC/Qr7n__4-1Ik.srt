1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
 Good evening everyone, good to see you all.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,680
 Hello everyone online, we miss you, we hope you're well and I hope to see you soon.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,920
 We started this series on the church together and I absolutely love this series.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,880
 So much has happened in Hong Kong in these last few years, right?

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,040
 And I truly believe the Lord is doing something to the church.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,720
 A lot of it is pruning, a lot of it is purging, but something's happening.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,200
 And the church, we have to change, we have to evolve in the way that we're doing church.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,780
 We have to think about how are the times changing and how do we reach people with the gospel.

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,100
 But then there's also these things that we really shouldn't change.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,860
 These things that should remain pillars of what it means to be church, to mean to be

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,960
 the ecclesia, which is a gathering of believers, an assembly of believers.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,360
 And John last week gave us this picture of a chair with four legs.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,320
 And these believers, they relied on these four legs.

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
 What were they?

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,640
 The apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, prayers.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,940
 And we're going to go through each one today.

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,880
 And the one we're going to go through is, the title I've been given for this is, it's

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,860
 the apostles' teaching, it is a word-rooted church.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,180
 I'm talking about the first one, which is the apostles' teaching.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,440
 We're talking about the Bible.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,320
 And I'll be honest with you, I've had a really heavy heart preparing this.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
 I'm actually very confused.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,960
 I was like, how do I give a sermon about the Bible?

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
 How do I convince you?

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
 How do I encourage all of us?

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,320
 How do I inspire all of us to read the Bible?

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,160
 And then I thought, you know what?

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,040
 Jesus loves me, this I know for the Bible tells me so.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,360
 And maybe I'll find a clever acronym to help people remember, B-I-B-L-E.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
 Maybe that's the one.

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,600
 Maybe I'll try and think of a way to help you remember to read the Bible.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 How many of us read the Bible every day?

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,960
 Be proud, be proud, praise God.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,520
 But yet it's so hard, right?

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,160
 Even those of us who read it every day, we realize it's a hard thing to do.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,680
 So then I was on this side thinking, I couldn't think of an acronym, a clever one at least,

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
 to kind of help you remember.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,600
 Then I saw on the other way, I'm like, you know what?

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,320
 Who am I to convince you about this word?

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,320
 This book is why we're here.

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,840
 Everything in this book is the reason that we need, everything is here.

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,400
 Why do I even need to say anything?

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
 I should just spend the next half an hour reading from the Bible.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,360
 Because we're a word-rooted church, right?

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,480
 And you'll be pleased to know I'm not doing that, that would be lazy.

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,760
 You didn't pay to, actually you didn't pay to come here at all.

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,720
 But anyway, you didn't come to just see me read the Bible.

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
 Later, in the second half, I will.

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,280
 Because I feel that that's still the best way for us to be convinced about what this

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,520
 word is really about.

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,160
 But before that, I want to preface it, I want to give us a little bit of an introduction

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,760
 as to why this is important.

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,120
 Why did the early believers devote, devote, of one mind, focus on the apostles' teaching?

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 What was it about?

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
 When did they do it?

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
 How did they do it?

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
 And why did they do it?

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,760
 So I'll spend the first half really talking about that, helping us understand a little

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,520
 bit about this, and then we will read, we will receive the word of the Lord together.

60
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 Is that good?

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,040
 Okay, so, what is it?

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,520
 It's the apostles' teaching.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,160
 The apostles' teaching is the Bible.

64
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
 What is that?

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,040
 I think the best example of this is in Acts 2, where Jesus, in Acts chapter 1, flies off

66
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,160
 to heaven and he says, "I'll be back."

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,520
 And then chapter 2, the Holy Spirit comes.

68
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,520
 The Holy Spirit comes and then Peter, obnoxious, arrogant Peter, impulsive Peter, suddenly

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,640
 is filled with the Spirit and he stands up.

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,880
 And he stands up and he delivers a speech.

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
 He delivers the speech for the ages.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,520
 It's called a kerygma.

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 What is this kerygma?

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
 You'll see in Acts 2.

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,680
 It's not short, but it's basically his first attempt at proclaiming the gospel.

76
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,620
 The kerygma is basically a proclamation of the gospel.

77
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,520
 It's about the life and the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,360
 That would be called the apostles' teaching.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,400
 The apostle Peter, teaching.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,480
 But what was he doing in that kerygma?

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,840
 He was opening up the Word.

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,660
 What was he reading in the Word?

83
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,320
 He was reading the Old Testament.

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,520
 Remember, when Peter was preaching, he wasn't preaching from the book of Acts.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
 He was the book of Acts.

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,800
 The book of Acts is basically the book of the Acts of the apostles.

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,280
 That's what it's about.

88
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,000
 So he's looking at the Old Testament.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Now the Old Testament is hard.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,020
 I'll confess, the Old Testament is hard to understand.

91
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,240
 It's hard to read sometimes.

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,540
 And yet he was opening the Old Testament.

93
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,880
 He was looking at the book of Joel.

94
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,720
 He was looking at Psalms and he was saying, "Guys, this Old Testament that we've read

95
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,320
 all of our lives, you know what it's about?

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,280
 It's about Jesus.

97
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,200
 Everything that is prophesied in the Old Testament is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,880
 All the problems of mankind that we see in the Old Testament, and there are plenty, even

99
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,680
 from the best ones, the solution is in Jesus.

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,840
 So he, when he was opening the book, he was looking at the Old Testament and he was saying,

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,760
 "Guys, this here is truth."

102
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,160
 And it wasn't just the Old Testament.

103
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,780
 Actually in the early church, especially in the first few centuries, they were also reading

104
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,120
 letters to each other.

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,320
 The letters that Paul was writing to the churches, the letters that Peter was writing, the letters

106
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
 that James was writing.

107
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,880
 At the beginning of James it says, "To the twelve tribes in the dispersion," they were

108
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,040
 writing letters, these epistles, writing them to the church, a gathering just like this.

109
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,840
 And what would the person do when they gather?

110
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,280
 They would open up the letter or they would take open the letter and they would read it

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
 out to people.

112
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,640
 That would be what they would do.

113
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 That's what it meant when it said they would be devoted to the apostles' teaching.

114
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,120
 It was opening up the word.

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,400
 That is really it and that is what it is.

116
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,120
 So when would they like to read it?

117
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
 When?

118
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
 All the time.

119
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,000
 You have to remember something.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,280
 In the Greco-Roman culture at that time, reading was a very important part of culture.

121
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,480
 If you went to a dinner party, if you went to someone's home to have dinner at their

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,640
 place, you would eat and then what would happen?

123
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,120
 Towards the end of the evening, the host likely would stand up and they would give a reading.

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,600
 Those of us who have come from maybe more traditional schools will be very used to this.

125
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,440
 Reading was a big part of culture back then and they wouldn't read the Bible necessarily

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,760
 if they weren't followers of Christ.

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,600
 They would read Plato's writings, they would read Homer's writings, but they would read.

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,480
 And then Paul was telling the believers here, "Read Scripture."

129
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,880
 In 1 Timothy 4, he's talking to his mentee, Timothy, who was probably around the same

130
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
 age as I am now, leading his own church in Ephesus, and he was saying in 1 Timothy 4,

131
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,160
 "Devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture."

132
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,760
 It's important.

133
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
 Devote yourself to it.

134
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,400
 Do it all the time.

135
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 Colossians 3.16 says, "May the message of Christ dwell among you richly.

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,160
 May it surround you."

137
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,800
 So it was something that was done all the time.

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
 Why?

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
 Because they had this incredibly high regard for Scripture.

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,680
 Did you know that it would be considered a serious offence if someone came here and opened

141
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,000
 up the book in the early church and read, but misread some Scripture?

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 It would be hugely offensive.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Why?

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,220
 Because that was the truth of God.

145
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,340
 The other reason why is most people couldn't read at that time.

146
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,620
 Most people didn't have a Bible.

147
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,200
 And so what was read from the pulpit, what was read in the gathering, was of huge importance

148
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,240
 because what was being read and what was being listened to, that would be it.

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
 People didn't have smartphones.

150
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
 People didn't have WhatsApp.

151
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,680
 People didn't have, "Oh, I'll send you this article later."

152
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
 None.

153
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,160
 It's basically, "We're all sitting here now and we're all reading and we're receiving

154
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,280
 the truth together."

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,120
 And this was important because imagine this church here.

156
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,860
 We were an early church gathering.

157
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,700
 Outside there would be persecution happening.

158
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,180
 We'd have probably had to jump through quite a few hoops, been quite subtle, to get into

159
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,220
 this place to even gather, to make sure that the authorities outside wouldn't be chasing

160
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,220
 us.

161
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,600
 And within the church there was also division.

162
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,080
 People were arguing about truth.

163
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
 People were going, "No, that's not right.

164
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
 That's not right."

165
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
 There was Gnosticism happening.

166
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,320
 There was false heresy happening.

167
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,080
 So even within a room like this, there'd be people who were arguing over the truth, which

168
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,780
 is why the first song we sang, the Creed, that's where it came from.

169
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
 People were like, "You know what?

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
 There's been so much arguing.

171
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
 There's been so much discussion.

172
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,680
 Let us just write down the things that we actually believe so there is no debate."

173
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,080
 And so you can see how important it was for people to be devoted to this book, to listening

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,400
 to it, because without it, they would lose their sense of center.

175
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,960
 Do you get that?

176
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,820
 It provided them with the historical context of what actually happened.

177
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,360
 They didn't have Wikipedia, so it would be from listening that they would find out, they

178
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
 would remember what actually happened.

179
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,040
 It would give them their doctrinal center where they actually knew what they believed.

180
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,800
 They were devoted to this communal immersion of Scripture.

181
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,520
 But we've gone very far away from that now, haven't we?

182
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,680
 I mean, actually, I really treasure the times that we read Scripture here in church, but

183
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,840
 on the most part, we read the Bible on our own, right?

184
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,440
 We've transitioned away from the communal immersion of Scripture, and we've gone to

185
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
 read on our own.

186
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,240
 And sometimes, instead of reading the Bible, what do we read?

187
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,720
 We read devotionals that help us understand the Bible.

188
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,400
 We read books to help to talk about the Bible, right?

189
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,640
 And has that actually worked?

190
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,700
 Research shows that not really.

191
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,840
 We don't know the word anymore.

192
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,600
 But yet, this is the most important part.

193
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,800
 John gave us this example of this four-legged chair, and I think it's right, these four

194
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
 pillars of the church.

195
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,400
 I've got another analogy here, which is like a three-legged stool.

196
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,920
 A three-legged stool, and there would be fellowship, there would be breaking of bread, and there

197
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,200
 would be prayers, and the word would be that.

198
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
 Do you know that in those three-legged stools, there'd be that kind of round bar that holds

199
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
 those three legs together?

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
 I see that's what the Word of God is.

201
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,720
 That it's based on the Word of God that you can have fellowship, that you can have breaking

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,600
 of bread and worship, that you can have prayers.

203
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,800
 It's based on truth, because without this, we have nothing.

204
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,480
 That is how important it is, yet we have strayed so far, so far from it.

205
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,800
 And the consequences are pretty dire.

206
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,880
 They're pretty serious, both in a private and a public sense of expressing faith.

207
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,360
 Privately, we no longer really know how we fit into the big story.

208
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
 Why?

209
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,480
 Because when we open Scripture, we snack.

210
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,720
 Now, it's okay at the very beginning, but later on, you have to start feeding yourself.

211
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
 You have to start understanding the bigger story.

212
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,400
 What it has done, by us stopping to read Scripture together as a whole, we are now completely

213
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,940
 unfamiliar with the big story.

214
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,040
 We snack.

215
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,080
 We look at Jeremiah 29, and we write it on a fridge magnet, and we go, "Oh, for I know

216
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,760
 the plans He has for me, to prosper me, and it's going to be all nice and happy for me."

217
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,640
 We look at Joshua 1.9, "Be strong and courageous, for the Lord your God is with you."

218
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,720
 I have a lion next to me.

219
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,120
 I can be strong and courageous.

220
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,520
 Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd.

221
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,200
 I can lie and just chill by a lake, by still waters, and it's all good for me."

222
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,960
 John 3.16, "God so loved me that He gave His only Son."

223
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,840
 Romans 8, "If God can be for me, who can be against me?

224
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,960
 Nothing can separate me from the love of God."

225
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,480
 And there, so we snack.

226
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,400
 We take all these things, and we're like, "Oh, it's all about us.

227
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 It's all about us.

228
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 It's all about us."

229
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,280
 We're snacking, all the while recognizing that we have missed the feast that is this

230
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,200
 whole story.

231
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,720
 And I apologize to you as a shepherd of the flock, as a pastor here.

232
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,000
 I don't think we give this enough justice.

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
 I rely on my acronyms.

234
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
 I rely on my jokes.

235
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,000
 I rely on my stories to help you remember this word, when all I actually really should

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,980
 be doing is showing you this, because this is enough.

237
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,320
 And so what does it mean to be a word-rooted church?

238
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,920
 Is that, do we have the sustained discipline and attention to go through the Word of God,

239
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,520
 recognizing how valuable it is to us, and allowing this to speak for itself?

240
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:21,760
 And yet so often for church, and us pastors fall guilty of this, we try to entertain you.

241
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,680
 Are you not entertained by our singing and dancing and acronyms?

242
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,440
 I'm a big basketball fan, as you know, and I've been watching the NBA playoffs.

243
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,680
 And I don't know who else has been watching the NBA playoffs.

244
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,000
 If you watch a whole game, you are subject to the most incredible entertainment show.

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,360
 I don't know if you watch it, there's timeouts, and there's the world's jump rope skipping

246
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,120
 champion is in the timeout, who's showing you how they can do that.

247
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,320
 And then over here, it's like, oh, the champion of the chin balancing competition, I didn't

248
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,800
 realize, and he balanced the table on his chin.

249
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,480
 And the whole thing, I was like, wow, this entertainment is incredible.

250
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
 It's nonstop.

251
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,280
 You just sit here, just being fed and fed and fed and fed.

252
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,800
 And it's every few seconds, something's happening.

253
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,680
 And I realized, man, are we guilty of that for church?

254
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,160
 That we've trained all of us to just be fed all this stuff and these snacks and these

255
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,640
 sound bites.

256
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,640
 But truth is, when it comes to scripture, there is no shortcut.

257
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,600
 John asked this question just before this, and he said, is Jesus the center?

258
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,880
 I had another question for myself.

259
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:40,400
 If suddenly all the Bibles in this church vanished, would we still be able to do church?

260
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,720
 I asked myself that question.

261
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,000
 And you know what the terrifying thing is?

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,840
 I was like, I think we could put on a few great songs, open the doors, have someone

263
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,200
 come out and give some nice self-help kind of advice.

264
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,240
 Like, feel good about yourself, you guys are all loved and treasured.

265
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,480
 I think we could probably get away with running church for quite a long time without the Bible

266
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
 at all.

267
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,000
 And that terrifies me, because that's not what we're about.

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,720
 And then I posed that question to myself.

269
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,800
 James, if tomorrow you wake up and this Bible, someone stole your Bible, would you be able

270
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 to still live?

271
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,920
 Would it change your life at all?

272
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,480
 So I asked you that question.

273
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,080
 If suddenly the Bible app was deleted from your phone and you lost your Bible, would

274
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,040
 it change your life at all?

275
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,640
 Be honest, you don't need to tell me, just be honest.

276
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,720
 Sometimes I fear it won't change.

277
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,440
 If anything, the only thing that will change is that we'll feel less guilty about not reading

278
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
 the Bible.

279
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,280
 Oh, we don't have the Bible anyway, so we don't have to read it.

280
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,480
 But if this is really what it is saying it is, Jesus says in Matthew 4,4, "Man shall

281
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,800
 not live on bread alone, but by the words that come out of the mouth of God."

282
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,240
 He's saying that the Bible is more important than carbs, more important than bread, more

283
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,400
 important than fries and spaghetti and pasta.

284
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
 But do we treat it as such?

285
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,040
 We eat carbs every day, we eat bread every day, but do we read the Bible every day?

286
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,320
 So that's what it is, that's when it was read and how it was read, but why was it important?

287
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,280
 Well, I don't know how much more I can tell, but this is the Word of God.

288
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,560
 2 Timothy 3 says, "All Scripture is," what?

289
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,880
 "breathed out by God."

290
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,620
 Just pause for a second.

291
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:37,720
 This book, even Leviticus, is breathed out by God Almighty Himself.

292
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,640
 You know, there's stories around the world where people don't have access to this and

293
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,200
 they are just yearning for it.

294
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,040
 You know, actually the Jewish culture, they were so used to this communal immersion that

295
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,440
 many communities from a very young age, from when children are six, they would start memorizing

296
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
 the Torah.

297
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
 Do we know what the Torah is?

298
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,240
 The Torah is the first five books of the Bible.

299
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,920
 So from six, if you see my daughter running around, she's five years old.

300
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,600
 So next year, she's going to the synagogue and she's memorizing the Torah.

301
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,600
 How many of us even know which order the first five books go in?

302
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 And by the age of ten.

303
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,640
 So Reuben's nine, my older one is nine.

304
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,280
 So next year, when he's ten, he will have memorized the whole Torah.

305
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,240
 The whole thing.

306
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
 And yet we've come so far from it.

307
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,080
 This is the Word of God, how valuable it is.

308
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,520
 In England, in our family home, there's a drawer and it's still there.

309
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,960
 There's this old Philips mobile phone.

310
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,880
 We bought it in 2002.

311
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,680
 All other phones, the Nokia 3210s, they're all gone.

312
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,160
 We've passed them on or thrown them or something.

313
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,240
 But this one phone that we keep.

314
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,760
 The screen is about this big.

315
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,280
 It's blue, it's navy blue.

316
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,600
 It's about this big, a little antenna that comes out and then just the keypad.

317
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,880
 We've kept that phone.

318
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 Why?

319
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,960
 Because on that phone, it was my mum's phone.

320
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,280
 And a week or two before my dad passed away, he was messaging her and he was messaging

321
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,880
 her a really lovely, sentimental message.

322
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,600
 And so we've kept it.

323
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 To this day, it's there.

324
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,680
 And actually, when we go back home, I'll likely bring it out and have a look at it again.

325
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
 Why?

326
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,160
 Because it is valuable to us.

327
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,280
 Because we recognise, "Man, those were my dad's words.

328
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,040
 He typed those words to us, to my mum."

329
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,080
 And yet we don't hold this in a similar regard.

330
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,220
 This is God's love story for us.

331
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,580
 And yet we spend most of our days just feeling guilty about not reading it and just forcing

332
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,400
 ourselves to read like two verses.

333
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,240
 And then we wonder why we're unfamiliar with the big story.

334
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,400
 When we're surprised that we don't know how to live out our lives in this world right

335
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:54,760
 now, all Scripture is breathed out by God, profitable for correcting, teaching, rebuking,

336
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,800
 training, equipping us for every good work.

337
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,320
 That's what 2 Timothy 3 says.

338
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,960
 The point of Scripture is that we would be equipped, that we would know how to live in

339
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
 this world, that we would be equipped for every good work.

340
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,200
 Because here's the other problem.

341
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,880
 For those of us who are really good at reading Scripture, that we are just devout to it,

342
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 we are almost religious in reading Scripture.

343
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,240
 And actually there are some great programmes around.

344
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,440
 BSF is one of them, right?

345
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,320
 A great way to learn Scripture, even what Johnny was telling us about Ethan.

346
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,440
 It's a great start, isn't it?

347
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
 Just to learn Scripture.

348
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,480
 But you see, when it comes to Scripture, the point of it isn't just to fill our heads with

349
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
 knowledge.

350
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
 The Apostle Paul says, "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."

351
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,200
 The point is, how do we then use this to be equipped for every good work?

352
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,960
 How do we use this to show us how to navigate this broken world right now?

353
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,640
 That is what we're supposed to be using it for.

354
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,320
 Every time we read the Word of God, it demands a response.

355
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,020
 It demands action.

356
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,200
 It demands something in us has to change.

357
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,920
 Because if this is the Word of God, if this is written by the guy who created this world,

358
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,260
 then we take it seriously.

359
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,540
 The book of James says in chapter 122, "Let us be doers of the Word and not just hearers."

360
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,900
 Because if you say you believe, but you don't do anything with it, if you say you read the

361
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,620
 Bible, but you don't really respond to it, then your faith is dead.

362
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,180
 Whereas in Hebrews 4.12, it says, "The Word of God is living, is active, sharper than

363
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,660
 any double-edged sword."

364
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,940
 What can it do?

365
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,100
 It can pierce to the depths of your soul.

366
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,620
 If you allow it, if you open your heart when you read this book, it will tell you things

367
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,860
 about you that even you don't know about yourself.

368
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,900
 And then it will demand a response.

369
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,540
 That is what this book is about.

370
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,340
 But unfortunately, we rely on self-help tips.

371
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,120
 We rely on philosophy.

372
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,940
 We rely on sociology.

373
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,740
 We rely on psychology.

374
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,260
 We rely on all these different things when actually everything that we need.

375
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,820
 Scripture is the only reliable guide for us to navigate this world.

376
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,860
 So my goal today is to hopefully remind us of that.

377
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,340
 Remind us of that and encourage us to dive deep into this Word, knowing that it's not

378
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,020
 easy, but knowing that we are supposed to do it.

379
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,180
 And if you're not finding it easy, or if you don't know the Word, then I apologize to you

380
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,100
 because then we've done you injustice.

381
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,340
 That you've come into this church family and that we've not been rooted enough in this

382
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,340
 Word.

383
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,020
 And so that's a little bit about Scripture, about the Word of God.

384
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,860
 And I'll move into the second part where we'll actually open up the Word now and we'll read

385
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
 some.

386
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,700
 Because when we're talking about lacking sustained attention, I realize that I am the worst of

387
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
 them all.

388
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,860
 It's really hard to keep going in Scripture.

389
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,460
 And I'll tell you a little bit, these few months have been really hard, right?

390
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,700
 And a couple of weeks ago I shared about my emotional health, that it's not been great.

391
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,420
 And in January, I had that.

392
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,340
 When everything was kicking off, when things were just getting bad, I was telling God,

393
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,300
 "You know what, I'm just so done.

394
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,700
 So done with just all of this."

395
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,020
 And I remember going on a retreat with Him and I was just sat there like, "I have nothing

396
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,140
 to say to you.

397
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,420
 And you clearly don't really have much to say to me.

398
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,580
 So we're just going to sit in silence and we're going to have a staring contest.

399
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,580
 And that's it.

400
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,580
 It's going to be a good day.

401
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,820
 We'll just leave it at that."

402
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,980
 I felt compelled to open up His Word.

403
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,380
 And for the first time, and again, you can judge me for this if you want to, for this

404
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,580
 first time I read through, actually no, when Christina and I first dated when we were 18

405
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,220
 and 19, we actually read through the whole Bible together, cover to cover, every day.

406
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,020
 That was really surprising and impressive.

407
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,660
 I don't remember any of it.

408
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,380
 But anyway, because the whole objective was to impress her.

409
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:45,660
 So it worked, right?

410
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,260
 So in January, for the first time ever, we have nothing else to say.

411
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,660
 I just opened up the scripture and I started reading.

412
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,180
 And I read through the whole book of Philippians for the first time in one go.

413
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,060
 And I was like, "I've never done that before."

414
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,260
 My favorite basketball player, Steph Curry, his favorite verse is Philippians 4.13.

415
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,460
 "I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."

416
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
 He writes it on his shoes.

417
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
 I know that verse.

418
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,820
 I know a couple of other verses.

419
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,600
 But to see it all in one go blew my mind.

420
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,060
 It blew my mind because it changed the way I saw life.

421
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,620
 It changed the way I saw everything and I wanted to give you a glimpse of that today.

422
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:28,020
 And I want to ask you, as you hear me read scripture, and we'll pray in a minute before

423
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,220
 I do it, I want you to notice a few things.

424
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,420
 Paul was writing this letter to the church in Philippi, which is the first ever church

425
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,500
 in Europe.

426
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,880
 He was writing towards the end of his life and he was in prison with no idea whether

427
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,360
 he would be able to get out this time.

428
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
 This could be it.

429
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
 He could be done.

430
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,660
 And he's writing to this church there in Philippi and I want you to notice a few things as we

431
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
 read it.

432
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,220
 I want you to notice how he yearns for his brothers and sisters, how he just wants to

433
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
 be with them.

434
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,340
 I want you to notice how he feels about prison, how he feels about life.

435
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,580
 And then we sang a few songs, actually.

436
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,460
 Well done, Florence, for choosing those songs, where you get to see how Paul perceives the

437
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,780
 world, the things that are valuable in this world.

438
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,240
 And you get to see how he navigates all that and how he finishes.

439
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,000
 And so I pray as I read through this scripture and that we would absorb this, we would let

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,920
 this Holy Spirit minister to us himself as I open up the Word of God.

441
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,600
 And I pray, and I will pray now.

442
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
 Let's just pray.

443
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:37,920
 Lord, as we open up your Word, as we recognize how valuable it is, that it is breathed out,

444
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:46,000
 inspired by you, given to us to equip us for every good work, to equip us to show us how

445
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,800
 to live so we wouldn't just be hearers, but we would be doers.

446
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,200
 And I pray that as I read this letter that Paul wrote to Philippi, this letter that really

447
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,260
 speaks into our hearts, this letter is about rejoicing whilst being in prison.

448
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,400
 May it remind us to find joy whilst living in Hong Kong.

449
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,560
 And Holy Spirit, I know that we can't even understand your words without you.

450
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,480
 You are the one who reveals, you are the one who teaches the mysteries of God.

451
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,000
 And so I thank you that you're here, I welcome you being here, and I pray that as I read

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,660
 these words from this precious, precious book, we as a church would be rooted in your teachings

453
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,560
 and we would be sensitive to your Spirit.

454
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,680
 We thank you, Lord, for this.

455
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,480
 It's in your name we pray.

456
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 Amen.

457
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,960
 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are

458
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,080
 at Philippi, to the overseers and deacons, grace to you and peace from God our Father

459
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,840
 and the Lord Jesus Christ.

460
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,200
 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all,

461
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,520
 making my prayer with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day

462
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,680
 until now.

463
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,960
 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion

464
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,440
 at the day of Christ.

465
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,280
 I am right to feel this way about you all because I hold you in my heart, for you are

466
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,000
 all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defence and confirmation

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,560
 of the gospel.

468
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:34,440
 For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.

469
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,440
 And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment

470
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,120
 so that you may approve what is excellent and be pure and blameless at the day of Christ,

471
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,600
 that you'd be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ.

472
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,780
 So the glory and praise of God.

473
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,960
 I want you to know brothers, what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel

474
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,200
 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that

475
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,800
 my imprisonment is for Christ.

476
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 And most of the brothers, having become confident by my imprisonment, are much more bold to

477
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,880
 speak the word without fear.

478
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,680
 Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, others out of goodwill.

479
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,920
 The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defence of the gospel.

480
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:30,280
 The former proclaim Christ from envy, selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict

481
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,560
 me in my imprisonment.

482
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,200
 What then?

483
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,480
 Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed.

484
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
 And in that, I rejoice.

485
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,600
 Yes, I will rejoice for I know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of

486
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,840
 Jesus Christ, this will turn out for my deliverance as it is my eager expectation and hope that

487
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,360
 I will not at all be ashamed but that with full courage now, Christ as always will be

488
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,320
 honoured in my body, whether by life or by death.

489
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:12,000
 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

490
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,800
 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me.

491
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,360
 At which I shall choose, I can't tell.

492
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,320
 I am hard pressed between the two.

493
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,320
 My desire is to be with Christ for that is far better.

494
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,280
 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.

495
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,640
 Convinced of this, I know I will remain and continue with you all in your progress and

496
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,320
 joy in the faith so that in me, you would have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus.

497
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,560
 Because of my coming again to you only, let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel

498
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
 of Christ.

499
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,040
 So whether I am to come and see or am absent, I may hear of you standing firm in one spirit

500
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:58,320
 with one mind, striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, not frightened in anything

501
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,920
 by your opponents.

502
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,360
 This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation and that from God.

503
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,760
 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ, that you would not only believe

504
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,400
 in him but would suffer for his sake.

505
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,360
 Engage in the same conflict that you saw that I had and now hear that I still have.

506
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:26,040
 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in

507
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:34,880
 the spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of one mind, having the same

508
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,600
 love, being in full accord and of one mind.

509
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,760
 Do nothing from selfish ambition and conceit but consider others more significant than

510
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
 yourself.

511
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,760
 Let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others.

512
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:57,080
 Have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the

513
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,260
 form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped but emptied himself.

514
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,800
 Taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men and being found in human

515
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:15,280
 form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross.

516
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,320
 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name so

517
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,240
 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth

518
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,460
 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.

519
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,360
 To the glory of God the Father.

520
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,920
 For my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now not only as in my presence but much

521
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:46,680
 more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

522
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,460
 For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.

523
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,560
 Do all things without grumbling or disputing so that you'll be blameless and innocent,

524
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,640
 children of God without blemish in the midst of this crooked and twisted generation among

525
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,360
 whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life so that in the day

526
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,880
 of Christ that I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labour in vain.

527
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,000
 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith,

528
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,120
 I am glad and rejoice with you all.

529
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,960
 Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.

530
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,480
 I hope in the Lord to send Timothy to you soon so that I may rejoice at hearing about

531
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,600
 you, for I have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare, for

532
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,200
 they all seek their own interests and not of Jesus Christ.

533
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,680
 But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he served with me in

534
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,320
 the gospel.

535
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,520
 I hope therefore to send him to you just as soon as I see how it will go with me, and

536
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,240
 I hope in the Lord that I shortly can come also.

537
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,760
 I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and my fellow worker and my fellow

538
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,400
 soldier, your messenger and minister to my need.

539
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,520
 Fear has been longing for you all, but he has been distressed because you heard he was

540
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 ill.

541
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,320
 Indeed he was ill, near to death.

542
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,760
 But God had mercy on him, but not only on him, but also on me, lest I should have sorrow

543
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,800
 upon sorrow.

544
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,200
 And the more eager therefore to send him to you, so that you may rejoice at seeing him

545
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,240
 again and that I may be less anxious.

546
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,240
 So receive him in the Lord with all joy.

547
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:30,560
 And he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking

548
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,080
 in your service to me.

549
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,640
 Bear with me, we're here, we're halfway through.

550
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,000
 Finally brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

551
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,980
 To write the same things to you is of no trouble to me and is safe for you.

552
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,800
 Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh,

553
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,980
 for we are the circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus

554
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,200
 and put no confidence in the flesh.

555
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,520
 Though I myself actually have reason for confidence in the flesh also.

556
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,960
 If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more.

557
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,560
 Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew

558
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:15,560
 of Hebrews, as to the law, a Pharisee, as to the righteousness, a zeal, a persecutor

559
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,920
 of the church, as to righteousness under the law, blameless.

560
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,780
 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.

561
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:29,460
 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ

562
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,660
 Jesus my Lord.

563
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,560
 For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order

564
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,100
 that I may gain Christ and be found in him.

565
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,220
 Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through

566
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:49,180
 faith in Christ, a righteousness of God that depends on faith, that I may know him and

567
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,660
 the power of his resurrection, may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death

568
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,820
 and by any means possible attaining the resurrection from the dead.

569
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,020
 Not that I've already obtained this or I'm already perfect, but I press on to make it

570
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,860
 my own because Christ Jesus made me his own.

571
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,580
 Stop.

572
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:16,420
 Brothers, I don't consider I've made it my own, but one thing I do.

573
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,340
 Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward

574
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,700
 the goal for the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

575
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,060
 Let those of us who are mature think this way and if anything you think otherwise, let

576
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,500
 God reveal that also to you.

577
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,900
 Only let us hold true to what we have attained.

578
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,500
 Brothers, join in imitating me and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example

579
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
 that you have in us.

580
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,340
 For many, as I've often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the

581
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,700
 cross of Christ.

582
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,980
 Their end is destruction.

583
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,300
 Their God is their belly.

584
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,860
 Their glory in their shame.

585
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:57,140
 Their minds set on earthy things, but our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await

586
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,660
 a saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious

587
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,100
 body by the power that enables him to subject all things to himself.

588
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:13,340
 Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord,

589
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
 my beloved.

590
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,980
 I entreat you Odier and Sintek to agree in the Lord.

591
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,540
 Yes, I also ask you, help these women who have laboured side by side with me in the

592
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,140
 gospel together with Clement and the rest of the fellow workers whose names are in the

593
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
 book of life.

594
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,100
 You recognise this, Peter?

595
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
 Rejoice in the Lord.

596
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,100
 Again, I will say rejoice.

597
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,900
 Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.

598
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
 The Lord is at hand.

599
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:42,220
 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving

600
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,300
 let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding

601
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,900
 will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

602
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:59,780
 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever

603
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:06,140
 is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence,

604
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,860
 if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.

605
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,540
 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practise these things and

606
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,860
 the God of peace will be with you.

607
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,540
 I rejoice greatly now that you have revived your concern for me.

608
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
 At length.

609
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,500
 You were indeed concerned, but you had no opportunity.

610
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,540
 Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned that in whatever situation

611
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,580
 I am to be content.

612
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,340
 I know how to be brought low.

613
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,620
 I know how to abound.

614
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,580
 In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance

615
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
 and need.

616
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,580
 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

617
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,340
 Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble.

618
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:54,660
 And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel when I left Macedonia

619
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,260
 no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only.

620
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:06,020
 Even in Thessalonica you sent help for my needs.

621
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
 And I am well supplied.

622
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,860
 I have received full payment and more, having received from Epaphroditus the gift that you

623
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:16,500
 sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.

624
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,940
 And my God will supply every need of yours according to the riches of his glory in Christ

625
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:27,700
 Jesus, to our God the Father be glory forever and ever.

626
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.

627
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,860
 All the brothers who are with me greet you.

628
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,780
 All the saints greet you.

629
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,500
 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

630
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,460
 This is the word of the Lord.

631
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,460
 Amen.

632
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:51,660
 I don't know how you found that.

633
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,980
 It may have been hard.

634
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,580
 It may have allowed you to start nodding off.

635
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,220
 And that's okay.

636
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,020
 It really is.

637
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,780
 But don't stay here.

638
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,200
 Don't stay where you are right now.

639
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,620
 Don't navigate this world without this.

640
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,700
 Hang on it's every word.

641
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
 Push your church.

642
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
 Push me.

643
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
 Push John.

644
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
 Push Johnny.

645
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
 Push Michelle.

646
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,060
 To open up the word of God to you.

647
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,200
 Because this is the only reliable guide.

648
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,900
 This is the only thing that we can hang on in this dark world where truth is going missing.

649
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,580
 And brothers and sisters we have this truth right here on our apps.

650
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,580
 In multiple apps.

651
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:39,180
 But I don't want to finish us there and just leave it there.

652
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:46,260
 If you feel that actually you want to do more with the Bible but you just don't know where

653
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,980
 to start I want to give you some handles just to hold on to.

654
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:59,460
 The Apostle Peter was a changed man in Acts 2 before he delivered the gospel.

655
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
 Why?

656
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,460
 Because of the Holy Spirit.

657
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,240
 So if you're thinking what do I need to do to read the Bible?

658
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 To understand the Bible?

659
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,340
 I encourage you.

660
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,340
 The first thing is this.

661
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,500
 There's actually two people you need to talk to.

662
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
 Okay?

663
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,180
 Let's just leave with two action points here.

664
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,300
 Number one, talk to the Holy Spirit.

665
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,880
 Pray to him.

666
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,540
 Every time you open up his word just go, "I'm lost with this.

667
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,820
 I'm confused with this book."

668
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,620
 If you're real and if this is truth, show me.

669
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,440
 Number one, pray to the Holy Spirit and ask him to open this up to you.

670
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,460
 Number two, find someone real like human flesh right next to you.

671
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,460
 Read it together.

672
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,900
 We are a word rooted church.

673
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,020
 We're supposed to open up the word of God together.

674
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,180
 We're supposed to devote ourselves to the public teaching of scripture.

675
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,380
 So find one person.

676
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,900
 That's all you need.

677
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,560
 One person and say, "You know what?

678
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,360
 Something happened to me this evening that I think I need this truth."

679
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,960
 Find that one person and just say, "Can you read with me?

680
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,420
 Can you hold me accountable?

681
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,980
 Can we just message each other every day and just say, 'Have we read one chapter together?'"

682
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:22,060
 Whatever it may be, don't let anything stop you because this is truth.

683
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,100
 Because this is what will help you get you through life.

684
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,020
 This is what our church should be based on.

685
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,620
 It is what we should be rooted on.

686
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
 Amen?

687
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,620
 Amen.

688
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
 Let's pray.

689
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:54,980
 Father, we come before you and we are just grateful that you would leave us this word.

690
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,420
 Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light unto our path.

691
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,580
 Your word is like honey on our lips.

692
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,100
 So use it, Lord.

693
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:15,660
 Use it to pierce through the very depths of our souls and use it to equip us for every

694
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,820
 good work.

695
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:25,180
 Forgive us that we neglect it, sometimes mistreat it, sometimes we just forget.

696
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,700
 Lord, we thank you that your grace and your patience abounds.

697
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,340
 And you know that we can't do this on our own.

698
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:40,100
 So we pray, one, for your Holy Spirit to shine that light unto us when we read, when we go

699
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,340
 through the hard books, when we find things that we don't understand, your Holy Spirit,

700
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,660
 would you read it with us?

701
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,420
 Would you open up your word with us?

702
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,900
 And second, Lord, can you bind us together as one?

703
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:01,380
 Would you show us the people that you've placed around us who we can do this with together?

704
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,940
 We're not supposed to do this on our own.

705
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,540
 We are supposed to be a church together.

706
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:14,220
 And so Lord, we plead, we pray that we would be a church that is rooted in your word.

707
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,260
 In your name I pray, amen.
