[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.440]   Can you hear me?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.440]   I feel like I can't hear myself.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.440]   Okay.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.520]   It's great to be with you guys.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.440]   I'm really glad to be sharing a message today.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.760]   It's been on my heart to share about what it really means to bear one another's burden.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.480]   Because many a times, you just think that we can come into faith, and this is a one-to-one
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   thing where it's a relationship between just us and God.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.080]   But God has actually given us a community to be with.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.680]   And we've not only called to have a one-on-one relationship with God, but we've been called
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.400]   to have a relationship with the people around us in the community.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.180]   And so today, we're gonna be looking at how we can bear one another's burden by looking
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.440]   at Galatians chapter six, verse one to two.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.720]   Now before we get to that, I do wanna tell you a little bit of a background of what the
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.680]   book of Galatians was like.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.820]   Now at that time, it was actually a letter written by Apostle Paul, and he was telling
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.840]   the churches in Galatia an issue that was disturbing them.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.280]   Now what was the issue?
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.000]   The issue was that there were agitators, and they were telling the people that even though
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.560]   you have believed in Jesus, you still needed to follow the laws that were handed down by
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.760]   Moses.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.880]   And now, Apostle Paul knew that this isn't right, so he wrote letters.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.040]   And this letter, all six chapters address the different points that he wanted to tell
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.520]   the people there.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.160]   And so as we look into this book, this is what we're gonna see.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.440]   And so he's been trying to tell them that don't live by the laws, don't just follow
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.720]   them like rules, instead live in the spirit.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.440]   And if you, one of the more famous passages from Galatians chapter five is that, the fruit
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.120]   of the spirits, and do you know all the fruit of the spirits?
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   Yes.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.840]   Love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.520]   Don't forget patience, yes.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.780]   Self-control.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.640]   And why is it that he's asking them to do that?
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.880]   Is because right before then, he's saying that you need to live by the spirit.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.000]   It doesn't mean that the law doesn't matter anymore, because the law is actually lived
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.520]   through the spirit.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.720]   What that means is when you live by the spirit and have all these fruits, you have already
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.120]   followed the laws.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.400]   And what does the law say?
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.320]   The law actually wanted people to be away from the flesh.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.860]   What was the flesh?
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.440]   So it would be being jealous of one another, envy, it would be ways that we would just
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.840]   wanna be a part of, we wanna take over what people have.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.600]   And so, Apostle Paul really is telling everyone, "Hey, don't live in the flesh, but instead
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.480]   live in the spirit."
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.000]   And then he started introducing to us what it means to live in the spirit as a community.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.320]   And that's when we get to chapter six.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.560]   So I've just given you the background and now I want us to read together Galatians six
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.040]   verse one to two.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.680]   Okay, shall we read it together?
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680]   All right, one, two, three.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.280]   "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.520]   the spirit of gentleness.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.920]   Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.760]   Bear one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ."
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.480]   Now when you first read this, you're like, "Yeah, I think I pretty much get the whole
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.480]   verse.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.600]   Are we gonna spend like all 30 minutes on this?"
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.560]   Well, yes and no.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.960]   So when you first read this, I don't know about you, but I started to have some questions.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.800]   For example, when Paul says that we're to restore someone in the spirit of gentleness,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   what does that mean?
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.400]   I mean, I get all the words spirit and gentleness, but how is that different from just gentleness?
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.720]   And when he keeps going and says, "Lest you be tempted."
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.280]   Now why would we be tempted if we were trying to restore someone?
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.120]   If we were trying to ask people, "Hey, don't steal."
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.320]   Does it mean that I'm gonna be tempted in stealing?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.560]   And also we keep reading and there's this bear one another's burden.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.300]   We understand all those words, but what does that really look like in our everyday life?
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.280]   And also he also says that it is to fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.760]   Now I explained a little bit about that earlier, but you know that the law of Christ, this
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.480]   phrase, it's only found here.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.320]   It has only appeared in the Bible once.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   So now what is he trying to say?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.640]   So we will get to all those one at a time, but I do want to start us off by thinking
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.980]   about when we bear in one another's burden, the very first thing that Apostle Paul is
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.140]   telling us is that it is in Jesus' way.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.320]   What does it mean to be in Jesus' way?
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.480]   That means that when we bear one another's burden, we're not doing it in our way.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.560]   We're not doing it in the flesh or how people tell us, but we're doing it in Jesus' way.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.640]   And now we can see that he's actually used the spirit of gentleness to tell us about
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   that.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.440]   Now when we use it in Jesus' spirit, what is really the main difference?
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:54.240]   Now the English word for gentleness, it means to be tender, to be kind, but in our sense,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   in the biblical sense, when we're talking about the spirit of gentleness, it's more
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.320]   than that.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.200]   Do you know what that is?
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.140]   It is when we have compassion for someone else.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.820]   It is when we can stand in their shoes and say, "We understand.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.900]   Why is it that this has happened to you?"
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.720]   Now let me explain a little bit more and maybe it'll give you a more flavor to that.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.080]   Well it means that when, I remember there were, when I was a kid, wait a minute, I'd
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.280]   actually never stole cookies, but somebody did steal cookies and they would steal the
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.800]   cookie and what would they do?
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.720]   When they were caught, they would be scared.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   Why?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.480]   Because they knew that they would be condemned, probably by parents or by teachers.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.280]   And so they weren't looking forward to that.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   And I mean, we don't have to even go to kids.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.960]   We can go to our dogs.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.600]   I mean, when I used to have a dog, he would take my socks and he would chew it up.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.360]   And you know, when I come home, I would never be able to find him.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.760]   But when I did, you know that his ear is going to be dripped down and he's going to have
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.400]   that innocent look on his face.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   Why?
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.480]   Only so that I won't condemn him and that I won't punish him.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.640]   Now you might be thinking, "What does the dog and that have to do with us, gentleness?"
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.280]   Well really it's trying to tell us that remember when Jesus, actually when the Pharisees in
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.320]   the scribes brought a lady who was caught in adultery to Jesus and they asked Jesus,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.120]   "What shall we do with him in order to test him?"
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.320]   And Jesus said that...
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.240]   They said that, "What does the law say?"
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.720]   The law asks for punishment.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:55.040]   And so Jesus said, "All right, well anybody who has not sinned, you can stone her to death."
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.340]   And now from the old to the young, they left because everyone has sinned.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.720]   And so Jesus then stood up and told the woman, "Where's everybody?"
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.240]   "Well, neither will I condemn you, but do not sin anymore."
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.240]   And so we can see that in the spirit of gentleness, we have this first point that when we bear
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:25.480]   one another's burden in Jesus' way, the very first way is we do it in his spirit, having
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.200]   his character.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.520]   This is not about us being nice to someone.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:36.840]   It is about us living out the spirit of God so that people will know who God is.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:43.120]   And so when we bear each other's burdens, we who first do it in his spirit, and that
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.680]   would be doing it Jesus' way.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:55.360]   Now as we read on, we're going to see that because Jesus doesn't only address to one
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.500]   group of people, he actually addresses to different people and their different needs.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:09.000]   And the second way that I want to say that we can bear each other's burden is that we
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.560]   need to address to all the people's burdens, to all the people at all times.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.360]   Now Jesus never says, "Oh, well, I can take care of this person's sickness, but I won't
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.000]   take care of this person."
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   He's not.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   He shows no partiality.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.600]   He's going to help this person.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.280]   He's going to help that person when they need it.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.200]   And so when we're following Jesus, we're doing the same thing.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.600]   We're not choosing people that we know a bit better so that we'll just help those.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   And we're not choosing, "Oh, this burden seems easy.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.720]   I think I'll go for this one.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   That one's kind of hard.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.400]   I'm going to save it for Pastor John or someone else."
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.600]   No, we're going to be just like Jesus when we carry each other's burdens.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.220]   And this, Jesus tells us that when we bear each other's burden, we're actually fulfilling
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.000]   the law of Christ.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.400]   Now this is very important because we want to fulfill God and what he requires of us.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:18.600]   And yet it tells us that in here, we're not just meeting it like those items on a rule.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.480]   We're not meeting it like, "Oh, I've done this.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   I've done this.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   I've done this."
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.600]   No, he's saying that the law of Christ, what is that?
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:35.060]   And if we have read it before, that the Bible says Jesus has summed it up and that the first
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.520]   one is to love your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul, with
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.800]   all your heart.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.840]   And then the second one is what?
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.080]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:52.160]   And so the third way really for us to be bearing one another's burden in Jesus' way is that
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   we are loving them, not because there's a rule that says we need to, but because we
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.220]   genuinely care and love for them like Jesus does.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.080]   And so we want to give you a bit of flavor about what that really is, because in this
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:16.480]   passage we can see that Apostle Paul has used this example to show us that the spirit of
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:23.300]   gentleness was for when someone was caught in a transgression.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.300]   But there are other fruits of the spirit, other characters of those, that in different
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.280]   scenarios we're going to carry them out too.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.200]   So for example, instead of condemning someone when they're caught, we mentioned that we're
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.880]   going to be compassionate about them.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.600]   Now, instead of being angry, we're going to be kind to them.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.740]   So there are all these different ways.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.840]   And when we see that someone has a need, we're going to use, or Holy Spirit is going to help
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.560]   us so that one of the characteristics or more of the characteristics of the spirit is being
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   manifested.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.720]   So today we're very glad that we're able to invite one of our clan leader, Josh, to help
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.000]   us share about how it is that in our everyday life we're going to see that in action.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.040]   So let's give him a warm welcome.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.920]   No, I'm going to sit down.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.920]   Hey everyone.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.320]   For those of you who don't know me, my name is Josh.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.520]   I'm one of the clan leaders here.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.380]   And Michelle asked me to kind of come up during this part and share a little bit about how
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.960]   community and bearing with one another's burdens can look like in real life.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.200]   But before I do, let me just ask you, what is a burden?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.880]   Do you guys know?
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.160]   What are some of the burdens that we have?
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.560]   Any thoughts?
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.680]   There are lots of different things which are included in the concept of burdens, whether
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:47.120]   it be sin, whether it be challenges, whether it be temptations, like it says in verse one,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.600]   these are the burdens that Paul is calling for us as Christians to bear.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.800]   So I was part of a small group back many years ago when I was much, much younger.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.040]   And we came together because we felt through reading scripture, like this passage, that
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.760]   we should gather together in community and help each other bear with temptations and
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.440]   with the challenges of sin, like it says in verse one.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.280]   And I think a lot of church groups, a lot of Christians, they know that this is something
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280]   that we should do.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.560]   How many of you guys have heard something similar, that we should gather in community?
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   Okay.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   Oh, not that many of you.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   Okay.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.880]   Let me tell you first, you should gather together in community because there's a lot of things
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.120]   which we are called to do as Christians, which are not easy to do.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.600]   A lot of temptations to avoid, a lot of accountability to be had.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.320]   So we came together to read the word of God, to pray together, to hold each other accountable,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.840]   all the good Christian stuff.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:51.920]   But one day we were gathered and one of the people in our small group had a very serious
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.960]   medical emergency.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.680]   His knee ruptured, like that.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.040]   It exploded while he was doing some sporting activity, which he really shouldn't have been
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.200]   doing and it was a mess.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.960]   And he was visiting Hong Kong for a medium term amount of time.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.840]   He didn't have access to public healthcare and as such he couldn't fix his knee.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.320]   So he couldn't walk, he couldn't get it fixed, he couldn't fly to go back home to the States
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.520]   to get his knee fixed.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.680]   And so he was kind of stuck.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.000]   Now we were all in our group, we were quite young and poor.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.040]   Many of us were still in uni, some of us were just starting our careers.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:32.900]   But as we considered the word of God and we read that we should bear one another's burdens,
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.320]   we realized that those burdens didn't just mean praying for one another, dealing with
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.600]   sin, helping each other with temptation, but also with practical realities as well.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.920]   It also includes, by the way, bearing with one another's questions and patience, but
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.400]   we'll get to that another time.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.520]   So we came together and we helped him out.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.440]   We paid for all of his medical bills as a group.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.720]   Thankfully we were a somewhat large group at the time, so we were able to chip in enough
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:02.000]   money to pay for his medical bills so that he could get a knee reconstruction surgery,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.400]   he'd get all the swelling taken out.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.560]   He healed up, managed to make it back to the States in one piece, injured his knee again
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.360]   but then got better, and it was good.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.800]   You know, one of the things that happened as a result of us obeying the word of God
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:25.480]   was that our community, our small group, became so much closer than I'd ever thought possible.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.560]   Some of you who know my current small group know that we're really tight.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.720]   We're like a spiritual family.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   We do everything together.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.920]   We go on vacations together, we hang out with one another.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.720]   That really started from that one moment.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.880]   When we are not only praying for one another, not only encouraging one another to deal with
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.680]   sin, but we also help each other, you know, putting people through university, making
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.840]   sure that we are always looking out for one another physically.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.480]   If someone's father, like say, has a stroke and they need help with medical support, we
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.440]   all chip in in those areas.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.640]   That really draws us together in community.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:11.880]   I would encourage us as a church that we are called to bear with one another's burdens,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:19.840]   both spiritual and physical, both in the church when it comes to dealing with the many challenges
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.560]   of temptation, but also practical as well.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:31.780]   And you know, there are so many challenges that face Christians today, with so many different
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:38.280]   polarizing opinions out there, so many different ways to get angry at stuff.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:44.880]   We can hold each other accountable in having right attitudes and in dealing with many of
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.120]   the challenges of hate that exist, but we can also support one another.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.760]   So I would encourage you, if you're not part of a community now, if you're not part of
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.960]   a small group, what we call clans here, our community life and nurture groups, if you're
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.280]   not part of one of those, I would encourage you to take part, to be part of that community.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.600]   And as you are, feel free to invest in one another.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.680]   Help one another as you deal with temptations or challenges.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:22.200]   Help the other people in your clan who might be struggling with actual physical medical
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.760]   conditions or hardships.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:32.320]   If someone needs help with looking after their newborn kid, help them out with that.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   I would encourage...
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.440]   Wow, it took you guys really long, right?
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   So...
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.920]   No, no, it's cool, it's cool.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   But I would say, you know, honestly, I have been super blessed.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.400]   Being part of my small group, which is the same small group after many years, has been
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.840]   one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and I would not have been able to
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.240]   survive through so many of the different stages of my life and the many challenges that I've
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.400]   faced over the last six, seven years if it wasn't for my clan.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.520]   So if you guys aren't part of one, I would really encourage you to look into getting
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.520]   one, getting to be part of one.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.880]   I know there's several starting, I know that Michelle is starting a bunch of new ones,
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.280]   I know that there are a lot that are looking to grow.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.160]   So yeah, I would really say it's one of the best things ever.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.880]   It does take a little bit of work, a lot of crazy people in there, but it's awesome to
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.160]   be part of a community in the church.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.520]   So I encourage you guys with that.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:40.160]   Thank you, Josh.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:46.960]   I mean, as Josh was sharing, I think one of the things that I really saw in those moments
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.800]   when they chipped in, when they were there for one another, you know what that was?
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:58.440]   That they were loving one another just like they would for themselves.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.440]   So I think that's beautiful, how he shared it.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.720]   And so when we do that, when we're in a community, when we support one another and carry each
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.080]   other's burdens, we're able to fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:21.000]   So now as we move on to look at, there are other things that these two verses are telling
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.320]   us that we need to watch out.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.240]   Now one of the things is we need to watch out for ourselves.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.200]   Now remember the line where it says, "Watch out that you don't be tempted."
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   Remember that one?
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.440]   It's right, "Keep watch on yourself, least you be tempted."
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.760]   Now all of a sudden he mentions this.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.560]   Why does he do that?
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:49.440]   Now because, imagine this, that you're helping out that person, you're helping out this person,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.520]   and before you know it, what do you feel like?
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.040]   You feel like a superman.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.400]   You're like a superwoman, right?
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.520]   And very soon maybe they were sharing with you about some burdens that they have, and
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:08.460]   it's easy for us to start judging them and start saying that, "Oh, I'm so much better.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.520]   I'm so much smarter, I'm able to withhold these things, and I'm not having problems
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.240]   in these areas."
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.120]   So it's easy for us that when we're helping someone, when we're carrying other people's
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.000]   burden that we will fall into this trap.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.120]   So really Paul is telling us, "Watch out.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.640]   Keep watch for yourself."
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.760]   Because if we don't, we can easily then fall into that trap and someone will have to get
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.080]   us out, right?
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.900]   Someone will have to tell us and carry our burden for falling in that trap.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:46.940]   And so another thing that we have to do is that when we do that, when we know that we
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:52.620]   can easily be tempted to, it makes us know that we're human beings.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.900]   Remember I said, "You don't wanna think that you're a superhero."
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.720]   We're just human beings.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:04.160]   And the only way that we were ever able to not fall into certain transgressions or not
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.680]   have certain weakness was only because God had been sustaining us.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.880]   And so when we recognize that and when we acknowledge that we might fall into temptation
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.700]   and watch for ourselves, we're able to prevent that from happening and we're able to know
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.560]   that we are just humans.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.120]   And you know what's the best part about being just humans?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.740]   That means we don't have to be perfect.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:33.600]   It means that after you've tried to help someone, tried to carry their burden, and somehow if
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.540]   it still didn't work out, that it's okay.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.240]   It's okay to be humans.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:49.880]   And at the same time, once we're able to overcome that temptation, once we're able to say, "Hey,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.280]   I was so close to being tempted, but God helped me through maybe reading the Bible or maybe
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.480]   he just reminded me that, hey, this is happening.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.680]   I'm realizing that there's a change in my emotions towards a certain person after I've
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.040]   helped them."
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.800]   Then we're able to help others and we're able to help ourselves because we become stronger
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.360]   Christians and we are able then to be a more mature Christian.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   So throughout this, while we're bearing each other's burden, while we're carrying these
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.280]   out, not only do we carry them out in Jesus' way, but at the same time, we need to watch
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.520]   out to make sure that we don't fall into any temptations.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.680]   Now the last part is that we bear each other's burden knowing that it takes two.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.480]   I wanted to say it takes two to tangle, but I actually don't know how to tangle, so I
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.240]   thought I'll leave that out.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.920]   So it takes two.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   What does that mean?
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:53.000]   If you are going to bear one another, it means that there's someone bearing and there's someone
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.080]   allowing you to bear.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.680]   And what that means is, first thing is we need each other.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.200]   I mean, all of us need each other.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:08.680]   There's not one person here that never needs someone else and they can just live by themselves.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.040]   Wait, saving Private Ryan, was there someone that lived by himself?
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.400]   But we're not called for that.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.320]   We were called to live in a community where we need one another.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.440]   Because sometimes I'm weak and you're able to help me.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   Sometimes you're weak and I'm able to help you.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.520]   Hopefully we're not weak at the same time, but even if we were, we can help each other.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:38.320]   And so knowing that we need each other is a way for us to humble ourselves.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:45.360]   And at the same time, if we're the one that needs our burdens to be carried, we actually
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.960]   have the responsibility to speak up.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.800]   Now I know some of us like to go solo.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.040]   Some of us don't want to burden other people.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:01.360]   Some of us think that if we have to depend on someone, it's a sign of weakness.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.080]   But really it isn't.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:11.000]   When we are able to speak up, it is speaking from a sign of humility and also a sign of
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.280]   strength.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.800]   Because we're able to recognize that, "Hey, it's okay.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.500]   I'm a human being and I can accept myself to be imperfect."
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.120]   That is strength and humility.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.760]   And it's okay that if I tell someone about it, I'm not worried that because they know
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.520]   this, now they're going to look badly at me.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.560]   And even if they are, I'm so confident that it doesn't matter.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.320]   I'm not going to be affected by it.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:44.960]   So when we're able to speak up of our needs, it is standing from a position of strength.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.680]   And so for us to learn that role is so important.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.900]   Because if we don't, then we can end up just being by ourselves, not getting the support
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.520]   that we need from the community that God has blessed us with.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.320]   Now the other part, of course, the other party is that we need to be intentional.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.520]   We need to be intentional in helping the people that aren't able to speak up.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:18.760]   Because sometimes, just like us today, sitting here today, you're not going to know the things
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.840]   that the other person is going through if we're not intentional about it.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.120]   Because we can all have a nice smile and we can ask, "Hey, how are you doing?"
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.440]   And you know what?
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   We get the standard answer, "Oh, I'm good.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   I'm fine."
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.240]   And that's it, right?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.480]   And then maybe there's this awkward silence and we're not sure quite what to do with it.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.920]   But if we're intentional, we can ask open-ended questions.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.080]   So maybe we can ask instead of, "Hey, how's it going?"
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.920]   Which we kind of know the standard answer.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.000]   We can ask things like, "Hey, what has been on your mind lately?"
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.640]   Unless they say blank, but most likely not.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.000]   They're usually going to share with you, "Oh, I was worried about this.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.360]   My exam's coming up."
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.760]   Or, "I had a fight with someone."
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.760]   And so it starts a conversation and we have to be intentional.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:12.960]   And of course, when we start that conversation, it also means that if we're intentional, we
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:20.400]   have to set aside some time to really listen to what is happening in their lives.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.520]   So today, I actually want to share with you a story recently that happened.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:32.000]   And I think it really spoke to me about what it means to bear each other's burden.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.080]   So last week, I was off the entire week.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.820]   I got the whole week to go to my school so that I could study for an intensive course.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.320]   So I was in day four.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:48.000]   Okay, what an intensive course means is that we start early at nine and finish at five.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.520]   And the only break that we get is the lunch break.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.560]   I mean, we do get snippets of breaks, but pretty much is the whole day.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.840]   So I was on my fourth day exhausted.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.240]   And of course, last week, I happened to be preaching as well.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.560]   So I was trying to work on my sermon at nighttime and trying to get that done.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.800]   So I was exhausted, but I was very happy because it was Thursday evening.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.080]   So I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.000]   And I thought, "All right, just a little bit more and it'll be there."
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.680]   So I was just very comfortable getting water at the pantry.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.120]   And then I see my classmate walking in and just doing my standard thing.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.240]   I gave them the nice smile and I said, "Hey, how's it going?"
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.200]   I was not very intentional there.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.960]   I was hoping for the "I'm okay" answer.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.280]   So I just getting water, "Hey, how's it going?"
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.960]   And then she said, "I'm not doing well."
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:49.760]   She said, "Something happened at my church," which actually was unexpected because I actually
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   looked at my app and my bus was 10 minutes away.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.600]   So I was thinking I will catch it right after I get the water, even though the bus stop
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.080]   is right outside.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.020]   So I was like, "Oh, well."
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.440]   So struggling a bit, but I said, "Oh, so what happened?"
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:12.680]   I wanted to know within five minutes time frame.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:22.080]   And then she said, "My brother from church, much older, is an older man.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.400]   He just committed suicide yesterday."
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.120]   And so when I heard that, I was like, "Oh."
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:37.320]   And I was just feeling synced because I've also had family members who had that issue.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.040]   And so I really thought, "Wow, this is so sad.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.320]   How is she doing?"
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.160]   So I said, "How did it happen?
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.240]   What happened?"
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.520]   And so she said, "Actually, this man, he has been going to our church for a few years now.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:59.380]   He's baptized and he comes to all of our whatever outings we have, whatever activities we have,
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.400]   he comes to all of those."
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.640]   And this was really shocking.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.960]   And even last week, he was at the prayer meeting.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:15.040]   And so when I heard that, I was like, "This is really bad."
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.720]   Now I just want to show you the flesh side of me, the human side of me.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:27.660]   I was actually checking the clock in the back to see if I would catch my bus.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:33.800]   And I really struggled because I thought to myself, "All right, I have to wake up at seven
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.440]   in the morning the next day to go to class.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.800]   I do want to ask her more and to give her some comfort."
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.760]   But I also thought about the sermon that was not done.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:50.600]   And I also thought about, you know, I'm actually a pastor at KFCI, and I thought I didn't even
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.240]   get a chance to call all of my members.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.760]   And so all of that, of course, you know, I'm just telling you the human side of me.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.080]   And all of that just flashed by in like two seconds.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:11.400]   And at the same time, I believe it was the spirit of love that was speaking in my heart.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:20.240]   I looked at her more intensely as she was still talking, and I saw that God has put
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:27.400]   her in front of me at this time, in this moment, not someone else, but me.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:33.720]   And at the same time as I was looking at her, I felt that God loved her.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:40.400]   And I thought to myself, "If God loved her, and I'm his vessel because he has saved me
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:46.760]   from all my sins, shouldn't I be looking after her at this time?
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.560]   I mean, what is another 30 minutes to me?
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.800]   The next bus comes in 35 minutes, just FYI."
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.960]   And so after that struggle, I thought, "You know what?
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.000]   Forget about the bus, okay?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.520]   Be here, be present."
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.040]   And so I said, "Tell me more.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.320]   Tell me more what happened.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.320]   How are you feeling?
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.960]   How are they?"
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.000]   And so she told me about how they used to be at church, and then they would pass by
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.440]   each other, they would have these little conversations, and how shocking it was for her.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.240]   And so we chatted, and then we had a nice time to pray.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.400]   We prayed together.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.420]   We also prayed for that man's family, because they were non-Christians, and we're thinking
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.960]   about using a non-Christian type of memorial.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.720]   So we prayed for their families also to have that peace in this time, because it was so
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.280]   shocking.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.080]   And so we parted ways.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:58.520]   Before we parted, I gave her the coronavirus forbidden hug, and then we left, and I went
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:03.240]   to take the next bus that was just about to come.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.360]   And so when I got onto the bus, I was really thinking to myself, and I was praying at the
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.160]   same time, telling God, "Thank you.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:19.400]   Thank you for allowing me to be carrying her burden just a little bit.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.000]   Thank you for allowing me to be there."
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.320]   And then as I was just, you know, the bus taking off, I thought about that old man.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:39.720]   I thought about the old man, and I just thought, "Did nobody take notice of his sadness?
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.400]   Did nobody care about how he was doing?"
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:51.640]   Because he actually committed suicide at two in the afternoon.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   And I thought about that.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:33:00.520]   And I also thought, "Did he not develop any friendships in the small group that was deep
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:11.040]   enough and safe enough for him to call at that moment when he couldn't take it anymore?"
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:17.880]   And I just kept on thinking about the old man, and I thought, "What if somebody took
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.760]   notice of him?
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.360]   Would things have been different?
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:31.160]   What if somebody took an extra 15 minutes and sat with him?"
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.600]   And I thought, "Oh, were they all kind of like me, who was trying to catch the earlier
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.520]   bus and was in such a rush?
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.320]   Maybe they had to go home to cook for their kids.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.760]   Maybe they have to prepare their homework.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.080]   And maybe there were so many other things.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:58.360]   Maybe they were even preparing for next week's Sunday school materials."
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:05.400]   And so as we, as I was on the bus and going home, I really thought to myself, I thought
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.560]   that today I actually didn't write a sermon.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.920]   I actually got to live out a sermon.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:23.400]   And I realized I didn't do it at all, because in my flesh, I was going to catch that earlier
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.120]   bus.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:33.200]   But it was in the spirit that allowed me to partner with God in that moment to carry someone's
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.440]   burden.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.880]   Of course, I would always wonder if someone had carried that old man's burden, had spent
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:46.000]   an extra few minutes there, what would have happened?
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.560]   But nobody would know.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.880]   And so I really reflected thinking about all this, and I think that's fulfilling God's
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.320]   law when he says, "Bear each other's burden."
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.960]   Because I felt that on the day, God helped me to love her, which was somebody that was
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.600]   on God's heart.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:14.760]   And so today, my friends, I wanted to say that God's not asking us to do something very,
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.040]   very hard.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:22.880]   He's not asking us to part the Red Sea or to walk on water, but he is asking us to bear
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.840]   one another's burden.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.820]   And how can we do that?
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:32.960]   And for some of us, it might just be not catching this bus, but the next one, so that I can
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.240]   have an open ear and pray.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:41.020]   And for others, it might be that we'll all chip in, and then we'll help with some medical
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.320]   bills of someone.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:49.920]   And for others even more, it might just be giving that new person, that welcome of new
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.460]   people today, just welcoming that person.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:59.560]   Maybe they're going through some hard things too, and just saying, "Wait, what has been
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.160]   on your mind lately?"
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:08.560]   And that would have helped to carry one another's burden.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:18.260]   And so I just wanted to close today to say that God didn't meant for us to be alone.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:24.100]   He meant for us to be in a community, and our faith is not meant that God saved us so
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.100]   we can enjoy a comfortable...
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:31.980]   Well, we are very comfortable still, but not to only enjoy a comfortable Christian life,
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:39.220]   but he has asked us, has called us to be his vessels, because we have been broken before,
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.580]   and yet he has redeemed us.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:46.360]   And he's asking us to extend the same amount of love to others.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.640]   And we do wanna do that.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:57.740]   And so I don't know who's here or even watching our Facebook videos, maybe there's something
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.040]   on your heart that you're struggling with.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.780]   I just wanted to say that it's okay to tell us about it.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:11.940]   It's okay that we walk together and bear each other's burden, because we were meant to,
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.440]   God asked us to.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.020]   And so if that's you, please come and tell us.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:23.860]   And for us who are the ones that are able to bear others, let's stay alert, let's look
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   around.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:31.420]   I mean, not like a detective, okay, but really to pay attention, to see, has anybody, even
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.940]   though they've been coming to church every week, even though they seem to have a smiley
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.140]   face, what's happening with that person?
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:45.880]   Let us take initiative and go and really see how other people are doing.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:54.120]   And so I'm just praying that God is helping us along the way to do all these things, which
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.900]   is to bear one another's burden in his spirit, in the way that he would do it.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.400]   And at the same time, check our hearts all the time, and also for us to learn that we
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.200]   need one another.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:16.020]   And so we'll ask the worship band to come and we'll pray together, that really for us
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.900]   to know how we can serve our King, how we can be a vessel to him in different times
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.840]   of the day, in different ways that we might not even have thought of.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.720]   So let's pray together.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:37.460]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for saving us.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:45.140]   You have so many brokenness and weaknesses, and yet in Jesus, you have made us new, you
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.000]   have made us whole.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.260]   And Father, we thank you for this spiritual community that we have, that we can lean on
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.260]   one another.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.720]   We don't have to be by ourselves.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.980]   You have given us a spirit that lives inside of us, and you've also given people around
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.780]   us so that we can love one another, we can bear each other's burdens.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:14.020]   And Father, we're just praying that whenever you want us to be your vessel, that whenever
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:24.180]   you want us to have a pair of listening ears, or just to walk alongside with someone, or
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:29.660]   that we can pay for something that people need.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:35.660]   Father, whatever that may be, I pray that your spirit stirs in us, so that in the moment
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:41.060]   when you want to do something, Father, that we're right there to partner with you.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.300]   We know that this is a gift that you've given us.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:49.820]   It is a blessing that we're able to bear one another's burden.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:55.780]   And so Father, we thank you for this honor, and we thank you that you have saved us.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.500]   And this is the beginning of everything.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.660]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
