1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
早安!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
早安!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
昨天誰睡了八小時?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
舉手!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
八小時多於八小時的舉手!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
那麼厲害?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
哇!

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
OK!

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
七小時的舉手!

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
OK,Jetta!

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
六小時!

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
六小時,我也睡了六小時!

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
OK,五小時!

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
五小時那麼少?

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
五小時!

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
OK,Jetta!

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
五小時!五小時那麼少?

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
你叫T1去看球賽嗎?

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
OK!

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
四小時!

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
誰睡了四小時?

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
那麼少?

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
三小時,有沒有三小時的?

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
三小時?

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
為什麼Hillary睡了三小時?

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
睡不著嗎?

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
OK,兩個小時呢?

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
有沒有兩個小時?

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
一個小時?

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
沒有睡覺的?

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
為什麼你沒有睡覺?

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
很多事情要做?

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
是不是很多事情要做?

34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
好,我們今天繼續我們的系列是講「獨人的心」

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
上個星期,記不記得Gavin教主講了什麼話題?

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
什麼話題?有沒有人知道?

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
上個星期是關於什麼的?

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
是「葡萄園工人的祈禱」

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
是不是?

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
有些人是早上上班的

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
有些人是下午上班的

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
有些人是很晚才上班的

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
但是每個人都付出相同的工資

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
然後Gavin教主就給了我們三個應用程式

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
今天我們會繼續Matthew 20的詞語

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
我們一起讀Matthew 20

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
一起讀,1,2,3

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:19,000
(英文)

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:48,000
(英文)

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
好

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
有兩個兄弟

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
知不知道他們的名字?

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
一個叫John

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
一個叫James

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
他們就是主耶穌的什麼?

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
門徒

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
有時候他們的媽媽也會跟著一起

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
有一次他們的媽媽就求耶穌

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
求耶穌什麼?

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
求耶穌這個很特別的要求

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
有時候

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
我的經驗是有時候媽媽會逼你做一些事情

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
是不是?

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
對不起,Joyce阿姨

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
我記得我小時候

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
我在食物店

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
有沒有人跟媽媽去買菜?

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
買菜的時候排隊很長

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
媽媽就叫我先排隊

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
然後就有很多壓力

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
因為我沒有東西買

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
是我媽媽走來走去買東西

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
然後我在排隊

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
然後Next,Next

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
然後越近現金的時候

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
就越大壓力

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
因為我沒有東西買

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
然後我等我媽媽

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
媽媽過來

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
我下一

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
有沒有人被媽媽逼去排隊?

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
你試過嗎?

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
好,我沒有

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
為什麼只有男生?

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
女生也有

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
然後去到Cheer Lab沒有東西買

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
後面的人就看著你

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
為什麼你站在那裡?

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
你站在那裡幹什麼?

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
你先走

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
第二個你也先走

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
第三個你也先走

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
然後就有很多壓力

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
我就走了

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
然後我媽媽就說

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
為什麼你走了?

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
我現在又要排隊了

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
所以有時候

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
媽媽是很愛我們的

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
但有時候是逼我們做一些事情

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
我們覺得奇怪的

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
是不是?

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
對不起

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
我愛我的媽媽

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
我們都愛我們的媽媽

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
但有時候是做一些奇怪的事情

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
有時候將來Crystal也會這樣

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
所以這個媽媽

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
James和John的媽媽

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
就向耶穌求他一個很特別的要求

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
她認識主耶穌是誰?

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
她認識主耶穌是王

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
是主

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
她就求他

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
你讓我的兩個兒子

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
坐在你的右邊和你的左邊

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
坐在右邊和左邊是什麼意思?

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
有沒有人看過皇帝的影片?

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
平時誰坐在右邊和左邊?

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
誰坐的?

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
是不是很低級的人?

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
是否那個Joker?

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
跳舞那個?

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
不是,是和王子最接近的人

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
是不是?

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
或者是在線的

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
可能是王子

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
王子或王后

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
所以坐在耶穌的右邊和左邊

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
是代表三樣東西

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
第一,接近

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
和皇帝

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
接近

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
和皇帝

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
或神

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
第二,是權力

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
坐在右邊和左邊

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
意味著你有某種權力

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
可能你向皇帝說話

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
你告訴他們你的建議

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
或許你坐在線的

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
這意味著榮譽

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
你和皇帝

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
你和榮譽

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
你有高的位置

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
耶穌聽到他媽媽這樣說

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
這個媽媽的要求

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
他就怎樣回應?

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
他就說,你能喝這杯嗎?

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
你能喝這杯嗎?

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
我正要喝的那杯嗎?

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
我不能喝的那杯嗎?

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
他為什麼這樣回應?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
你覺得他

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
他在說什麼?

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
面對迫害

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
面對迫害

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
OK

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
差不多了

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
你能夠承擔這個責任嗎?

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
負責任

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
是不是?

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
我正要承擔的責任

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
耶穌有什麼負責任?

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
耶穌就這樣說

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
你不知道自己在要求什麼

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
你能喝我正要喝的那杯嗎?

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
他們對他說,我們能喝

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
John和James可能馬上回答

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
我們可以的

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
我們能喝

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
好像一個NBA隊伍

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
你需要承擔

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
好像Coby Bryant

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
你需要承擔這個隊伍

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
你能承擔這個隊伍嗎?

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
有沒有人覺得他是承擔他們的運動隊伍?

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
是嗎?

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
你承擔什麼隊伍?

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
CY你承擔什麼隊伍?

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
水上運動嗎?

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
你承擔Kaleb嗎?

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
OK

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
耶穌就說,你能承擔這個隊伍嗎?

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
好像籃球隊

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Coby Bryant承擔這個隊伍

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
在第四季

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
要完成比賽的時候

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
他要求球

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
然後他就拿到比賽的獎牌

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
但入不到

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
誰負責任?

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
也是他負責任

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
他能夠承擔責任

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
耶穌就問John和James

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
你能不能承擔這個球?

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
耶穌是什麼?

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
是一個僕人

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
他洗門徒的腳

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
還有他有什麼負責任?

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
他是釘十字架

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
為整個世界的罪去死

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
他在領圓之上死了

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
他的手上的指甲

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
他的頭上的鑽石的銅像

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
他承擔了世界的責任

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
他帶領了世界

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
耶穌就說

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
你會喝這個杯,我的杯

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
你會喝我的杯

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
你知不知道James和John之後

212
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
耶穌死了,復活的時候

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
之後他做了什麼?

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
他繼續宣教

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
我們看James

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
James was the first martyr

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's read Acts chapter 12 together

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
1,2,3

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
About that time

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hurid the king laid violent hands

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
on some who belonged to the church

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He killed James the brother of John

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
with the sword

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And when he saw that it pleased the Jews

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He proceeded to arrest Peter also

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
在Acts chapter 12這裡

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
我們看到Hurid殺死了James

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He did drink the blood of the Jews

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He did drink the cup that Jesus gave him

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He took responsibility

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
for the things Jesus passed on to him

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
to share the gospel to the nations

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He died

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This is an artistic drawing

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
painting of him

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
John呢

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
有沒有人知道John繼續怎樣

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
他寫了很多書

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
我們看

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
他寫了Gospel of John

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
1st John, 2nd John, 3rd John

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
還有他寫了Revelations

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
知不知道他在哪裡寫Revelations

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
是不是在一個Palace

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
很美的Palace

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Sea view

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
很多servant給他食物

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
喝東西

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
他就可以很享受

250
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
去寫Revelations

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
是不是

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
不是

253
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
知不知道他在哪裡

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
他在prison

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
這是一個Picture

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
是一個prison

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
他是在一個Cave

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Patmos

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
有沒有人去過Patmos

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Greece

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
沒有去過

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
你去Patmos就可以看到這個教會

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
這個教會是一個

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Remembrance of John

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How he was sent to prison

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
on this island

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to live in a cave

268
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He didn't die for Jesus

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
but he was definitely persecuted for Jesus

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
最後

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
耶穌說

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But to sit at my right hand and to my left

273
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It is not for me to grant

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
是誰去給的

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
這個是天父

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
我們看到這裡

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
耶穌去謙卑他自己

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He obeys the Father

279
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not for him

280
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
他surrender了他的authority

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to obey the Father

282
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
那麼門徒聽到John和James的媽媽的Request

283
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
你覺得他們的反應會怎樣

284
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
門徒的反應會怎樣

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
是不是說

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
好啊好啊

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
讓他們坐吧

288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
他們這麼好的兄弟

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
是不是

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
當然不是

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
會有一點Jealousy

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
是不是

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
有一點Jealousy

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's read together

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Verse 24

296
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
我們一起讀

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Ready

298
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
1 2 3

299
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And when the ten heard it

300
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
they were indignant at the two brothers

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But Jesus called them to him and said

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them

303
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and their great ones exercise authority over them

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It shall not be so among you

305
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But whoever would be great among you

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
must be your servant

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And whoever would be first among you

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
must be your slave

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Even as the Son of Man came not to be served

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
but to serve and to give his life

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
as a ransom for many

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
門徒很Jealous

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
是不是

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Jealous

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Indignant

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
是不是

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
搞錯啊

318
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
這兩個媽媽的Request

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
搞錯啊

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
是不是

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
但耶穌給我們有三點去學

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
學點是可以有一個Servant Leader

323
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
我們怎樣做一個Servant Leader

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
第一

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Servant Leader is counter-cultural

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Counter-cultural

327
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
耶穌就說

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
這些世界的Ruler

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
是不是

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
會Exercise他們的Authority

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But not so among you

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
耶穌的Teaching

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
是和世界的Teaching不同的

334
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's different

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
OK

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Jesus is challenging the disciples

337
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to think differently

338
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
我們這個世界是看Prosperity

339
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Power

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Prestige

341
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
你怎樣做領袖

342
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
你有Prosperity

343
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
你有Power

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
你有Prestige

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
人家就看起你

346
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
你就可以做領袖

347
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
是不是

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
你做學生

349
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
怎樣找領袖

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How do you find a leader

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
你看他去哪間學校

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh they go to HKU

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They must be smart

354
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
你看他去哪間學校

355
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
你看他們的成績是多少

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh this guy gets top of the school

357
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
是不是

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
他應該做領袖

359
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
或者他Popularity

360
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
他Instagram有多少Followers

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
They post so many things on Instagram

362
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
是不是

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
這麼多人Follow

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
應該做領袖

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
是不是

366
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
或者他們的Status

367
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Maybe their parents are rich

368
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Maybe they wear expensive things

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And so they have a specific status

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
他好像很厲害

371
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
很有錢

372
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
他應該做領袖

373
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
或者他們的Talent很厲害

374
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
是不是

375
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
很有口才

376
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
或者很多不同的Skills

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
打球很厲害

378
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Maybe they should be the leader

379
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
of our team

380
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
of our school

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Valedictorian

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
這個世界是找什麼Leadership qualities

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
我們看下一個Slide

384
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Leadership qualities

385
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Are they inspirational

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Are they honest

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Highly committed

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
誰覺得他們是Inspirational

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
CY?

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
想來Inspire我們嗎

391
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I wanna be inspired

392
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
你不是Leader

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
在學

394
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
誰覺得他是很Honest

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hillary, very good

396
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Trust the lawyer

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Trust the lawyer

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Highly committed

399
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
誰覺得他是Highly committed

400
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
他做事是Committed了

401
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
沒有人

402
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
OK

403
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Passionate

404
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Who thinks they are passionate as a leader

405
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah, passionate

406
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Reflective and decisive

407
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
做領袖是要做決定的

408
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Who thinks that they are decisive

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
舉手

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
有沒有人

411
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
不Decisive

412
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
全部是Procrastinator

413
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
哈哈

414
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
選食物

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
選一個小時的

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
午餐的時候

417
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Reflective, creative

418
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
誰覺得他是Problem solver

419
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
舉手

420
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Problem solver

421
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
是不是沒有Problem

422
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
所以不用Solve Problem

423
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Hillary,有嗎

424
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
OK

425
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
這個是Problem maker

426
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
哈哈

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hillary說他令到Problem更差

428
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
可能是Problem creator

429
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
OK

430
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
這個世界是看很多不同的東西

431
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
但耶穌在找什麼

432
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
領袖是什麼

433
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
領袖的僕人的心

434
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
OK

435
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He is looking for a servant heart

436
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But whoever

437
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's see the next slide

438
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But whoever would be great among you

439
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Must be your servant

440
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And whoever would be first among you

441
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Must be your slave

442
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
你想最勁

443
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
你想坐在我的右邊和左邊

444
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
你想怎樣

445
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
你要怎樣

446
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
你要做一個僕人

447
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You need to be a servant

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
誰喜歡做僕人

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
誰喜歡吃飯的時候

450
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
幫人拿飯

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
主動幫人拿飯

452
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
這麼乖

453
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
OK, very good

454
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
我過來吃飯

455
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
OK

456
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
誰喜歡

457
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
誰很幫忙媽媽拿東西

458
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
OK

459
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
真的這麼乖

460
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
OK

461
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
誰在學校很幫人

462
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
有servant heart的

463
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
有沒有人

464
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Kaleb, what do you do

465
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What do you do, Caleb

466
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He is helpful

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
你幫Mark做功課

468
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
這個不是好評

469
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Something else

470
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
耶穌的quality of a leader

471
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
是什麼

472
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
是一個servant

473
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Our action is to serve

474
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Our commitment is to serve

475
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
好像我們現在form了很多不同的team

476
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
是不是

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
有多少個team

478
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
有個,誰是buddy team的

479
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
舉手,buddy team

480
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OK

481
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
還有誰

482
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
還有什麼team

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
outreach team

484
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OK,誰是outreach team的

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
舉手

486
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
CY,你什麼team都是

487
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
那個team都是

488
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
好像下一個slide

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
有個outreach team的

490
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
還有什麼team

491
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
還有什麼team

492
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
沒有team了

493
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
ambassador team

494
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
舉手

495
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
誰是ambassador team

496
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
又是CY

497
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
CY is every team

498
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
CY will carry us

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
還有什麼team

500
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
worship team

501
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
舉手,worship team

502
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
是不是

503
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
worship team

504
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
還有什麼

505
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Mark你剛才說什麼

506
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
swimming team

507
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
OK,有個sports team

508
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
誰是sport team

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
是不是叫sport team

510
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
還是running team

511
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
sport team

512
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
誰是sport team

513
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
CY是不是

514
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
不是

515
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
OK,Josea

516
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
OK,very good

517
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
有這麼多個team

518
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
你做個領袖

519
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
神是在看什麼

520
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
神是在看你是不是有一個僕人入心

521
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
servant heart

522
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
不是看到你多威風,多厲害

523
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
是看到你是不是欠給你自己

524
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
去serve

525
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
為什麼我們要serve

526
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
因為我們有一個example

527
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
那個example是誰

528
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
那個example是誰

529
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
是不是CY

530
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
CY也是一個good example

531
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
這麼有心去侍奉

532
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
但最好的example是Juye

533
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So let's look at the next slide

534
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Even as the son of man came not to be served

535
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but to serve

536
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and to give his life as a ransom for many

537
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
為什麼我們如果想做領袖

538
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
要做僕人

539
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
因為主耶穌也是僕人

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He did not come to be served

541
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
他是皇帝來的

542
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
是不是

543
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He came from heaven

544
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
他是皇帝來的

545
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
我們是應該serve他

546
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
但他們怎樣

547
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
他怎樣

548
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
他serve那些門徒

549
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
他怎樣serve那些門徒

550
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
他洗他的腳

551
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
是不是

552
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
你的腳乾不乾淨

553
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
乾不乾淨

554
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
乾不乾淨

555
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
你的腳乾不乾淨

556
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
誰想洗我的腳

557
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
我打完球給你洗好不好

558
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
誰想的

559
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
你沒有僕人的心

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
學不到東西

561
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
他們以前走路

562
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
用sandals

563
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
好像有些pavement走路

564
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
路很乾淨

565
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
不是的

566
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
可能有馬糞

567
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
有泥

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
有什麼

569
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
誰踩過東西

570
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
舉手

571
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
踩過糞便

572
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
是不是

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
好不好玩

574
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
可能臭的

575
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
可能很滑的

576
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
可能滑的

577
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
然後給耶穌洗

578
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
這些路什麼都有

579
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
不知道

580
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
沒有人掃地

581
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
好像那些government workers

582
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
天天洗路

583
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
很乾淨

584
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
但是耶穌那時代

585
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We don't know what was on that road

586
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
但他怎樣

587
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
他肯去洗門徒的腳

588
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He was willing

589
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
還有怎樣

590
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He gave up his life

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He gave up his life for us

592
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
他怎樣死

593
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
是不是一個很magnificent hero death

594
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
他好像Lord of the Rings

595
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
他defeat了那個enemy

596
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
很victorious

597
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
一個hero death

598
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
其實不是

599
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
這個是最醜樣的一個方法去死

600
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
To be stripped naked

601
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
To be nailed on the cross

602
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
他被人笑

603
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
你是皇帝

604
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I give a crown of thorns to you

605
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He was humiliated

606
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
他是最low的一個death

607
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
To be hung on a cross

608
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It was humiliation

609
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
他做一個皇帝

610
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
他願意去為我們死

611
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
所以我們怎樣做一個領袖

612
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
我們是要做一個僕人

613
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
我們的思想是要不同的

614
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
耶穌教的東西是和世界不同的

615
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's counter cultural

616
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
這個世界是看我們的appearance

617
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
神看什麼

618
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
神看我們的

619
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Man looks in appearance

620
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
God looks at the heart

621
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
神看到你的心

622
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
神看到你的思想

623
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
第二個C是commitment

624
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
to servanthood

625
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
我們的action

626
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
我們願不願意去侍奉人

627
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
幫人

628
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
做一些事情可能覺得不是很high

629
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
in the world

630
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
但神看到什麼

631
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
神看到我們的心

632
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
第三我們願不願意

633
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
去跟隨耶穌的example

634
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Are we willing to follow God's example

635
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He died on the cross for us

636
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He washed the disciples' feet

637
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He is here to serve

638
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
我們請worship team上來

639
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
我們不如閉上眼

640
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
We are going to take some time to just reflect

641
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Has God called you to be a servant

642
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And if He has called you to be a servant

643
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Are you willing

644
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
你願不願意去侍奉神

645
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
去幫人

646
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
愛神

647
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
愛人

648
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Are you willing to be a servant leader

649
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
謙卑自己

650
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
轉我們的thinking

651
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
不是好像世界那樣想

652
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
我們現在開始轉我們的thinking

653
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
去相信主耶穌

654
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And follow what He has called us to do

655
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
最後我們願不願意去跟隨耶穌的example

656
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
不是跟隨世界

657
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
是跟隨主耶穌

658
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
我們請一會去reflect

659
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
between you and the Lord

660
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
(音樂)

661
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
(音樂)

662
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
(音樂)

663
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:58,000
(音樂)

664
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Dear Heavenly Father

665
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
We thank you for Jesus

666
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Who left His throne in heaven

667
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
To come down

668
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Not to be served

669
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But to serve us

670
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And ultimately to die on the cross for us

671
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Help us Lord to become more like you

672
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
To love those around us

673
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
To love the poor

674
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Love the needy

675
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
To value the things that you value

676
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
To do the things you called us to do

677
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
To live selflessly

678
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Rather than selfishly

679
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Help us Lord to be your servant

680
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
In this dark world

681
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
To be your light

682
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
To be a city on a hill

683
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
In Jesus name we pray

684
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Amen

685
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
我們一起起來
