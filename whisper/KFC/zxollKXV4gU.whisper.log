[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]  (字幕製作:貝爾)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.600]  大家好,早安
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.200]  我們繼續我們的系列
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.880]  《羅曼福音書》
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.040]  有沒有人記得我們
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.240]  到目前為止
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.080]  羅曼福音書說了什麼?
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.080]  大聲說出來
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.840]  (Abraham)
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.440]  Abraham,還有呢?
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.440]  還有說了什麼?
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.840]  《羅曼福音書》
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.520]  記不記得?大聲說出來
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.520]  不要只是Gabe說,好嗎?
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.040]  記不記得說了什麼題目?
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.640]  有什麼主題在《羅曼福音書》?
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640]  沒有人記得?
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.640]  沒有人記得?
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.640]  我給你一些答案
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.640]  下一頁
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.640]  "Save by faith"
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640]  我們是用什麼去
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.440]  有盼望的?
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.440]  是用信心,是嗎?
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720]  "Is it by works"
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.520]  我們做很多事,然後我們就
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.120]  會被救活,是嗎?
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.120]  不是,是用信心
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.520]  我們信心得救了
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.520]  我們就有"Reconciliation with Christ"
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520]  我們和神的關係
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520]  就有平安
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.120]  We have peace with God, reconciliation
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.120]  然後我們就和神
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120]  有一個好關係
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.120]  祂就看到我們
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120]  為何祂看到我們
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120]  是righteous?
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.120]  Why does He see us as righteous?
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.120]  我們看下一頁
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120]  是一個圖片
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.120]  這個圖片是神的角度
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120]  神的角度看到我們
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.120]  祂看到什麼?
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120]  如果我們是用信心去
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.120]  去決了志
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.120]  神看到什麼?
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120]  神看到我們的罪嗎?
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.120]  祂知道我們有罪
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.120]  但是我們用信心
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.120]  接受了主耶穌
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.120]  主耶穌呢
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120]  神就看到主耶穌
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.120]  主耶穌是righteous
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120]  Jesus is righteous
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120]  And we still have sin
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120]  Right?
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.120]  We may still sin
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120]  But if we trust in Jesus
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120]  He is the one that will save us
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120]  So it says here
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120]  Simultaneously justified and sinful
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.120]  Ok?
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.120]  因為在我們的身體
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.120]  我們會
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.120]  Only in heaven
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.120]  will we have no more sin
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.120]  Ok,我們今天會有
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120]  四個不同的topic
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120]  As we discuss Romans chapter 6
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.120]  The first is dead to sin
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120]  Alive in Christ
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120]  Slaves to something
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.120]  And slaves to righteousness
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120]  Ok,我要你幫我們
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120]  讀一些經文
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120]  Ok,第四節
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.120]  我們一起讀中文好嗎?
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120]  你讀給我聽,1,2,3
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:15.120]  (教會的教師在教會的教會)
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.120]  繼續,next slide
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:29.120]  (教會的教師在教會的教會)
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.120]  Ok,第六章開始
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.120]  就是說我們以前
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120]  Our sinful nature
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.120]  was buried with Christ
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120]  was buried with Christ
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.120]  我們浸禮的時候
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.120]  為什麼要浸下水?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.120]  誰曾經浸禮?
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120]  舉手,ok
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120]  為什麼你們要浸下水?
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.120]  代表什麼?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120]  代表復活?
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.120]  是,同死同復活
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.120]  那我們下水的時候
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120]  代表我們的舊生
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.120]  Our sin is buried with Christ
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.120]  保羅就是這樣說
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.120]  Our old life is buried with Christ
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.120]  還有呢
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.120]  我們的舊生
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.120]  Is crucified with Christ
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.120]  Ok,我們的sinful life
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120]  Is crucified with Christ
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.120]  我記得我以前讀高中的時候
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.120]  Form 3,4,5
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.120]  3,4,5
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.120]  快要高中入大學了
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120]  我就發現了
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.120]  其實大學呢
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.120]  不看9,10和11的
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120]  平時不看的
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.120]  你們現在香港的大學
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]  看不看的?
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.120]  Grade,只是看Senior year
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120]  是不是?
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120]  DSE的year
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.120]  我聽到
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.120]  嘩!原來大學不看9,10和11的
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120]  我之前那些
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.120]  有些課不是考得很好
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.120]  嘩!Ok,好像
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.120]  Record清理了
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120]  他們不會看的
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120]  我記得我以前最差的課
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.120]  是Computer Science
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.120]  誰喜歡programming?
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120]  誰喜歡programming?
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120]  很喜歡programming
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.120]  我做programming呢
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.120]  你們會programming嗎?
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120]  誰厲害?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120]  不懂?
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.120]  Timon最會?
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.120]  下次我們叫Timon
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.120]  Create一個explorer app
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120]  好嗎?
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120]  不懂?
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.120]  Ok,裝不懂這個
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.120]  經常裝不懂
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.120]  我記得Computer Science
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.120]  嘩!我覺得不錯
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.120]  可以學一下Computer Science
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.120]  然後要做programming
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120]  那些language
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]  我都不明白
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120]  我都不懂
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.120]  I don't know what's going on
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.120]  那你有沒有人take a programming course?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120]  Computer Science
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.120]  Ok,Uncle Paul
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.120]  兩個,兩個
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.120]  那平時你不懂怎麼做program
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.120]  那你會怎樣?
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.120]  你平時上學不懂怎麼做
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.120]  那你會怎樣?
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.120]  問tutor
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.120]  問老師
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.120]  那我去老師那邊
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.120]  問他這個program不行
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.120]  為什麼經常有這麼多error
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.120]  你知不知道這些programming老師
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.120]  平時會怎樣?
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120]  他會叫你
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.120]  你自己figure it out
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.120]  You go figure it out
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.120]  那我就說,嘩!我不懂
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.120]  I don't even know what's going on
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.120]  我不懂邏輯
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.120]  是吧?
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.120]  但我這個科可能只是六十幾分
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.120]  最低的了
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.120]  但我聽到
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.120]  大學不會看這些分數
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.120]  我就覺得,嘩!好relief
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.120]  是吧?
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.120]  這個record是clean了
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.120]  保羅就是跟我們這樣說
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.120]  如果我們信靠主耶穌
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.120]  我們之前
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.120]  our sinful past
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.120]  我們好像浸泥的時候
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.120]  浸了下水
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.120]  our sins are washed away
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.120]  我們好像主耶穌釘十字架的時候
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.120]  our sins have died and been crucified
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.120]  on the cross with Christ
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]  第一個點就是
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.120]  dead to sin
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.120]  we are dead to sin
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.120]  because of what Jesus has done
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.120]  好,我們繼續讀
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120]  Romans chapter 6
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.120]  我們這次讀一下英文
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120]  我陪你讀
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]  OK, let's read together
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.120]  1,2,3,第八節
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.120]  Now, if we have died with Christ
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.120]  we believe that we will also live with Him
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:53.120]  繼續
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:09.120]  (英文)
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.120]  好,這裡繼續
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.120]  保羅就說
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]  我們
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.120]  we died with Christ
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]  right?
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120]  but now we have 什麼?
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.120]  我們現在有什麼?
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.120]  we rise with Christ
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.120]  我們有個新的生命
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.120]  we have a new life in Christ
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.120]  耶穌
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.120]  died for sin once and for all
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.120]  once and for all
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120]  and so now
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.120]  we are alive in Christ
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.120]  alive in Christ
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.120]  the next slide shows
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.120]  Jesus canceled our debt on the cross
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.120]  once and for all
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.120]  canceled our debt
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.120]  canceled our debt
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.120]  and so now
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.120]  we have freedom
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.120]  we have freedom in Christ
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.120]  we have freedom in Christ
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.120]  好像DSE那一年
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.120]  之前form 3 to form 5
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.120]  那個紀錄
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.120]  OK,你可能做的課不是那麼好
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120]  考得不是那麼好
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.120]  但現在DSE這個新年
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.120]  好像一個new opportunity
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.120]  一個fresh start
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.120]  fresh start
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.120]  誰讀DSE的現在?
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.120]  是不是好像一個fresh start?
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.120]  不是
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120]  是不是好像
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.120]  Vienna是不是好像一個fresh start?
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.120]  不是
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.120]  OK
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.120]  我以前就覺得
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.120]  哇,grade 12
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120]  一個fresh start
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.120]  是不是?
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.120]  一個clean slate
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.120]  一個新的開始
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.120]  a new year
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.120]  之前的那些past
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]  不要緊
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.120]  可能programming考得不好
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]  不要緊
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.120]  這個DSE那一年
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.120]  我這個grade 12那一年
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.120]  I have a fresh start
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.120]  我們繼續看Romans 6:16
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.120]  Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.120]  you are slaves of the one you obey,
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.120]  whether you are slaves to sin,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.120]  which leads to death,
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.120]  or obedience,
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.120]  which leads to righteousness.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.120]  But thanks be to God that you used to be slaves to sin.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.120]  You now have come to obey your heart,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.120]  the pattern of your teaching,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.120]  that has now claimed your allegiance.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.120]  保羅就說OK
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.120]  我們死了
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.120]  同神再死了
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.120]  We died to sin with Christ
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.120]  然後我們現在
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.120]  raised with Christ
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.120]  We are raised with Christ
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120]  We are alive in Christ
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.120]  然後怎樣呢?
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.120]  保羅就跟我們說
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.120]  We are all slaves to something
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.120]  We are all slaves to something
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.120]  你覺得你
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.120]  You are a slave to what?
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.120]  你覺得你是slave to甚麼?
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.120]  是不是slave to
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.120]  整天看Facebook,
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.120]  看Instagram,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.120]  看電話,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]  是不是?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.120]  整天看,好像做個slave一樣
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.120]  是不是?
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120]  好像
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.120]  好像有幾個
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.120]  是不是?
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.120]  控制不了
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]  好像slave一樣
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120]  是不是?
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]  有沒有?
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.120]  有些人可能是slave to錢的
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.120]  是不是?很喜歡錢
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120]  整天追求錢
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.120]  The Bible says
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.120]  you can only serve God or money
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.120]  You can't have two masters
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.120]  Two masters
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.120]  保羅就說
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.120]  我們每個人都是slave to something
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.120]  要不我們slave to sin
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.120]  slave to sin
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.120]  leads to death
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.120]  我們slave to righteousness
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.120]  and obedience
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.120]  那就是會跟隨神
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.120]  OK,你和你旁邊那個分享一下
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.120]  你覺得你是slave to甚麼?
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120]  是不是?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.120]  slave to甚麼?
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.120]  我們現在不會用這個term slave
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.120]  是不是?
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.120]  slave好像沒有control,沒有power
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.120]  因為你們millennials覺得
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.120]  我有freedom,我可以做甚麼都可以
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.120]  可以賺多少錢都可以
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.120]  society can't tell me what to do
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.120]  這個word slave好像很bind我們
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.120]  但保羅就是這樣說
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.120]  We are all slaves to something
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.120]  OK,和你旁邊說一下
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.120]  你覺得你是slave to甚麼?
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:21.120]  (掌聲鼓勵)
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.120]  OK,分享一下你們的組
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.120]  說了甚麼?
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.120]  有甚麼?slave to甚麼?
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.120]  那個group很好笑
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.120]  有甚麼要談?有甚麼要分享?
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.120]  有沒有?
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.120]  沒有?Timon有沒有?
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.120]  分享甚麼?
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.120]  秘密!
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.120]  OK,slaves to our secrets
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.120]  That's a good one
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.120]  OK,繼續吧
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.120]  Aaron那組又分享了甚麼?
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.120]  mobile phone
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.120]  誰是mobile phone的?舉手
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.120]  沒有人承認
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.120]  Clement也不承認?
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.120]  (笑)
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.120]  好,Winnie那組呢?
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.120]  有沒有?
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.120]  甚麼?
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.120]  procrastination
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.120]  我聽到不知道是甚麼
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.120]  procrastination
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.120]  誰是procrastination?
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.120]  OK,Winnie
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.120]  還有這個女生
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.120]  還有呢?Jason那組呢?
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.120]  談了甚麼?
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120]  YouTube
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.120]  OK,誰是slave to YouTube?
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.120]  繼續看
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.120]  哇,繼續看
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.120]  Suggestion after suggestion
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.120]  繼續看
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.120]  看到天亮也行
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120]  誰是?
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.120]  一個slave to YouTube
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.120]  OK,只有Clement承認
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.120]  為甚麼你們不承認?
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.120]  Pastor Paul那組呢?
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120]  不是Pastor Paul
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.120]  Uncle Paul
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.120]  Laziness
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120]  Laziness
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.120]  誰是Laziness?
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.120]  Slave to Laziness
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.120]  哇,多些人承認了
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120]  OK,Tim也是
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]  Timon也是
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.120]  這是你的秘密嗎?Timon
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.120]  (他們的秘密)
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.120]  哦,他們的秘密
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.120]  OK,OK
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.120]  OK,我們每一個都是
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120]  a slave to something
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120]  是嗎?
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.120]  好像
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.120]  你們讀完DSE
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120]  會去哪裏?
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120]  平時會去哪裏?
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.120]  入大學吧,是嗎?
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120]  入了大學呢?
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.120]  我記得我第一年
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.120]  我記得我去哪個大學嗎?
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]  記得嗎?
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.120]  有人記得嗎?
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.120]  Yes
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.120]  OK,Karen知道了
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.120]  University of Toronto

[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120]  不是沒有學生
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.120]  沒有老師管著我嗎?
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.120]  為甚麼沒有老師
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.120]  為甚麼不說我遲到呢?
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.120]  為甚麼沒有人問我
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.120]  有沒有做功課呢?
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.120]  很有freedom
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120]  入了大學
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.120]  你們覺得入了大學很有freedom嗎?
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.120]  很有freedom
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.120]  我們入了大學
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120]  很有freedom
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.120]  沒有人管著我們
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.120]  我們要自己
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120]  choose
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.120]  有選擇
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.120]  那你猜我選擇去讀書呢?
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.120]  很勤力
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.120]  每天去library找書
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.120]  跟朋友group study
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.120]  還是我
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.120]  很懶
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.120]  又上課時睡覺
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.120]  然後又去打球
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120]  繼續讀球
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.120]  你猜我
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.120]  很勤力讀書呢?
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.120]  還是
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.120]  很勤力打球
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.120]  你猜我選擇甚麼呢?
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.120]  很勤力讀書的舉手
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.120]  哇,Esther對我很有信心
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.120]  我的成績很厲害
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.120]  誰猜我
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.120]  很勤力打球的舉手
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.120]  ok,good
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120]  我一開始呢
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.120]  就很有freedom
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.120]  去到大學沒有人管著我
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.120]  沒有人take my attendance
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.120]  那就去打球
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120]  是不是?
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.120]  早上打到晚上
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.120]  整天都打的

[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.120]  整天都打的
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.120]  保羅就說我們
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.120]  有選擇
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.120]  我們可以選擇
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120]  去犯罪
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.120]  或者選擇
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.120]  去跟隨神
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.120]  我們讀完final一個節
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.120]  幾節
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.120]  我一會兒說
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.120]  ok,let's read together
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.120]  讀中文好嗎?
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]  幫我讀
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120]  1,2,3
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.120]  19節
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:18:01.120]  繼續
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:18.120]  (中文)
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.120]  ok,我幫你讀完它
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.120]  Verse 22
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:28.120]  (中文)
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:44.120]  (中文)
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]  保羅就說
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.120]  我們的選擇
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]  是有什麼?
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.120]  有後果的
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]  我們的選擇
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.120]  是有後果的
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.120]  如果我們跟隨
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.120]  罪呢?
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.120]  結果是什麼?
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.120]  Shame and death
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.120]  Shame and death
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.120]  我們選擇犯罪的時候
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]  我們就會有
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.120]  Shame and eventually
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.120]  Spiritual death
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.120]  但是我們跟隨神
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.120]  如果我們是slaves to righteousness
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.120]  我們有什麼?
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.120]  Holiness
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.120]  Holiness and eternal life
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.120]  Holiness and eternal life
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.120]  那我
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.120]  在大學的時候
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.120]  是不是?
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.120]  經常打球
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.120]  我們經常打球
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.120]  那就慢慢
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.120]  keep up不到我們的course
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]  因為大學
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.120]  你可以在high school
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.120]  一晚procrastinate
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.120]  然後明天
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.120]  ace the test都可以
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.120]  但是大學可以嗎?
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120]  大學的material
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.120]  可能是幾倍
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.120]  所以不可以
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.120]  material那麼多
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.120]  所以慢慢
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.120]  keep up不到
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.120]  keep up不到
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.120]  我的first year
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.120]  開始的時候就讀得不好
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.120]  然後我就反省
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.120]  我不可以
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.120]  我不可以進了大學
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.120]  第一年
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.120]  然後失敗
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.120]  是不是?
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.120]  我爸媽
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.120]  我怎麼跟爸媽說
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]  我失敗了這課程
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120]  搞錯
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.120]  我是一個
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.120]  很independent的person
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.120]  是不是?
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.120]  那我就
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.120]  考試之前
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.120]  我記得考試之前
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120]  我就祈禱
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]  阿神啊
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120]  求你幫我
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.120]  我不喜歡讀書的
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.120]  但是你幫我
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.120]  讓我有能力
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.120]  去用心去讀書
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.120]  那我就
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.120]  幾個星期
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.120]  每天都study
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.120]  差不多十幾個小時
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.120]  I study for like ten hours a day
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.120]  for a couple weeks
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.120]  因為我考試的時候
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.120]  一定要pass
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120]  要做得好
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.120]  然後才可以pass到
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.120]  個course
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.120]  We all have a choice
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.120]  We all have a choice
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.120]  我們現在邀請Clement上來
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.120]  他會講他自己的見證
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.120]  我們給他掌聲
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:36.120]  Hello, I'm Clement
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.120]  I'm 14 and I study in Harrow
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.120]  I've been in Korkfork Church for about 6 years now
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.120]  I'm here to talk about how I became a Christian
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.120]  My friend brought me to church
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120]  When I first joined
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.120]  I thought that was pretty pointless
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.120]  and I didn't really want to come
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.120]  I didn't know anything about God or the Bible
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.120]  I would easily be distracted
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.120]  and was only seeking entertainment for myself
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.120]  like YouTube, Discord and gaming
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.120]  After going to church more
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.120]  and learning from my mentors like Johnny
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.120]  and reading the Bible
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.120]  I started to understand it more
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.120]  I always felt God's powerful spirit
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.120]  when I read the Bible or pray
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.120]  That's how I believed in God
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.120]  I also had a better connection with Him
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.120]  and had more faith in Him
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120]  and trusted Him even more
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.120]  and knew that He would provide me with more strength
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.120]  When Satan tried to tempt me
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.120]  I prayed to God and asked Him for help
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.120]  and peacefulness and calm
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.120]  which changed my behavior
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.120]  and my mindset and my actions
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.120]  Thanks for listening
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.120]  (掌聲)
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.120]  Oh, thank you Clement
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.120]  他之前只顧著YouTube, Discord
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120]  是吧?
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.120]  之後認識了神
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.120]  他的生命就改變了
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.120]  是吧?他的desire是改變了
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.120]  之前是想追求自己的desire
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.120]  認識了神就開始追求神
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.120]  追求我們的desire
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.120]  我們回顧第一
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.120]  我們回顧第一
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.120]  We are dead to sin
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.120]  如果我們有信心
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.120]  缺了志
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.120]  We are dead to sin
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.120]  Jesus died for our sin once and for all
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.120]  And now we rise with Christ
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.120]  We are alive with Christ
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.120]  我們有自由
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.120]  We have freedom
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.120]  And once we have freedom
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.120]  We have choice
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.120]  我們有選擇
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.120]  我們可以跟隨主耶穌
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.120]  或者跟隨罪
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.120]  接著保羅就告訴我們後果
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.120]  如果我們跟隨罪
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.120]  後果就是死亡
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.120]  Death and shame
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.120]  如果我們跟隨主耶穌
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.120]  是有eternal life and holiness
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.120]  eternal life and holiness
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.120]  我們每天
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.120]  你覺得你每天
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.120]  做多少個選擇
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.120]  Make多少個決定
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.120]  你每天
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.120]  會不會100個決定
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.120]  100個選擇
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.120]  有什麼選擇
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.120]  你起床
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.120]  警鈴開始的時候
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.120]  是不是
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.120]  繼續睡還是起床
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.120]  接著回教會還是繼續睡
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.120]  早餐吃不吃
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.120]  回來教會有什麼選擇
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.120]  跟誰坐
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.120]  是不是
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.120]  接著來到這裡
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.120]  有什麼選擇
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.120]  聽不聽
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.120]  聽不聽到
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.120]  還是玩手機
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.120]  是不是
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120]  之後睡不睡
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120]  接著吃午餐
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120]  吃不吃午餐
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]  很多選擇
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.120]  每天我們有很多選擇
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.120]  可能500個
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.120]  1000個選擇
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.120]  我們怎麼做選擇
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.120]  會讓主耶穌高興
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.120]  我們會成為正義的奴隸
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.120]  有句話說
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.120]  如果我們選擇去犯罪
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.120]  我們會選擇去受苦
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.120]  如果我們選擇去犯罪
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.120]  我們會選擇去受苦
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.120]  後果可能不是馬上的
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.120]  可能慢慢才能顯現
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.120]  或者永遠才能顯現
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.120]  有些罪
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.120]  但如果我們選擇去犯罪
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.120]  我們會選擇去受苦
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.120]  我們怎麼可以做學生
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.120]  在香港做學生
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.120]  怎麼可以跟隨主耶穌
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.120]  我們怎麼可以每天
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.120]  跟隨主耶穌
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.120]  我們怎麼做
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.120]  有很多選擇
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.120]  很多選擇在打擊我們
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.120]  又有Instagram
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120]  又有YouTube
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120]  電視
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120]  每個人都告訴我們
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.120]  應該追求什麼
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:44.120]  我們怎麼可以每天跟隨主耶穌
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.120]  成為正義的奴隸
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.120]  其實我們靠自己
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.120]  是沒有力量的
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.120]  我們靠自己是沒有力量的
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.120]  我們要依賴什麼
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.120]  我們要依賴靈魂

[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.120]  來指導我們
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.120]  因為我們自己
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120]  我們很弱
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.120]  我們做不到
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.120]  但是有神在我們身邊

[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:36.120]  成為正義的奴隸
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.120]  我們祈禱
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.120]  然後慈悲團隊可以上台
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.120]  神父
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.120]  我們感謝您的信息
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:48.120]  我們感謝您給我們選擇
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.120]  選擇並不是容易
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.120]  我祈求您幫助我們
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.120]  克服這生命和世界的挑戰
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.120]  讓我們可以跟隨您
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.120]  相信您
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.120]  讓我們可以成為正義的奴隸
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.120]  讓我們可以成為聖
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.120]  因為您是聖
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.120]  並且有永恆的生命
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.120]  我們在耶穌的名下祈禱
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120]  阿們
