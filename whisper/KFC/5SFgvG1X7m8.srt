00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Welcome to Explorer. Today we are going to think about God's Word.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 This week is the third sermon of Becoming the Winner of Life Series.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 In the last two weeks, Pastor Irene has talked about how to define success.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Pastor Johnny has also talked about how to pay for success.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 We can learn a lot from Pastor Johnny's teaching.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 We often talk about success, becoming the winner.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 We often see success in the spiritual aspect,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 which is the relationship between us and God.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Success in life, education, etc. may not be in conflict with us.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 But in a realistic situation, we need to make choices.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 For example, when we see a pandemic,

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 we may have to cancel the church service.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 These are the times when we have to make choices in life.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 What do we need to pay attention to when making choices?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 We may have a lot of considerations.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Is there any resource in the Bible that can help us make decisions?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Let's look at the 30 chapters of the Bible.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Let's think about how to make choices.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 The Bible is very important to the Israelites.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 The Bible has a lot of principles of faith.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It explains how the Israelites have fallen in history.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 The arrival of the Israelites in Galilee was a big moment.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 They ended their many years of exile and officially entered God's business.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 If we remember the books of Ezekiel and Nehemiah,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 there are many laws and rules written by God to the Israelites.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 These rules and rules may be unfamiliar to us in our society.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 If we break these rules, we will be punished.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 The Bible has more than 30 chapters.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 The Bible is located at the last part of the Bible.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 It is the last part of the Bible.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 In the previous part, Moses has given a lot of instructions on how to follow the law.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Today, we are going to look at the last part of Moses' instruction on the Israelites.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 We said that we may follow the law in our society.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 If we break these rules, we will be punished.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But does God look at us like this?

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Are we really afraid of God's punishment because we make life decisions?

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 What I want to tell you today is that we make life decisions

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 not because we are afraid of making mistakes.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 We are not afraid of failure.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It is because we love God and we are willing to choose what God expects us to choose.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 We make life decisions.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 The first point I want to talk about is the foundation of choice.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 The foundation of choice is that we are willing to love God and our relationship with God.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 In the Bible, chapter 30, verses 15-16, it says,

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 "And the Lord said to Hannah, 'Today I have written the new testament before you,

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 and I have commanded you to love Jehovah your God, to follow his way,

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 to follow his commandments, laws, and commandments,

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 so that you may be able to live forever and have many people.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Jehovah your God, may all your works be fulfilled, and may your blessings be upon the earth as it is in heaven.'"

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 This is the conclusion of Moses to the Israelites.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 It is worth noting that the first sentence in the Bible is not a punishment to warn or warn the Israelites.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 In today's society, if we make a mistake, we have to bear the consequences.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 For example, if we litter, we have to pay a fine of $1,500.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Some laws are not very suspicious.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 For example, have you ever tried to drink water on the subway?

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 It turns out that drinking water on the subway is not allowed.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Drinking water is against the regulations of Hong Kong Railways.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 It turns out that drinking water on the subway is against one of the regulations of Hong Kong Railways.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 This regulation says that after entering the train station,

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 you cannot eat or try to eat any food, drink or try to drink any drink,

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 whether it is alcoholic or non-alcoholic.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It sounds like a long reading.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Of course, water is also included in this regulation.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 So if someone has tried to drink water on the subway,

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 it is against the regulations.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 If we do it, we will be found out and we have to pay a fine of $2,000.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 These are some of the regulations in society.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I mentioned some of the strange regulations in the last month's lecture.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 In a nutshell, when we look at some of the regulations in the Bible,

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 the writing is a bit similar.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 For example, I will give you the simplest example.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 In the 22nd chapter of the Bible, chapter 6-7, it says,

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 "If you meet a birdcage on the way, or on a tree, or on the ground,

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 or on the water, or on a tree, or on a tree,

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 or on a tree, or on a tree, or on a tree,

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 you cannot take it with you,

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 but you can take it with you,

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 so that you can be happy and live a long life."

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 It turns out that many laws in the Bible are very detailed.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 As we just saw, whether it is garbage, or even the Hong Kong Railway Act,

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 these are all very detailed parts.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Even the birds can go to Hong Kong.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 In the Bible, there are 613 laws in the 5 books,

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 the Genesis, the Egyptian, the Leviticus, the Gospels, and the Gospels.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 You may say, "Wow, so many laws.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Isn't it easy to be misled and fall into the wrong path,

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 and then be punished by God?"

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But as I mentioned earlier,

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 the core of the Bible is not just about being punished for breaking the law.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Today, the law of our society often scares us

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 by punishing us,

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 by telling us not to do wrong things.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But in life, we have to make a successful decision,

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 not just because we are afraid of the consequences.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 For the Israelites, the most important reason for following the law is not to avoid punishment,

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 but because they are willing to love Jehovah,

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 and they are willing to choose the right way to express their love and loyalty to God.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 The key to success for the Israelites is not relying on their military,

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 political, economic, or their own ability,

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 but to follow the law of Jehovah.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And it is in the law that God finds their heart.

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 So in the Bible, the Israelites choose to follow God,

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 to follow the law,

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 not to be punished, not to be fined, not to be imprisoned,

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 not to be killed by God,

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 but because they are willing to cherish the relationship with God.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 In fact, we read some of the scriptures in the 30th chapter of the Bible,

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 chapter 9-10, God is very sure that

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 when the Israelites are willing to love God,

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 God will make all the things in their hands,

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 all the things they have created, all the things they have done,

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 all the things they have done,

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 all the things they have done,

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 all the things they have done,

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 God knows.

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 God wants us to make choices,

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 not only the relationship,

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 but also to experience it in our lives.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 For example,

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 maybe you are listening to this sermon today,

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 or you are a student who has just finished the DSC exam,

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 or you are preparing to study hard for the DSC,

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 or you are going to study,

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 actually, the most important thing for us is to study.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 In last month's "HK Road",

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I mentioned a Singaporean church

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 who have high requirements for their students' studies,

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 and they will use the awards to encourage them to study hard.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Are there any successful examples?

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Here are some of the users' personal experiences.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Let's watch the video.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 One of the academic excellence services,

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I learned it's more important to ask the right question

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 than to find the right answers.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I realized that I had to take ownership of my learning.

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 So in class, I start asking my teacher questions.

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I began to understand the content better.

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I also learned to communicate my thoughts more clearly.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It also helped that I could depend on God.

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Every time I studied,

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I prayed to God for wisdom and understanding.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Whenever I was stressed,

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 God gave me the peace to focus and stay motivated.

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 As I changed my study habits and my mindset towards studying,

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 my results improved greatly.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 For all the four semesters in IT,

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I scored a perfect GPA of 4 out of 4.

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I graduated with two awards as a top student of my course.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Out of the entire IT core of 25,000 students,

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I was one out of 15 who were awarded the Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 This award recognizes students with outstanding academic

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and co-curricular achievements.

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 This gave me a full scholarship to pursue a diploma in polytechnic.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 There, I continued to do well and graduated with a GPA of 3.65 out of 4.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 This result meant that I was eligible for all the top universities in Singapore.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I was so happy to secure a place in Nanyang Technological University

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 to study engineering.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Through the Academy Excellence Program,

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I was also inspired to look beyond myself and to think for others.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 During my first year in university,

161
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I heard about the Interfaith Tuition Program

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 organized by Heart of God Church and Khaled Moss.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Tutors from both the church and the Moss provided free tuition

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 for the secondary school students taking their major exams.

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 It was the perfect opportunity to help others.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So, I volunteered myself to be a tutor.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 It touched my heart to be able to guide the students in their studies.

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 In church, I mentored a group of 20 young people.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Some of them struggled in their confidence like how I used to.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I felt so much for them.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I knew their lives could be changed too, just as how God changed mine.

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Throughout my time in university,

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 my grades improved with each semester.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 After three years, I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours.

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Never would I have imagined a boy like me to get a university degree.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 In fact, I was the first in my family to graduate from a university.

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 My family was so proud.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Initially, I thought getting a job would be difficult.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I would have been happy to receive any job offer.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 But even before I graduated, miraculously I received paid job offers.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 After graduation, I chose to work as a management associate in a multinational company.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Looking back, the principles I've learned through the Academy Excellence Programme

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 have changed the way I approach my studies and in fact, my entire life.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 I've come so far from the lazy boy who was never interested in studying.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 From EM3 to IT to Polytechnic to university.

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And now, as a young working adult, God has been with me every step of the way.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I'm so grateful to God for Heart of God Church and its Academy Excellence Programme.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 If we watch this video, we might feel that

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 the so-called success of life, not only in the name of the Holy Spirit,

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 can also affect what happens in our daily lives.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 As the Bible says, when we love God and are willing to make His will,

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 this real success is not just a success in the name of the Holy Spirit,

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 but it can also be reflected in our daily lives.

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 When we make our life decisions based on the motivation of loving God,

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 what we get can go far beyond our expectations.

196
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 This is different from the way we follow the law,

197
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 or the way we follow the law in society, or the way we follow the law in school.

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 The motivation is different.

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 In society, we are often afraid of being arrested by the police,

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 or even afraid of being jailed.

201
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 But God does not use this method to control the Israelis.

202
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 When He explains these provisions,

203
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 even though the Israelis are arrested, they still have to use other methods to pay the price.

204
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 But God still hopes that the Israelis can live a truly blessed life.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 The core motivation of the Israeli Law of Protection is their willingness to love God.

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 If we love God as the basis of our choices,

207
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 what are the principles of our choices?

208
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Of course, there are a lot of different choices in life.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 For example, today, after you wake up or after you listen to this sermon,

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 do you want to eat? Where do you want to go?

211
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Of course, during this time of the epidemic, we may not go out often,

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 but we may think about what we want to eat, and whether we want to meet our friends.

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 These may be small decisions.

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And maybe when someone in the middle of the day wants to choose what major to study in university,

215
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 these decisions are very different.

216
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It may seem to affect your life decisions.

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Of course, today, our sermon is mainly about some major decisions,

218
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 that is, decisions about the direction of life.

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Everyone has a different situation,

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 that is, there are many factors to consider.

221
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 But today I just want to tell you about a big principle,

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 which is to choose what is best for your life.

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Or, in the words of the Bible, "choose your life".

224
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 In the 30th chapter of the Bible, verses 19-20, it says,

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 "Today I am calling upon the heavens and the earth to witness to you,

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 that I will bring forth the new life and the blessed life before you.

227
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 So you must choose your life,

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 so that you and your descendants may live forever.

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And I will call upon your God, and if you listen to him,

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 you will be in his care, for he is your life,

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 and your days will be long, depending on him."

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 As we mentioned, the basis for our choice is to love our God,

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 and to be willing to glorify Him.

234
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Often we will get more than we think.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 But we also understand that in reality,

236
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 when we follow the command of God to make a choice,

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 there is a chance of loss.

238
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 For example, two years ago, I was serving a group of college students at the Sun Yat-sen factory.

239
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 One of the students, a sophomore,

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 was studying engineering at the university.

241
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 He mentioned that he wanted to go to the university to do a postgraduate study.

242
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I think he was a good student,

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 so he might not have been suspected of having a cat.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 In fact, in the Sun Yat-sen factory,

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 students are used to having a cat when they are studying.

246
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Of course, as we all know,

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 the exam is normally submitted by the teacher during the exam,

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 and the student is not allowed to have a cat.

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 But this sophomore, who was studying engineering in the second year,

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 encountered a problem.

251
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 The teacher would tell the student the exam questions in advance.

252
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 After the exam, the student could cheat.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 In other words, the teacher would not care if the student took out a book and copied the answer.

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Why did he do that?

255
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Because in this university,

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 the teacher's ranking and grades

257
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 depend on the students' grades in the exam.

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 So the teacher could let the student cheat,

259
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 or even tell the student the question,

260
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 which could improve the student's performance

261
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 or the evaluation.

262
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 The cat student was not a problem.

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Because the teacher could get a good grade,

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 and the student could get a good grade.

265
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 So the student could get a good grade.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Of course, everyone understands that

267
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 this is unacceptable for the Christian.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So for this sophomore,

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 he faced a big challenge.

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 He could get 100 points if he had a cat with the student.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 He would not be very optimistic.

272
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 If he didn't have a cat,

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 and he just studied,

274
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 his grades would be low.

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The students would laugh at him,

276
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 or ask him why he was so stupid.

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 How did he make this decision?

278
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I don't know if you think it's just a test.

279
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Just a test.

280
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Just let it go.

281
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 At most, he could pray to God to forgive him.

282
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 But I think in the Bible,

283
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 we make decisions in our life.

284
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Not all decisions are perfect.

285
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 We just learned that

286
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 there are many successful testimonies

287
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 in the Singapore church

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 that God is unyielding.

289
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 But sometimes, in the real world,

290
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 God is likely to have a big loss,

291
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 or be laughed at.

292
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 If we look at the part of the Bible

293
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 where Moses is mentioned,

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 in the 19th to 20th verses,

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 he tells the Israelites that

296
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 God has given him a new life,

297
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and he will die for them.

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Moses did not say that

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 you have to choose a life

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 that is pure and pure.

301
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 He said that you have to choose your life,

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 so that you and your descendants

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 can be saved.

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 The choice of life is not just about

305
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 the good of the material world,

306
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 or the success of your life.

307
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 It is also about whether the Israelites

308
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 can use God's blessings

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 to choose a meaningful life.

310
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 At that time, many foreigners in Ghana

311
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 were happy when they worshiped God,

312
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 or when they let their desires go.

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 But they were still restricted by many restrictions,

314
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 whether it was material,

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 or religious indulgence,

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 or moral corruption,

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 or social chaos.

318
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 God hopes that the Israelites choose their lives

319
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 so that they will not fall into the trap of others,

320
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 but so that our lives have true freedom,

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 and meaningful lives.

322
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 The brother mentioned earlier,

323
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 how did he decide?

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 He did not show his cat.

325
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 He did not look at the questions.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 The teacher would send an email

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 to say that he would give the questions.

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But he did not look at the questions.

329
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 You may think that

330
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 he got full marks.

331
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 History is not always perfect.

332
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 The whole class got 90+ marks.

333
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 The brother only got 60+ marks.

334
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 But when he shared this testimony

335
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 with other brothers in the group,

336
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 he said directly,

337
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 "I am suffering for Christ."

338
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 "When my classmates asked me why I was so stupid,

339
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I told them I was a Christian,

340
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and I did not want to show my cat."

341
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 The brother was in a society

342
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 that was based on atheism,

343
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 and even against the Church.

344
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Many people wanted to be in the church,

345
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 but they were not as good as the church.

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 They wanted to make quick money.

347
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 They did not care about morality.

348
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 The brother had a small choice.

349
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Of course, his grades were important to him.

350
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 He could have followed others,

351
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 but he chose to stick to his values.

352
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 He chose to live a life

353
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 that God wanted him to live.

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 He did not care about the price.

355
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I do not know what you are going to face today.

356
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Maybe some of you will have to

357
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 choose your major.

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But I want to tell you

359
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 that God is watching over us.

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 It is not about what we choose.

361
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 It is not about whether we are successful or not.

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 God wants us to love Him.

363
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 He wants us to choose the most meaningful decision.

364
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Our mentors, pastors,

365
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 and friends can give us advice

366
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 and help us choose the best decision.

367
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But the final decision is yours.

368
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 When we talk about the winner of life,

369
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 we hope to be successful in life.

370
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 But the relationship between us and God is more important.

371
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 The true winner is defined by God's expectation

372
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and love for us.

373
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 What do you think of God's love for you?

374
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Do you think that following the law

375
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 or following the Bible is a difficult thing?

376
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 But what do you think is the most important thing in your life?

377
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 How do you want to get it?

378
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 The most basic question is

379
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 that we are Christians and we believe in Jesus.

380
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Does believing in Jesus bring us a change

381
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 in our life and our decisions?

382
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 But we can also make a meaningful decision

383
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 in our life.

384
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Let's pray together.

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 God of mercy,

386
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 thank you for letting us understand and learn the law.

387
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 You remind us that success is the relationship between us

388
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 and the life we live.

389
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Lord Jesus,

390
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 thank you for blessing us today.

391
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 We are in a pandemic,

392
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 but you are healthy.

393
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 We are healthy and wise.

394
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 We pray for our students who are waiting for the exam.

395
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 We pray for them to have a peaceful life.

396
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Lord, bless us to experience more in our life.

397
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Thank you for listening to our prayer.

398
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Amen.

399
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:42,000
