[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (Applause)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Awesome!
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   And so we're starting this road toward Lent,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   and Lent is a time that we just want to calm down,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   we want to slow down.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   As we head towards Easter,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   we want to head towards our Creator,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and we want to offer more and more time towards Him.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And so Lent is often the time where we start to think
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   to give up something.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Some people might give up, I don't know, Instagram,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   some people might give up meat,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   as they prepare themselves to understand
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   what Christ also went through.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   That He Himself gave up the most precious thing,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   and which was His life.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And so we're entering into a series of parables,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and the first parable we're going through today
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   is the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And so you saw in the video there, great video,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   we're doing the one app together,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and it's going to lead us towards Lent.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And so as you saw in the video,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   this story started with the Pharisees, right?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   The teachers of the law, and they were questioning Jesus, right?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   They were threatened by Jesus, His authority,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   His miracles, His power.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   They wanted to sort of trap Him.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And this one person, maybe he was actually curious,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   or maybe he actually wanted to trap Jesus,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   but how can I inherit eternal life?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And Jesus says, "What do you think?"
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Well, it's great, you know, just dialogue, right?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He said, "Well, what do you think?"
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Well, you gotta love the Lord, our God,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   with all our heart, mind, soul, strength, everything.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And then we gotta love our neighbor as ourselves.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And Jesus asks, well, He asks, "Who is my neighbor?"
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And so Jesus says this story.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Now, we don't know if it was a made-up story,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   but it was also very common back then
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   that people would travel from Jerusalem to Jericho, right?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And the Israel team, did you guys walk from Israel to Jericho?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Did you guys do that walk? No? Too far of a walk?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Okay, too far of a walk.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, as you see, the walk is not very foresty.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The walk is quite barren, actually, quite barren.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And as you see in the next slide,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   it's also, the elevation is quite high.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So Jerusalem is approximately 800 meters higher than Jericho, right?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Jericho obviously was known for, you know,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   that big walled city, right, that was destroyed.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And so, as you see in the next slide,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   it's around a seven and a half, seven hour walk
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   from Jerusalem down to Jericho.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Anybody wanna do a seven and a half hour walk?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah, okay, Hanani wants to do it. Very good.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It might be quite hot in Jerusalem right now, quite hot.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Like the Hong Kong summers, maybe not as humid or maybe just as humid.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So they would know exactly what Jesus was talking about,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   walking from Jerusalem to Jericho, not uncommon.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   The thing about this place was that it was very barren.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   There was mountains and different hills and valleys among the way.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And so it would be easy for people to hide
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   and also to attack you, right?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And so I don't know if you've watched some of these TV shows
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   like Walking Dead or Mad Max or something like that.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You know the apocalypse, right? They love that.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   There's no like police system in the apocalypse,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   the zombie land, you don't know who's there, right?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Have you guys watched some of these TV shows?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So they're taking a stroll through this new territory,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   they don't know, they see somebody there
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and then somebody pops up and robs them.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah, they're easy targets, they don't know where they're going.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   They don't know who, this new place, they don't know.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And in the same way, this new place, well that's not new place,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   but this place was known to be possibly places where you could get robbed.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Alright? It was a desolate place,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   there was nothing really between Jericho and Jerusalem
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and people could run away, rob you and run away
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   or they could hide and wait for you to come.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And so on this particular, in this particular story,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Jesus is talking about this person that is taking a walk
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   from Jerusalem down to Jericho.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And he is robbed, he is beaten, he is stripped
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and he is left there, left for dead, left for dead.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And there's three characters that come.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And so the first character, who's the first character?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The priest, okay? The priest.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And so what do we know about priests back then?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Well, they had to be direct descendants of Aaron.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Aaron is the brother of Moses and Aaron was the first priest.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Okay? And so imagine in this society,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   the theocral society,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   society where God is the head,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   the priests were very important.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   They had a lot of power, they had a lot of responsibility,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   they were highly respected.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And the high priest was the leader among the priests.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And the high priest, once a year, had the responsibility
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   of going into the Holy of Holies to get atonement for Israel.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The Holy of Holies is the very special place within the temple.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And if you were not pure and holy before the Lord,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   what would happen to the priest?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   You would drop dead.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And so the priest, imagine the church, within this church,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   imagine the church is the city or the country.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Who is sort of leading the country or the church?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It's the senior pastor.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And so in the same way, the high priest was like the senior pastor.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And so let's look at the diagram of the society back then,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   the cultural society back then.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   So the priests were sort of the hierarchy.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And under the priests were the Levites.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And under the Levites, as you see, the Levites,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   the priests and the Sadducees were another sect of priests
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   that focused on another thing.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And then on the other side were the Pharisees,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   where they were the lawyers, the laws.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   They knew the laws very well.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And you look at the next slide.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So the priests were sort of the most important
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   or had the highest position in society.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And then it was the Levites, and then it was the Jews,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   and the Samaritans were the lowest in the society.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Okay, so next, the Levites.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Who were the Levites?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   They had to be born of the tribe of the Levites, yes.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And so they could study their way
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and possibly gain higher and higher position
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   within the Levite system.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And so, for example, you had the senior pastor or the pastors,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   which are sort of the high priest or the priests, right?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And the Levites would be sort of the workers within the church.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So the Levites would help build the church,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   they would help clean the church,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   they would help carry the ark,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   they would help in different rituals within the temple.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And so this was the role of the Levites.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   They were the second, sort of the second highest position
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   within that society.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And so both of them were very important.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   High, respected people within society.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And then the third character in this story is who?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Who is the third character in this story?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   The Samaritan.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Now, do you remember a couple of weeks or a month ago,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I talked about a Samaritan woman, right?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And Jesus had an interaction with the Samaritan woman.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And in this story, I outlined the different difficulties
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   that Jesus faced with interacting with this woman.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Firstly, Jesus was a man, and not just any man,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   he was a man of respected, he was respected like a teacher.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The Samaritan was an outcast.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But what is more important is the relationship
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   between Jews and the Samaritans.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Do you guys remember what the relationship was?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Were they best buds?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Were they like Americans and Canadians, best buds?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   No, they weren't, right?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   They were sort of like modern day Israel and Palestine,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   they didn't like each other.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   They were fighting with each other.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Israel looked, Jews looked down on Samaritans.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Why did they look down on them?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Because they were impure.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   They were intermixed, they were interbred
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   with their enemy back then, which were the Assyrians.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And so they looked down on the Samaritans.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And religiously, the Samaritans also were not allowed
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   into the temple, not allowed into Jerusalem,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   because they were considered impure, right? Impure.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And so this Samaritan in this story was the same.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   He was considered an outcast, he was impure.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   He was a half Gentile and a half Jew.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And so they were looked down upon by the Jews.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   So there's three people in this story.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   The priest walks by, right?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   The Levite walks by and sees this man,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   half dead, stripped, beaten.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And then the Samaritan also comes and walks by.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And so a lot of the times, we look at this story
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and the classic thing is to say, "Who are we in this story?"
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Are we the high priest and the Levite,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   as you see in the next slide?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Who are we in this story?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Are we the high priest?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Are we the Levite in this story?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Or are we the Samaritan in this story?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Well, in some occasions, well, honestly,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   we are all three in some situations.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   We are all three in some situations.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   The high priest and the Levite,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   they are known to be of high position,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   highly respected, religious, they're looked up upon.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But yet in this situation, we see in the next slide,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   they act selfishly.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   They act selfishly. How are they acting selfishly?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Well, they see this person, half dead, right?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   They don't know if this person is alive.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And so back then, if you touched a corpse or a dead person,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   what would happen to you?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   You would become unclean, unclean.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And you would need to go through a period of quarantine, okay?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   14-day quarantine in a hotel.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   No, I'm just joking, right?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   You would have to separate yourself from the temple
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   or from serving for a period of time
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   because you would become unclean.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And so they were selfish.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   They were looking out for themselves.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   They didn't want to go through this body.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   They want to jeopardize their own status
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   or their ability to serve in the church or in the temple back then.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And also, they had the idea of self-preservation.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Self-preservation.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   What were they worried about?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   What would they possibly be worried about?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Being robbed, right?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Well, if this person is robbed,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   maybe the robbers are nearby,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   and they're staking out me, the next person who is coming.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   So possibly, they are trying to just walk pie quickly, right?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Not get hurt, not get robbed, get out of this situation,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   arrive to their next destination safely.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Self-preservation.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   They didn't want to go down there and help this person
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   in fear that somebody might attack them.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And a lot of the situations, we've also been through that, right?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   We might have walked by the street
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   and seen some homeless people who needed help.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And we're like, "Oh, we don't have time.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   We're going to church.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   We don't have time.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   We're late for our church meeting."
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Or somebody is asking us for food,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and we just sort of look the other way,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and pretend we don't see them.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And unfortunately, we've been there.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   We've been there.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I used to drive in Toronto,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and as I drove towards the downtown area,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   there was this one traffic light.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And this one traffic light, there would always be beggars
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   that come out to ask you for money
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   when you stopped at that traffic light.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They would take their cup and be like,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   "Hey, do you have money? Do you have any?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Do you have money? Knock on the next car.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Do you have money?"
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And I knew.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And I knew.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   So I would have granola bars.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I would have fruit ready to give to them
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   because I knew they were coming.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And so sometimes they would take it.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Sometimes they were like, "Oh, no. I don't want it."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And that's their choice.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So I sort of prepared for these people.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I knew they were coming, and I wanted to help them,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   and I wanted to give them some food
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and see if they would take it.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   But a lot of times, people might ignore them.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   A lot of times, people might ignore them.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And I remember this one story.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   One of my friends was sick in the MTR, right?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And she was so sick to the point
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   where she sort of fainted and passed out.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And what do you think people did in the MTR?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   What do you think people did in the MTR?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   They ran away.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   They ran away.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   They thought she had COVID.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   They had some sort of disease.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   They were separating themselves, right?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Like she had some sort of magic force field around her.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And then eventually what happened was
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   the MTR people came and helped her
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and got her to the hospital and helped her.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   But this is sort of like what was happening here
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   with the Levites and the high priest or the priest.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   They saw this person.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   They didn't know what this person had.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Maybe they had COVID.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   No, they didn't have COVID back then.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   And they wanted to run away.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   They were self-preservation.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   They were focused on self-preservation,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and they were focused on themselves.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   They didn't want their status
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   or their reputation to be ruined, right?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And so next, what happened?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   There was a Samaritan that came by.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And the Samaritan wasn't focused on himself.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   This person wasn't focused on his own selfishness
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and self-preservation,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   but he was focused on being selfless.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   He saw this person and helped him,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   went to him, bandaged him up,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   brought him onto the donkey,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and took him to a place of sanctuary, of recovery.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And at times, we are also like this Samaritan person, right?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   We've gone through some times
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   where we've went to the Mongkok area
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   to hand out sandwiches,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   hand out food boxes to the poor, to the needy,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   people that are living in those walkways
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   or those tunnelways in Hong Kong.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And we've gone out, we've lended our hand,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   we've prayed for these people.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   We've gone out weekly to hand out sandwiches to these people.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And so the classic understanding of this parable is,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   who are we?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Are we the priest? Are we the Levite?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Or are we the Samaritan that goes out mercifully
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   to help those in need,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   to help our neighbor?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Who is our neighbor?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Our neighbor is the person that is in need, right?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Helping those that we see,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   the people around us that are in need.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   There's another sort of side to this story.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   There's another side to this story.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And it's not looking at who are we
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   as the priest, as the Levite, as the Samaritan.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   But it's to understand that in fact,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   we are the victim.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   We are the victim in this story.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Have you thought about it?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   That you are the one that is beaten,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   robbed, stripped in this story.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   You are the one that is left half dead.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Can you imagine? You are that person.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And we are in need of a good Samaritan.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   We are in need of a good Samaritan.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Who has robbed us?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Who has beaten us?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Who has stripped us?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Who has stripped us?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Who has left us helpless?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Ultimately, it is a three-letter word.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It starts with an S.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Sin.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Sin has left us beaten, broken, stripped, and helpless.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   A month ago, we went through the testings of Jesus, right?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   How He went through all the testings of this world.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   The temptations of this world.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   The temptation of the flesh, our hedonism.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   The temptation of our eyes, materialism.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   We see it and we want it.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   The temptation of our pride, egoism.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And yet, Jesus was that person
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   that went through all these temptations,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   and yet, He was without sin.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   He held that weight.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   That weight of temptation.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And yet, He did not drop that power bar.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   He did not.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   He was without sin.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And we went through that ultimately,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   the testing of our flesh is lust,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   gluttony, sloth, pride.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Lust leaves us sexually impure, right?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   We have unrestrained sexual craving,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and that leaves us impure in the eyes of God.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Gluttony leaves us physically broken
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   because our physical body is not working
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   the way that God has designed it.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   We are becoming overweight.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   We are stuffing ourselves with things,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   overindulging ourselves.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Sloth is in the same, but in the opposite direction.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   We are becoming lazy and lack of effort.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   This leaves us broken.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It could leave us financially broken
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   because we become lazy and raft.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It could lead to things that we do out of raft.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Broken relationships.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Hurting ourselves even.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   This leaves us to brokenness.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Greed leaves us to desire things excessively.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And ultimately, that leaves us broken, empty.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We search for money, money, money.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   We search for materialism, materialism.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And ultimately, these things leave us empty.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And some of you have been through it.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You've gone to the highest peak financially.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And at the end of it, money comes, money goes.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   You've gone through all the money,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   all the materialism in the world,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   all the bags, all the watches,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   all the shoes in the world.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   But at the end of it, it's emptiness.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   It's emptiness.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And there's envy, which leaves us broken
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   in our relationship with others
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   because we're jealous or we envy what other people have.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And it leaves ourselves broken.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And finally, there's pride.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Pride leaves us ultimately broken
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   because we believe we are right.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And we believe we are right over God.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   We are right over God.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And so sin beats us, strips us,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   leaves us helpless, half dead.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   We are physically broken, materially broke.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Mentally, we are broken, depressed.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And we have broken relationships.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   We are the victim in this story.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   We are the victim in this story.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I had a friend.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And you know how most gentlemen are, right?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   They don't talk about their issues.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   You guys like that?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Don't talk about their issues, right?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   You put up, "I'm a 'Tai Lam Yin'," right?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   "Tai Lam Yin."
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   It's hard for them to talk about issues.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And so when he called me,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   and I was like, "Hey, I really need to talk."
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I was like, "Oh, what's up?"
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Right?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And he was emotionally and spiritually very low
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   because he was reading scripture
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and God convicted him of all the sin
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   that he had been going through.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   He was in a past church,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and he didn't stay at that church
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   because there were so many relationships
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   that he had conflict with.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And instead of solving those conflicts,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   he just wanted to escape.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   He escaped, and that left broken relationships.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And he recalled all the bad things he said
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   to his sister and to his family
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and the hurtful things that he said.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And he was like, "I'm so broken.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   "Spiritually, I'm broken.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   "These relationships are broken,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "and I have not faced any of the issues
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   "that I've gone through."
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And he's like, "I don't know where I'm heading
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   "in my future, and all I'm doing
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   "is just going after my flesh
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   "that my human wants,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   "and I'm not placing God first,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   "and I'm feeling broken inside."
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   He's feeling broken,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   and he was like this man
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   that was beaten, stripped,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   left for dead, robbed.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   He was like this person.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I recall another friend
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   that I spent time with this week,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   and he was telling me about his family.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   He married a girl,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   and now they have a son.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   But this woman goes through sort of bipolar
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   and goes through different mental illnesses,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   and she has fits of rage
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   where this relationship has become abusive.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   She's very abusive,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   calling him names every day
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and taking it out on their son,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   taking it out on him.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And sin, the brokenness of this world
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   has caused brokenness in this family.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And now he doesn't know what to do,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   but he thinks the only thing to do
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   is separation
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   because of the abuse in this family
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   of his wife onto him
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and calling him names
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   and taking it out on his son.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   There's brokenness in this family.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   It's left him robbed, beaten, broken,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   not knowing what to do.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And he's lost faith in God.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   He's like, "Johnny, I don't believe in prayer anymore.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   "I don't believe in prayer anymore.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   "I'm so broken.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   "I've been in this relationship, marriage,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   "for five years,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   "and I've been trying to fix it.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   "I've been praying to God,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   "and I'm just so desperate.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   "I don't know what to do anymore."
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Broken, beaten, physically broke,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   materially broke, mentally broken,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   broken relationship.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   My first friend needs a good Samaritan.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   My friend who's in this marriage
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   needs a good Samaritan.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   We need a good Samaritan.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And Jesus is that ultimate good Samaritan.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Let's read this passage together one more time together.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Can you read for me?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   One, two, three.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   "But a Samaritan, as he traveled,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   "came where the man was,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   "and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   "He went to him and bandaged his wounds,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   "pouring on oil and wine.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   "Then he put the man on his own donkey,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   "brought him into an inn,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   "and took care of him.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   "The next day, he took out two denarii
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   "and gave them to the innkeeper.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   "'Look after him,' he said,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   "'and when I return, I will reimburse you
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   "'any extra expense that you may have.'"
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   The first thing that this Samaritan person did
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   was he did what?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   He came to where the man was,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   and he saw him.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   He saw him.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Many times, we're walking on the street
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and there's a beggar, there's somebody really dirty,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and we don't even want to look at that person.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   The priest and the Levite,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   they didn't even want to look at this person,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   whether he was alive or dead.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   They didn't know.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   They just wanted to go along the way.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   But this Samaritan, good Samaritan,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   looked upon that person.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   There is acceptance.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   There is love.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   There's sort of acknowledgement
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   that this is an actual person.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And in the same way,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   as we are beaten, broken, robbed because of sin,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   who looks at us?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Who looks at us?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Jesus is looking at you.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Jesus is looking at you.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   In your state, in your brokenness,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He sees you.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   He sees you and He's coming towards you.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Jesus is the good Samaritan,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   accepting us, acknowledging our situation.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   The next thing the Samaritan did
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   was He took pity on this person.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And Jesus also knows our situation
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and He has compassion upon us.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Whatever we are going through,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   the sin that we're struggling through,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Jesus understands.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   He has compassion upon you.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He has compassion amongst us.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   What's the next thing the good Samaritan did?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   What did he do?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   He bandaged up that person.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Jesus is a good Samaritan
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   that is also looking to heal us.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Sin has left us wounded
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   and Jesus has come, ultimately,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   paid the ultimate price for us
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   to be healed of our wounds.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   He used oil.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   He used oil and wine.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Oil signifying cleansing,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   the coming of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Oil, right?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Oil, healing oil.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   The Holy Spirit also guides us,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   heals us, leads us.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Wine signifying cleansing.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   The good Samaritan used wine
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   to cleanse the wounds.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   The alcohol within it.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Jesus comes with forgiveness.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   The wine represents His blood
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   shed for us on the cross.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And there is forgiveness.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   The wine represents the forgiveness of sins
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and He paid two denarii.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Two denarii for the innkeeper.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Jesus leads us, ultimately,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   to sanctuary,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   to heaven,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   to a better place,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   a place where we one day
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   be fully healed.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And what did He say?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   The good Samaritan, what did He say?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   He will return.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   He will return.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And Jesus also says He will return.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   There is hope.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Jesus will one day come back.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Jesus will fully heal us, restore us.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   There is hope.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   There is hope.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   There's hope for my friend
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   who is going through all
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   these spiritual, physical, mental brokenness.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   There is hope for my friend
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   who is in this marriage,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   in this family, and doesn't know what to do.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   There is hope.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   There is healing.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Jesus has not given up on them.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Jesus is with them.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Jesus sees their need.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Jesus sees their moments of need,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   their desperation, their brokenness.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And Jesus is there waiting for them,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   wanting to heal them, forgive them,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   give them the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   and give them hope.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Do we need a Savior today?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Do you need a Savior today?
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   As the band comes up,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   I just want us to have a moment
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   of reflection here.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Jesus is the Good Samaritan,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   the ultimate Samaritan,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Good Samaritan,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   who has come to save us.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   He knows your need.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   He knows what you're going through.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Maybe tonight you come with a heavy heart.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You're dealing with issues.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   You're dealing with problems in your life.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Maybe there are some things that you've done
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   and you can't forgive yourself.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   But Jesus sees you.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Jesus is coming towards you,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   and He wants to heal and forgive you.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Maybe you're coming with other issues,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   issues with family, with work,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   whatever it might be,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Jesus understands,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   and He wants to be your Savior.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   He wants to be your Savior.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Is there anybody here tonight
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   that is in need of a Savior?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Maybe you've come here for the first time
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   or the hundredth time,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   and you haven't asked Jesus
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   to be your Lord and Savior.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Would you be willing to surrender yourself,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   surrender your brokenness,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   surrender your sin,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   surrender your issues,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   surrender your problems to Him tonight?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   He is your Good Samaritan.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   He comes with acceptance,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   compassion, healing,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   forgiveness, and hope.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Is there anybody here
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   that's in need of a Savior?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   I'm going to say a prayer,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and I want all of us to pray this prayer,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   to ask Jesus to be our Savior.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Repeat after me.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Dear Jesus,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I admit that I am broken.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   I'm broken and robbed by sin.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I need a Savior.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   I thank you that you are the Good Samaritan,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   that you died on the cross for my sins,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   and on the third day,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   you rose again to prove
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   that you are conquer, victorious, victorious
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   over sin and death.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I now invite you
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   to be my Lord and my Savior,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   to give me healing and hope.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
