[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.560]   My name is Michelle,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.480]   and I serve as one of the pastors here.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.160]   This is your very first time.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.360]   Nice to meet you.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.960]   Now we live in a day and age
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.680]   where everything seems to be true
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.200]   as long as you have enough conviction
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.960]   and passion about it.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.440]   I mean, we hear about these slimming products, right?
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.960]   We wanna slim down ourselves,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   or we hear these hair growth products,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.480]   or we have all these books that teach us
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.520]   how to be successful, or just get the right stocks
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.720]   so then we can have more money, right?
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.240]   And so we tend to just follow things here and there,
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.400]   and we think that, oh, this is true, or that is true.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.080]   And we're tossed and turned around
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.960]   as if we're in the waves.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.960]   And so today we're really gonna look at what is the truth?
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.920]   What is the truth that Paul here really urges
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.800]   and commands Timothy to uphold?
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   And how is it that we can uphold it in our everyday lives?
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.680]   And as the scripture is here in 1 Timothy,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.520]   the very first chapter,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.800]   now Apostle Paul here is charging Timothy,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.760]   who literally is brought up in faith by Paul.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.480]   And he's saying to him, "Stay there," verse three,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.100]   "in Ephesus so that you may command certain people,"
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.780]   not everyone, just some,
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.480]   "not to teach false doctrines any longer,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.840]   "or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.940]   "Such things promote controversial speculations
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.800]   "rather than advancing God's work, which is by faith."
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   Now we look at this and we know that, okay,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.360]   there are false teachings,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.120]   but what are they?
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.160]   Now, Paul does not specify exactly what those are,
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.960]   but we actually look and reference to chapter six, verse three
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.080]   which we're not gonna look at, but I will let you know.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.040]   What is it?
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.280]   They are the things that go against Jesus's teaching.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.200]   And they are the things that don't bring people
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.440]   to godliness.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.520]   And so whatever those things are,
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.040]   those are the false teachings that Paul is addressing here.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.400]   And at the same time,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.680]   these people also devote themselves to myths
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.280]   and endless genealogies.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.200]   And myths are like those far-fetched stories.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.000]   They're like things, they're stories,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.320]   made up ones about gods of other sorts.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.360]   And also what are endless genealogies?
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.120]   Well, at those times, people like to look at the bloodline
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   to see what it is that they're entitled to,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.360]   rather it's priesthood that they can do or other things.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.440]   And so they just spend all this time doing all these things.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.600]   And that's why Apostle Paul's telling Timothy,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.520]   "Hey, stay there,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.760]   "because there's all these things that are going on."
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.880]   And not only that,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.760]   but they would promote controversial speculations.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.040]   They might be about how did things happen in the past
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.040]   or things about how are they gonna happen in the future?
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.360]   And actually in a similar sense,
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.680]   we might be like that today as well.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.560]   We might believe in myths and stories.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.640]   We actually are quite interested sometimes
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.560]   when people tell us,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   "Hey, you know, this is probably how things have happened
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.400]   "in the past."
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.160]   And we're like, "Oh, tell me more about it."
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.000]   'Cause it's fascinating to hear these stories.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.560]   Or we're interested in mythological things
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.040]   or mysterious things.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.520]   And sometimes when we hear about angelic beings,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.480]   our ears turn up like, "Oh, tell me more.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.280]   "I wanna know more about angels."
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.880]   Or like, "What's going to happen?
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.440]   "What about end time?"
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.240]   And I have friends who would say,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.640]   "Oh, you know what?
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.320]   "Jesus is gonna come back during my lifetime."
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.640]   And I'll be like, "Oh, how do you know about that?"
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.080]   And they will say, "Well, I just know
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.520]   "this is gonna happen."
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.920]   And so they tend to base it on things
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.080]   that are just myths, stories,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.600]   or things that give them a hunch.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.160]   And then also, we spend also time
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.680]   where sometimes we might match the current events
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.640]   with what's happening in the Bible, right?
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.960]   Oh, this is the symbol it stands for.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.600]   And if we have a certain leader
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.120]   that we think are unethical,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.560]   we might say, "Oh, look, they have the sign
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   "of the mark of 666, that's Satan."
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.040]   And so we start having all these speculations.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.600]   But what it's really saying here,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.760]   and if we go to verse six,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.320]   and it tells us that some of them
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.000]   have departed from these which are the truth
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.040]   and have turned into meaningless talks.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.600]   And what is Paul's really trying to tell Timothy
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.880]   and also to us is that stay focused
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.080]   on what's important, which is the truth
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.640]   in which we will look at.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.160]   And you see, these people in verse seven,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.080]   they said, "They want to be teachers of law,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.720]   "but they do not know what they're talking about
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.040]   "or what they so confidently affirm."
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.520]   So what we do see is that these people,
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.800]   they don't lack aspiration.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.360]   They wanna be teachers of law,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.320]   so they have this desire.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.360]   And also, they're confidently affirmed
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.600]   in what they wanna talk about.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.040]   So what that tells us is they're really zealous for it,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.000]   they're passionate about it.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.840]   But just because they have these two things,
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.520]   it's not enough, because here,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.160]   they don't have the most crucial thing,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.040]   which in the scripture, it tells us,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.600]   they do not know what they are talking about.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.440]   So what is it that they lack?
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.360]   Understanding.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   They don't have understanding.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.640]   And so this brings us to our first point,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.920]   which is in order to uphold the truth,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.600]   we must have true understanding of it.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Now, we might be thinking, well, what is true understanding?
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.240]   Well, the teachers and all these false teachers
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   seem to get it at some level.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.200]   They're like, okay, I get this, I get that.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   But they don't have true understanding.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.920]   And what we see is that Apostle Paul
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.200]   actually struggled with that as well.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.680]   At some point in his life,
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.840]   he was actually persecuting Christians.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.720]   And here in verse 13, he even wove in his own experience,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.280]   and he said, "I was once a blasphemer,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.880]   a persecutor, a violent man," and see what he says,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.400]   "and acted in ignorance and unbelief."
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.720]   He also claimed that at some point in his life,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.120]   he was ignorant.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.840]   He had no idea what the real meaning is, what's important.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.120]   And that's what happened with the false teacher.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.320]   They don't have true understanding.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.920]   And later we see that Paul had such a big turnaround
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   that he actually told us what is the proper use of the law.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.520]   And we see in verse nine, he names it out.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.640]   "The law is made not for the righteous.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.160]   "It isn't that these laws will gain you righteousness,
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.560]   "but it is for the lawbreakers, the rebels,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.520]   "the ungodly and the sinful, the unholy, irreligious,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.280]   "for those who kill their fathers or mothers,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.640]   "for those murderers, for the sexually immoral,
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.960]   "practicing homosexual, slave traders, liars,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.040]   "perjurers, and whatever else
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.680]   "is contrary to the sound doctrine."
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.280]   And once he had this full understanding
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.200]   of what the truth is, he knows also
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.680]   what the meaning is for the law and how to use it.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.080]   Now I wanna kind of give an example
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.360]   about how sometimes we kind of get things,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.120]   but we don't really get it.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.200]   I mean, for example, you might have a girlfriend
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.520]   or your wife may ask you,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.720]   "Oh, I would like some flowers."
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   Okay, so yes, on the surface level, they want flowers.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.240]   And that's how we can understand it too, you know?
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.800]   But really, what is the true meaning or the goal behind it
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.720]   is actually that she wants the guy
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   to display the adoration and the love that he has for her.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.200]   Now, if he gets that,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.120]   then that means he understood the true meaning
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.280]   of why he asked for flowers.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.160]   And on the contrary, the same,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.840]   when the boyfriend or the husband says to his girl,
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   "Listen to what I say."
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.520]   And on the surface, it's like
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.560]   just listening to what he wants.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.320]   And if we get that as the female or as the girl,
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.700]   then we only understand the surface level of it.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.400]   But what is it that's the goal
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.680]   or what is it that's the meaning behind it?
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.000]   Well, what he's really desiring is respect
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.960]   and also trust when he tells the girl to do something.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.560]   So in a similar way, you know,
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.280]   we might understand the Bible
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.400]   or we might understand the truth,
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.160]   but only in the surface level.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.280]   And if we don't understand the meaning behind it,
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.840]   then we've missed the point,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.360]   we've missed the goal of what the truth is talking about.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.920]   And so here we see that the false teachers
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.440]   have misunderstood a few things.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.080]   They devoted themselves to the wrong things
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.400]   and they don't even know how to use law properly.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.900]   And they don't know where righteousness come from,
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.200]   which is Jesus, and they've missed the goal.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.720]   And in verse five, it tells us the goal of everything
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.320]   and the truth is love.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.640]   So how do we experience,
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   how is it possible that we can have this true understanding?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.120]   'Cause I mean, okay, now we have established
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.960]   a true understanding is important.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.440]   We need to know the meaning and the goal behind everything.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.700]   But how is it that we can achieve it?
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.600]   Well, if we look at the false teacher and Paul,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.080]   what is their greatest difference?
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.040]   I mean, what's the difference between them,
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.800]   these false teachers and Apostle Paul?
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.240]   What's the difference?
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:32.320]   Well, the difference is that Paul had experienced this truth
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.840]   and the false teacher did not.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.680]   What does it mean to experience something?
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.240]   Well, it's kind of like,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.280]   what if you had to explain to someone
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.120]   what it's like to swim?
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.540]   And if you've never swam yourself,
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.920]   you might've heard about what it is
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.200]   so you can tell them all the correct description about it.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.800]   Oh, swimming is like this, it's like this, it's like this.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.640]   But then even as you're seeing it,
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.840]   you don't truly understand what it feels like to swim
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.280]   unless you go and get into the water
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.460]   and you start like moving your arms
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.440]   and allow that water to splash your head.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   And in the same way,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.760]   the truth cannot be fully understood
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.680]   unless we've experienced it.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.160]   Now, I don't wanna say that any kind of experience
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.040]   that you have make that a truth, okay?
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.740]   Just because you've experienced something
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.640]   and it has worked for you, it doesn't mean it's a truth.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.540]   But if it is truth and the gospel,
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.760]   the salvation of our Jesus Christ, our Lord is true,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.040]   then we should and we need to experience it.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.640]   And that's when it's real to us.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.700]   That's when we have conviction
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.120]   and that's where we will gain true understanding.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.280]   And so here it brings us,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.400]   and here it brings us to an important part,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.320]   which is unless we have true experience of the truth,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.580]   we will always stay at just the surface level
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.320]   of understanding it.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.840]   So we must get ourselves wet,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.000]   we must get into the water
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.480]   and truly experience this truth.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.100]   And so in here, in verse 14,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:27.100]   when Paul had experiences for his own,
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.780]   for his personal firsthand experience,
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.060]   this is what he said,
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.660]   "The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly,
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.500]   along with the faith and the love that are in Christ Jesus."
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.660]   Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.700]   "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.160]   of whom I am the worst."
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:57.040]   Now, you see, he could not fully understand this statement
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.720]   until he himself was shown grace.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.080]   And in order that he would be shown grace,
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.080]   it's a very crucial enlightenment that he must have,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.960]   which is that he is a sinner.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.720]   And in here, he clearly says, "Of whom I am the worst."
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.360]   And you see, because he saw how much sins he had,
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.160]   he was able to comprehend,
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.320]   to experience the amount of grace
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.680]   he also received from the Lord.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   And so if we have only experienced a little bit of sin,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.920]   well, we can only experience a little bit of his mercy.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.360]   And maybe that's our problem.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.760]   I mean, how many of you here,
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.720]   you can fully say that I am the worst of all sinners?
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.840]   Put up your hand if there's one out there.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.640]   Oh, there's one hand.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.800]   Oh, there's another one.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   There's another one, maybe here and there.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.860]   But you know, we're somehow like,
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.480]   we don't even wanna go all the way, right?
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.720]   We're like, yeah, kind of.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.240]   You know, there's always someone worse than me.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.640]   You know, I can't, I don't know if I'm the worst.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.880]   And I'm not saying that, you know,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.280]   go out and do something bad
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.080]   so you are the worst after you repent, okay?
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.560]   It's not my point.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.840]   But my point is maybe our problem
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.520]   is that we don't really think we're that bad.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.160]   I mean, we haven't killed anybody.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.940]   I hope, okay, if you did,
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.840]   I don't know if you should let me know, but okay.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.600]   We haven't, and we haven't stolen anything, hopefully.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.800]   And so it's hard for us to gauge.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.880]   I mean, we wanna love the Lord.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.000]   We know that we're sinners, but in our head,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.880]   but we don't really see ourselves that bad.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.840]   How are we gonna like receive that mercy and love
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.000]   that the Bible always talks about?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.960]   And that's kind of the same with me
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.120]   when my first two decades of my walk with the Lord,
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.880]   I know I look really young and I still am really young.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.960]   I mean, the first two decades of my walk,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.880]   and I believe when I was really extremely young,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.080]   the first two decades when I walked with the Lord,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.920]   I went to church, the Bible study,
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.720]   and I knew when I did the sinner's prayer
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.760]   and, but I just always felt that I'm not that bad.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.160]   And because of that, for the longest time,
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.120]   I can't really feel or experience
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.400]   the amount of love and mercy.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.620]   And it wasn't until that I was in a ditch
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.880]   that I prayed to the Lord, Lord, please show me the truth.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.320]   And I didn't even know what the truth is.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.480]   I just did that prayer.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.320]   And I believe that it was the Holy Spirit then
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.520]   who opened my eyes and, you know,
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.240]   like I believe it was a few days later and I was like,
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.800]   oh my God, I actually saw myself.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.400]   I was like, I didn't know I was this prideful,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.760]   but all of a sudden I saw it.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.160]   And I didn't know that I was that boastful
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.560]   or I didn't know I was still selfish
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.120]   and everything was about me.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.040]   And, and, you know, in the Bible,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.840]   it says that you don't have to kill someone
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.700]   in order to commit that sin.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.260]   Even if you hate it, you're brothers,
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.360]   you're already liable to it.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.560]   So what he's really saying is our sinful nature.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.880]   So you don't have to kill anybody to do that,
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.360]   but we can't really see it
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.000]   until Holy Spirit shows it to us.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.120]   And so if you feel like, you know,
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.940]   oh, I've understood the gospel so many years,
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.880]   but I don't really sense the mercy
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   or the love that God has.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.040]   I know his love.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.800]   I don't say that you don't know,
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.280]   but I don't experience it.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.960]   And then I really urge you to pray that prayer
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.120]   where you ask God, show me the truth,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.840]   show me who I am so that I could see who you are.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   And that's exactly what happened to Paul,
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   that he saw how Jesus had abundantly poured out
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.240]   his grace to him when he saw
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.080]   that he was the worst of sinners.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.160]   So let us really experience, jump in if you haven't,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.520]   'cause I feel like we might be here
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.560]   like dipping our toes into the pool,
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.960]   but not really like jumping in.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.420]   That's what we need to do.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:13.300]   And so having said that, he continues on,
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.680]   and he really tells us
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:21.840]   that as we are holding onto this truth,
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.120]   something changes inside of us.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.320]   And he becomes so sure that he says,
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.520]   this statement is trustworthy.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.460]   This is a full acceptance
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.540]   because he had experienced it for himself.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:47.300]   And so I just wanted to say that for him,
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.640]   this gospel for Paul has been entrusted to him.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:59.280]   And he says in verse 22,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.760]   I'm trying to find where my verse went.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.520]   Now he said in verse 16,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.080]   "But for that very reason, I was shown mercy
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.560]   so that in me, the worst of sinners,
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.800]   Christ Jesus might displace his immense patience
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.560]   as an example.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever."
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   This is an important turnaround
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.960]   because he sees that the purpose for him
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   to understand the truth, to experience it,
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.140]   there's only one reason,
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.140]   and that is so Christ Jesus may be displayed in him.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.000]   This is for the purpose.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.720]   And he sees it because this has been entrusted to him.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.200]   And it has been entrusted to us as well.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.040]   And this brings us to our third point,
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.800]   which is when we uphold the truth,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.680]   we need to be true vessels of it.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.080]   Now, Paul is a true vessel because he had experienced it.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.520]   And now he knows that it's been passed on to him.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.840]   And every day he lives it out.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.520]   And I don't know about you.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.460]   Do you think you live out this truth every day?
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.460]   Does your life, does your decision center around this truth?
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.620]   And what is the truth that he says?
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.440]   That Christ Jesus came to save sinners.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.480]   Do you center your life around that
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.840]   so that other people can see God in you?
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   Now, for those that don't,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:01.240]   I believe that there's something that God's calling us to do
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.560]   which is to be his true vessels.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.080]   Now, sometimes we think, well, how do I do that?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.420]   Because I mean, all I do is I wake up every day,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.400]   I go to school, I go to work, and then I eat my dinner,
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.960]   and then I sleep, and I spend time with my friends
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.360]   and family, and what does it look like?
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.660]   How am I supposed to live out this truth
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.240]   that Jesus Christ came to die for sinners?
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.560]   How do I do that?
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.560]   Well, I wanna show you like an everyday life example.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.560]   So a few days ago, I was going to Hot Pot,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.580]   I was trying to bring my mom to a Hot Pot in Causeway Bay.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.480]   So we're going, talking, having a great time,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.220]   and then as we got there,
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.160]   you know how MTR stations are, right?
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.080]   There's 100 exits, and you're like, oh my goodness,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.680]   which one should I go, right?
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.100]   Of course, I was attempting to exit the one
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.380]   that's closest to the restaurant,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.920]   of which I did not choose
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.240]   because I've mistakenly exit another one.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.780]   And so I was there with my mom and she's walking out there,
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.180]   you know, it's 35 degrees,
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.720]   we were both sweating a little bit,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.740]   and you know, extra five minutes outdoor.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.060]   And then she turns to me and then she said,
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.220]   you know, if you don't know where you're going,
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.080]   just let me know.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.560]   And then she's like, you have no sense of direction anyways.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.420]   And then she's saying, okay, you know,
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.900]   last time when you were trying to bring me to Disneyland,
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.580]   and we were already in Kowloon,
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.540]   I brought her to Central, and then I brought her back.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.980]   And then the other time we were in like Korea,
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.560]   and then she's like, you made me walk in circles, you know?
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.240]   And I wanted to say at that point,
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.480]   I realized that I was flushing a bit.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.680]   And then I realized, oh, you know,
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.720]   all I wanted to do was to take you to lunch, you know?
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.300]   And I felt like that I needed some grace.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.420]   And it was in that moment that I realized, you know what?
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.900]   We can actually show grace to the people around us
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.480]   with the smallest things possible.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.180]   We can show them how it is that Christ Jesus
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.460]   had died for sinners.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.260]   And you're like, whoa, isn't this a far fetch?
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.240]   But imagine that day if you had just said nothing
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.500]   or said, hey, you know, it's a nice walk out,
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.140]   look at these stores, I haven't seen them some time.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.700]   It would have been very different.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.300]   And I don't wanna pick on my mom, which I just did.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.540]   But I wanna say that happens to me all the time as well.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.220]   So my mom calls when I'm preparing this sermon,
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.300]   and I'm like, mom, can you just get off the phone?
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.300]   And I wanted to show her no patience, you know?
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.380]   I'm like, I'm working on this,
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.540]   like take care of your own problems.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.460]   Or this other time when someone has wronged me,
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.380]   and then I'm trying to WhatsApp another person.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.340]   Hey, you know, guess what that person did?
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.420]   It's so wrong.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.700]   And I even screen captured it, you know,
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.220]   screenshot our conversation.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.740]   And I realized, what, I'm just being so judgmental
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.300]   at that time.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.920]   That is not what the truth is.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.300]   And just when I, you know, going through these,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.080]   I was like, it's not the big things.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.660]   I mean, yes, also the big things,
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.900]   but it's also the small things.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.540]   And maybe that's why a lot of non-believers
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.980]   call Christians hypocrites,
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.020]   because you say your God's this way,
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.660]   but I'm not experienced Him like that through you.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.860]   But imagine if every day, the little things that we do,
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.420]   that we display Christ Jesus,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.820]   we display this truth in our lives.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.460]   Would they not turn to Christ and say,
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.700]   what is this God that you believe?
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.900]   And then what made that look like in a workplace?
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.280]   I mean, there might be a coworker,
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.180]   which you hate inside of you,
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.740]   but I'm sure you're forgiving him already.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.380]   And he goes and makes a big mistake.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.100]   What is it that you would do?
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.240]   Would you go and rub it in?
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.420]   Or would you graciously give him a hand?
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.420]   And like, what if like your wife nags you for the 10th time?
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.620]   Oh, this is something that's really bothering me.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.420]   What do you do?
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:15.580]   Do you like patiently listens to her cry and respond?
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.140]   Or do you just say, (speaks in foreign language)
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.420]   or just like, oh, it's annoying.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.380]   What do you do?
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.620]   What do we do?
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.020]   And what do we need to do?
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.020]   And God tells us, be true vessels of the truth.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.560]   And really, I don't know,
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.560]   maybe it's because we don't fully understand the gospel.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.720]   Maybe we haven't experienced the mercy
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.400]   so we can't give mercy to others.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.060]   I don't know what it is.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.480]   Or maybe it can just be like me
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   where I forgot to uphold it and just slipped.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.840]   But whatever it is, God tells us
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.360]   that we are to uphold the truth
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.640]   and we are to be his vessels.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.440]   And that's what Paul does.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.620]   He has entrusted, or God has entrusted the gospel to him
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.800]   and he had been faithful.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.580]   Would we too be faithful?
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:24.480]   Now, the truth is that Jesus Christ came to the world
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.000]   to save sinners.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.960]   Would you and I be willing to have our lives
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.120]   work around it so that we're constantly displaying
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.920]   Jesus Christ to others around us?
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.480]   And even though when we were broken,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.680]   Jesus came and he gathered us, he accepted us,
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.680]   he shown us mercy, he forgave us and made us whole.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.660]   Would you be willing to display that same love to others?
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.940]   So if you don't, if you feel like,
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.180]   oh, I don't really fully understand,
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:13.540]   I don't really fully experienced his mercy and love,
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.960]   please pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.420]   enlightens you to your sins.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.020]   Then you will see the mercy
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.780]   and be able to let that flow out.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.660]   If you already understood everything
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.620]   and then experienced it,
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:33.380]   then let us live that out in our everyday lives
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.380]   because all of this is actually for one purpose.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.480]   And that is so the eternal King,
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.260]   the invisible God would be given glory and honor.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.420]   Let us pray together.
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:54.220]   Dear heavenly Father,
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.620]   thank you for giving us Jesus.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:02.660]   Thank you for showing us how much you love us,
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.980]   that while we were sinners,
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.980]   you already came for us to wash away our sins.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.980]   And maybe some of us here understood it in our head,
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.620]   but have not experienced it.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:22.620]   I pray, Father, that your Holy Spirit will open up our eyes
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.040]   so that we would see ourselves,
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.500]   so that we could see how much you love us.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.260]   And Father, we just pray
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.980]   that you will help us in our everyday life
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:38.980]   to be that vessel to show everyone
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.860]   in the big things and small things
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.780]   who it is that lives inside of us.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.520]   In Jesus Christ, and we pray, amen.
