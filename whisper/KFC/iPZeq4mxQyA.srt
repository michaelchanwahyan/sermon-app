1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,340
 - What an intro, that's amazing.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,880
 Just one more thing on the fast,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,720
 and you know I'm very excited about this fast.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,640
 There will be a three-day devotional,

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,100
 and Pastor Peter will write Thursday's devotional,

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,480
 Pastor Paul, Friday's, and I'll write Saturday's.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,800
 It'll be mailed to you this week,

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,360
 so if you're wondering what to do when you're not eating,

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,480
 there'll be a devotional there for you.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,320
 Good.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
 I can't tell you how excited I am to be preaching to you,

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,160
 rather than preaching to a camera this week.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,880
 I think there's something of God's timing in this.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,220
 I think this is a really important message

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,160
 for our church, for our city today,

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,440
 and it's not by chance.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,560
 A few weeks ago, I felt God impress on me,

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,560
 and it was this.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,160
 I believe God said to me, "Call a fast.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,920
 "Call a fast for the church,

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,560
 "and call a fast for the city."

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,320
 I found that actually God had actually been speaking

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,460
 to a number of other people across the city

25
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,960
 on this very, very same thing,

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,120
 and we were able to come together at very short notice,

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,120
 and actually so much of the city is fasting together

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,080
 at an important time for this.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,220
 The other thing I felt that God said to me was this.

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,020
 I want you to preach the book of Esther,

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,480
 and that's why we've got Esther tonight.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,780
 We'd actually planned a series in Judges,

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,500
 which we'll have next month,

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,900
 and I felt God also say,

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,140
 "Would you please tell them that they were born

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,280
 "for such a time as this?"

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,380
 And you've heard that expression quite a lot

38
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,420
 the last few months, but that comes from Esther 4.14,

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,620
 James will be preaching on it next week.

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,420
 So it's so important that we're doing this at this time,

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,120
 and we're doing this together.

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,500
 So why are we looking at Esther?

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,800
 Well, the book of Esther is very counter-cultural.

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,700
 The book of Esther is a book about social justice,

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,440
 social justice actually done by a woman,

46
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,480
 social justice in a hostile society.

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,420
 It reminds us, doesn't it, of being in Hong Kong

48
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,860
 for such a time as this, 2020.

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,380
 So what I did, I immersed myself in the book of Esther,

50
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,780
 and I wanna just honour here some of the people

51
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,580
 that I used in my research

52
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,140
 'cause they're particular favourites of mine,

53
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,340
 Mark Driscoll, Warren Wearsby,

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,860
 and especially one of my all-time favourite preachers,

55
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,940
 Tim Keller of Redeemer Church in New York City,

56
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,280
 whom I had the privilege to meet here in Hong Kong

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,680
 at the FCC for breakfast about 10 years ago.

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,620
 His teaching on Esther has been a great help

59
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,580
 in piecing together this series,

60
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,380
 and we have leaned heavily on him

61
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,700
 at the same time as adding our own flavour.

62
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,420
 You may have remembered in January,

63
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,620
 it was a long time ago, January,

64
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,340
 when we were actually doing church in January,

65
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,460
 we did a series on Ephesians, on identity,

66
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,140
 and the founding pastor of Mars Hill, Mark Driscoll,

67
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,140
 wrote a book which all of our staff read together.

68
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,620
 He makes five points, five unique things

69
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,620
 about Esther and the book of Esther.

70
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,180
 And he says this, "Esther is a stunning story.

71
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,660
 "The book of Esther has all the features

72
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,940
 "of a typical James Bond movie."

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,780
 Now, you know the James Bond movie was postponed.

74
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,820
 Well, the book of Esther has not been postponed.

75
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,440
 So everything you would have got in James Bond,

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,500
 you've got in Esther.

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,860
 It's a great plot.

78
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,900
 It's a beauty.

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,560
 There's a villain.

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,620
 There's action.

81
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,580
 There's death.

82
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,540
 And the hero wins in the end.

83
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,780
 Actually, a heroine.

84
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,700
 "Like a Bond movie, it has some amazingly complex

85
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,560
 "and intriguing characters.

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,800
 "From the godlike Xerxes,

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,800
 "to Esther, the orphan girl raised by her cousin Mordecai,

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,140
 "and the scoundrel Haman."

89
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,300
 Now, I want a favour.

90
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,200
 This is what you've got to remember for the next four weeks.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,740
 Every time I mention the word Haman,

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,640
 I want you to boo.

93
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,100
 Right?

94
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,800
 So let's have a little trial at this one, okay?

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,900
 It sounds even better through the masks.

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,540
 The scoundrel Haman.

97
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,380
 We're getting there.

98
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,460
 You simply cannot beat the characters in this cast.

99
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,680
 Second thing is that Esther is painfully normal.

100
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,860
 She grows up in a very lukewarm religious home

101
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,160
 as an orphan raised by her cousin.

102
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,100
 She was beautiful,

103
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,020
 but she allows men to tend to her needs

104
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,360
 and makes her decisions.

105
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,540
 Her behaviour, as we're gonna see tonight, is sinful.

106
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,580
 And she spends around a year in the spa

107
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,600
 getting dolled up to lose her virginity

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,300
 with the pagan king,

109
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,300
 at the same time as hundreds of other women.

110
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,940
 She performs so well

111
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,100
 that he chooses her as his favourite.

112
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,820
 We could actually say she shows no character

113
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,720
 until her own neck is on the line.

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,780
 And then we see her gloriously rise up

115
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,600
 to save the life of her people.

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,660
 Number three, quite strangely,

117
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,900
 the book of Esther has been quite widely avoided.

118
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,920
 I read that there was zero commentaries on the book

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,180
 that were published in the first seven centuries

120
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,500
 of the Christian church.

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,920
 As far as we can tell,

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,520
 John Calvin never preached from Esther

123
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,060
 and Martin Luther despised it.

124
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,500
 Very few preachers in the history of the church

125
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,740
 and more recent years have touched this book.

126
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,080
 Number four is that Esther has been greatly misinterpreted.

127
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,960
 Feminists have tried to cast Esther's life

128
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,960
 as a tragic tale of male domination and female liberation.

129
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,360
 Many evangelicals have ignored her sexual sin

130
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,980
 and godless behaviour

131
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,700
 and made her into a Daniel-like figure,

132
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,000
 which is inaccurate.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,300
 Some have even tried to tie her story

134
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,760
 into the modern day sex slave trafficking

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,400
 as she was brought before the powerful king

136
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
 as part of his harem.

137
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,040
 What's the truth?

138
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,920
 We will see this over the next four weeks.

139
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,760
 And fifthly, Esther is a godless book.

140
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,340
 God is never mentioned in the book.

141
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,020
 Esther is not mentioned anywhere else in the Bible.

142
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,320
 No one prays, no miracles happen.

143
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,960
 God never shows up in any way.

144
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,980
 But as we will see, God is throughout the book

145
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,420
 like a silhouette.

146
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,740
 He works throughout the book,

147
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,500
 not through his visible hand of miracle,

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,940
 but rather his invisible hand of providence.

149
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,060
 I wanna give you an invitation today.

150
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,660
 I would invite you this week or the next few weeks

151
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,040
 to read the book of Esther.

152
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,600
 Read or listen to it.

153
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,300
 I timed it.

154
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,580
 It will take you less than 30 minutes.

155
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,820
 Can I make a suggestion that during the fast,

156
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,500
 instead of doing Facebook, you read the book of Esther.

157
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,300
 If you read it this week,

158
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,600
 you will get so much more out of this series.

159
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,820
 But what I'm gonna do anyway,

160
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,020
 I'm gonna give you the nine minute version.

161
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,820
 Esther's story begins in 483 BC,

162
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,180
 103 years after Nebuchadnezzar

163
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,060
 had taken the Jews into captivity.

164
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,600
 Esther lived in the kingdom of Persia,

165
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,220
 the dominant kingdom of the Middle East,

166
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,320
 following the fall of Babylon in 539 BC.

167
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,940
 Esther was a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin.

168
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,340
 That's very, very important.

169
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,740
 The name Esther actually means star.

170
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,240
 Is anybody called Esther here?

171
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,980
 Esther actually means star.

172
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,180
 She was also known as Hadassah, which means myrtle.

173
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,460
 Myrtle branches signify peace and thanksgiving.

174
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,000
 Esther first appears in Esther chapter two.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,600
 She's an orphan Jew brought up by her cousin Mordecai.

176
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,980
 The book of Esther teaches much more

177
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
 than the life of one lady.

178
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,700
 There are five main characters in this book.

179
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,060
 King Xerxes, Queen Vashti, Mordecai,

180
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,060
 Mordecai, Esther, and wait for it, Haman.

181
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:42,460
 As you read the story,

182
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,300
 make sure you understand the roles of these five characters.

183
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,380
 So very quickly, in chapter one,

184
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,580
 King Xerxes decides to display his abundant wealth

185
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,900
 for 180 days, followed by a seven-day feast,

186
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,260
 a lavish display of his power.

187
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,100
 Now, why?

188
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,620
 He was planning to invade Greece,

189
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,260
 and the display was to demonstrate

190
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,380
 that he had sufficient wealth to carry it.

191
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,740
 As one of the world's wealthiest men,

192
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,620
 the Persian king would love to display his wealth.

193
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,220
 And there is a legend that he even wore gemstones

194
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,120
 in his beard.

195
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,380
 On the seventh day of the feast,

196
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,540
 King Xerxes calls Queen Vashti

197
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,920
 in order to display her beauty to the people.

198
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,780
 She refuses to come.

199
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,780
 And is eventually banished from the king's presence for life.

200
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,400
 So a new queen is sought.

201
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,060
 In chapter two, we read that Esther is chosen to be queen.

202
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,220
 She goes through the normal 12 months of beauty treatment

203
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,720
 before meeting the king.

204
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,660
 Chapter two actually also records the good deed of Mordecai

205
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,020
 in saving the king's life by alerting him

206
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,100
 of an assassination attempt on his life.

207
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,860
 We read that the deed is recorded in the record books,

208
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,000
 and this later serves as a blessing for Mordecai.

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,340
 In chapter three, Haman,

210
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,920
 that was pretty, getting pretty weak now.

211
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,900
 In chapter three, Haman is honored by the king

212
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,180
 and given a high position in the kingdom.

213
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,460
 Haman is annoyed.

214
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,220
 He's annoyed with Mordecai

215
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,220
 because Mordecai refuses to kneel down to him.

216
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:09,780
 Haman, his anger leads him to plot the execution

217
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,080
 of all the Jews in the kingdom.

218
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,980
 Now, in order to prevent the execution of all the Jews,

219
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,980
 Mordecai calls on Esther to intercede to the king.

220
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,020
 There's a problem here.

221
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,960
 The king doesn't know that Esther is a Jew.

222
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:38,740
 Esther has no idea how the king will respond to the news.

223
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,340
 So she's a little bit reluctant.

224
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,080
 And Esther's reluctance to approach the king

225
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,900
 is met with stern words from Mordecai in chapter four.

226
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,540
 Chapter 4, 14, you're gonna hear this again next week.

227
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,380
 He says this,

228
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,740
 "For if you keep silent at this time,

229
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,860
 relief and deliverance will rise

230
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
 for the Jews from another place,

231
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,540
 but you and your father's house will perish.

232
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,020
 And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom

233
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,340
 for such a time as this."

234
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,740
 For such a time as this is a theme of the series.

235
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,460
 Sorry, I hope that's God on the phone, by the way.

236
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,900
 Otherwise, maybe turn it off.

237
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,180
 You're taking a telephone, yeah, thank you.

238
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,640
 For such a time of this is the theme of this series.

239
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,120
 Now, why have I said that?

240
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,780
 You are not here in Hong Kong in 2020 by chance.

241
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,420
 Whether you're here for a week,

242
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,460
 whether you're going back to China on Tuesday,

243
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,860
 whether you're here for a year,

244
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,980
 whether you're here for 10 years,

245
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,060
 whether you're here for the rest of your life,

246
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,340
 God has you here for a purpose.

247
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,180
 And I can say to you that you were born

248
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,120
 for such a time as this.

249
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,260
 So Esther eventually agrees to appeal to the king.

250
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,900
 Prior to this, she asked Mordecai

251
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,440
 to organise a time of fasting for her.

252
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,300
 She is well aware that she needs God's favour

253
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,440
 if she is to succeed.

254
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,820
 In chapter five, Esther approaches the king

255
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,740
 and invites him and Haman to a banquet.

256
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:12,060
 This is an attempt to get the timing right.

257
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,060
 Before she informs the king about Haman's

258
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,740
 (congregation exclaims)

259
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,760
 plot to kill the Jews of which she has won.

260
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,580
 Esther had hid the fact that she was a Jew

261
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,380
 from the king on Mordecai's advice.

262
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,820
 Meanwhile, Haman's

263
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,620
 (congregation exclaims)

264
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,340
 hatred for Mordecai is growing.

265
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,740
 And on the advice of his friends and wife,

266
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,540
 he has special gallows prepared besides his house

267
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,540
 on which to hang Mordecai.

268
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,540
 In chapter six, God moves to save the Jews.

269
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:00,860
 The king cannot sleep and asked for the record books

270
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,700
 to be read aloud to him.

271
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,580
 Remember I mentioned the record books at the beginning?

272
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,340
 The deeds of Mordecai in saving the king

273
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,140
 in the past are read out.

274
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,220
 In this extraordinary change of events,

275
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,860
 the king asked Haman

276
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,540
 (congregation exclaims)

277
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,380
 a question.

278
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,860
 What should be done to a man who the king wants to honor?

279
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:35,340
 Haman in his arrogance thinks the king is referring to him

280
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,980
 and advises, oh, I'd put on a lavish display of wealth

281
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,360
 and honor to be bestowed on this person publicly.

282
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,460
 The king orders Haman

283
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,660
 to do this to Mordecai.

284
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,740
 In chapter seven, Esther reveals to the king

285
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,340
 that she is a Jew and that Haman

286
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,540
 has plotted to kill them all.

287
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,540
 Haman is hanged on his own gallows.

288
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,380
 I think we have a cheer for that one.

289
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,700
 (congregation exclaims)

290
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,260
 In chapter eight, nine and 10,

291
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,260
 all the Jews are saved and Haman's family are killed.

292
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,620
 (congregation laughs)

293
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,200
 Wow, are you booing for Haman or booing they were killed?

294
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,740
 It should be half booing and half cheering really.

295
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,180
 All I can say is wow.

296
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,480
 It's hard to choose where to read it,

297
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,940
 which is why I'm saying to you,

298
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,900
 read it all at home this week.

299
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,140
 I've chosen a few verses from chapter two.

300
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,740
 I'm gonna read them to you now.

301
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,020
 Now there was in the citadel of Susa,

302
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,740
 a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai.

303
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,220
 Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah,

304
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,260
 whom he had brought up

305
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,540
 because she had neither father or mother.

306
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,480
 This young woman who was also known as Esther

307
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,260
 had a lovely figure and was beautiful.

308
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,020
 Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter

309
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,300
 when her father and mother died.

310
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,060
 When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed,

311
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,620
 many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa

312
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,680
 and put under the care of Hergai.

313
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,140
 Esther also was taken to the king's palace

314
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,240
 and entrusted to Hergai, who had charge of the harem.

315
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,440
 She pleased him and won his favor.

316
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,080
 Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments

317
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,720
 and special food.

318
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,120
 He assigned to her seven female attendants

319
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,080
 selected from the king's palace

320
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
 and moved her and her attendants

321
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,840
 into the best place in the harem.

322
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,440
 Esther had not revealed her nationality

323
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,280
 and family background

324
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,880
 because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.

325
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,500
 Then we move on.

326
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,040
 She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence

327
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,600
 in the 10th month, the month of Tebeth

328
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,320
 in the seventh year of his reign.

329
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,960
 Now the king was attracted to Esther

330
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
 more than any of the other women,

331
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,640
 and she won his favor and approval

332
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,560
 more than any of the other virgins.

333
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,440
 So he set a royal crown on her head

334
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,360
 and made her queen instead of Vashti.

335
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,920
 And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet,

336
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,040
 for all his nobles and officials.

337
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,600
 He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces

338
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,960
 and distributed gifts with royal liberality.

339
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,040
 When the virgins were assembled a second time,

340
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,040
 Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.

341
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,760
 But Esther had kept secret

342
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,240
 her family background and nationality,

343
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,200
 just as Mordecai had told her to do so.

344
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,520
 For she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions

345
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,720
 as she had done when he was bringing her up.

346
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,200
 During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate,

347
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,520
 Bithana and Teresh, two of the king's officers

348
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,960
 who guided the doorway, became angry

349
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,800
 and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.

350
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,320
 But Mordecai found out about the plot

351
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,960
 and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king,

352
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,880
 giving credit to Mordecai.

353
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,440
 And when the report was investigated and found to be true,

354
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,280
 the two officials were impaled on poles.

355
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,120
 All this was recorded in the book of the annals

356
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,940
 of the presence of the king.

357
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,760
 Now, why have I chosen these verses?

358
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,560
 Well, firstly, as I said,

359
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,720
 the Jews were living in dispersion in Persia.

360
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,440
 A religious minority living at a culture

361
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,620
 at variance with its values.

362
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,400
 Can you think of somewhere else like that?

363
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
 21st century Hong Kong.

364
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,080
 Hong Kong, less than 10% people who claim to be Christians,

365
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,780
 where our culture is money, power, and position.

366
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,020
 How do you do this?

367
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:40,980
 How do you live in a culture which is at variance

368
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,200
 to the values that we hold?

369
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,040
 Number one, do you try and withdraw and stay pure?

370
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
 Do you go into lockdown?

371
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,440
 Do you become monastic?

372
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,940
 That's not practical.

373
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,140
 Do you try and keep your views private, silent?

374
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,860
 That's not right.

375
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,140
 Do you criticise everything?

376
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,540
 Do you protest about everything?

377
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,900
 That's not gracious.

378
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:20,600
 Secondly, this was a male dominated society

379
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 in which a woman becomes a major vehicle for social justice.

380
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,280
 And praise God, in the 21st century,

381
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,040
 we're at long last seeing women raised up as leaders

382
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,880
 around the world.

383
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,120
 And it's interesting that the countries

384
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,060
 with the best record of COVID-19 have all got women leaders.

385
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,260
 I don't know if that's a coincidence or not.

386
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,600
 Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson should watch that.

387
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,800
 Thirdly, it teaches us how to follow God

388
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 in a morally, spiritually, and culturally ambiguous society

389
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,440
 when you don't know what to do.

390
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,640
 What we're gonna learn this evening is this,

391
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,400
 is that God is always at work in spite of appearances.

392
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,400
 Secondly, we're gonna learn that for the world,

393
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,460
 appearances are all that matter.

394
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,400
 And thirdly, we're gonna learn how God's work

395
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,760
 can free us from the world's ways.

396
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,840
 So back to chapter one,

397
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,680
 King Xerxes has a grand banquet for all the males.

398
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,680
 I guess today we'd call it a stag party.

399
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
 And he gets very drunk.

400
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,160
 Verse eight tells us that the party

401
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,760
 was an all you can drink, a wine buffet.

402
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,880
 At some point, he decides he's gonna show off to the stags

403
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,560
 the beauty of his queen Vashti.

404
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,240
 She gets a summons, come, dress beautifully

405
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,840
 and stand before thousands of drunken men.

406
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,880
 Would you fancy that?

407
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,920
 Some sources even suggest that she may have been pregnant

408
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,040
 at the time with Artaxerxes, who was a future king.

409
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,520
 But it became a major diplomatic incident,

410
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,300
 a national crisis.

411
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:28,440
 She showed amazing bravery in a hierarchical society

412
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,480
 where there was a culture of honour.

413
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,160
 She caused the king to lose face.

414
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,380
 Have you heard that expression before?

415
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,080
 Face is a very big thing here in Hong Kong.

416
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,040
 And the result was she was stripped of her title

417
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,160
 and she was banished.

418
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,880
 Let's find another queen.

419
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,480
 It's a little bit symptomatic of the 21st century,

420
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,700
 isn't it?

421
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,480
 Our culture, if one thing doesn't work,

422
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,440
 we throw it away and get something new.

423
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,880
 Now, Persian kings not only collected vast amounts

424
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,520
 of jewellery, but also great numbers of women.

425
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,960
 His attendants go and find the most beautiful ladies

426
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
 in the whole empire.

427
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,020
 They bring them all, maybe a thousand,

428
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,280
 and they undergo a complete makeover

429
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,600
 for one night with the king.

430
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,440
 And there were four possible outcomes.

431
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,040
 Number one, he didn't like them.

432
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,860
 They became concubines, but he never went to them.

433
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,660
 But they weren't allowed to go home.

434
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,340
 They weren't allowed to find someone else.

435
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,440
 They were banished to widowhood.

436
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,960
 Number two, he liked them.

437
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,060
 They became concubines and he went to them occasionally.

438
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:06,180
 Number three, if you're really lucky,

439
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,500
 you're in the top three.

440
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,580
 He would marry them and their kids would become heirs.

441
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,340
 And number four, really, really, really, really lucky.

442
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:25,880
 If you were number one, the number one would become queen.

443
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,980
 Now, a friend encouraged a Jewish orphan called Esther,

444
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,780
 brought up by her cousin Mordecai to apply.

445
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,580
 Mordecai instructs her to say nothing of her race.

446
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,400
 It would surely ruin her chances.

447
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,500
 So she kept stum.

448
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,760
 She went for beauty treatment and training.

449
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,300
 Her turn came eventually for her to visit him.

450
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,700
 And he liked her the best.

451
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,980
 The announcement was made.

452
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,900
 She would become a queen

453
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,160
 and a big marriage banquet was arranged.

454
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,340
 The headline would be something like this.

455
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,980
 I'll put it on the screen.

456
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,880
 A little orphan Jewish girl becomes queen

457
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,540
 of the greatest empire on earth.

458
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,960
 But look what the background to all this was.

459
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,100
 The Jews were in great danger.

460
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,200
 They could be taken out at a moment's notice.

461
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,800
 And the story behind Esther is this.

462
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,200
 When God sees this, he always responds dramatically.

463
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,880
 There are many examples of this in scripture.

464
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,680
 The 10 plagues, the pillar of fire,

465
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,340
 the parting of the Red Sea that we sang about earlier.

466
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,080
 As I said, there's no mention of God here.

467
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,800
 It has been said that the book of Esther

468
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,660
 is a record of wonders without a miracle.

469
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,360
 It's obvious here that God's plan unfolded here,

470
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,000
 not by a miracle, a dream or a vision,

471
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,540
 but by a series of consequences.

472
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,660
 If the king had not got drunk, Vashti stays.

473
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,720
 Esther doesn't become queen and save the Jews.

474
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,420
 What if Esther wasn't pretty?

475
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:33,240
 What if Mordecai didn't eavesdrop on two guys

476
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,000
 who were plotting an assassination of the king?

477
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,680
 Mordecai wasn't honored at that time,

478
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,600
 but if he was, the Jews wouldn't have been saved.

479
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,740
 Instead, his deeds were recorded in a book.

480
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,840
 Store that one for a couple of weeks.

481
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,640
 Ordinary things, not like the 10 plagues

482
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,280
 or the parting of the Red Sea.

483
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,360
 So for example, Xerxes getting drunk,

484
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,040
 was it just a coincidence?

485
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,440
 God was at work.

486
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,400
 And God is at work in your life.

487
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,340
 His silence is not his absence.

488
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,720
 His hiddenness is not abandonment.

489
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,800
 God doesn't care about appearance.

490
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:43,440
 21st century Hong Kong, we're obsessed with appearance.

491
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,200
 The banquet lasted 180 days.

492
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,480
 He gets all his treasure paraded before his friends.

493
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,800
 Show off, look what I've got.

494
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,360
 Oh, we can be a bit like that.

495
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,800
 And in chapter two, the scene shifts

496
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,020
 to an international beauty pageant.

497
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,440
 Miss Universe or Persian Idol, maybe.

498
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,400
 In Persian culture, the most important thing about a man

499
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,120
 was his wealth and power.

500
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,080
 The most important thing about a woman

501
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,500
 was her sexual and physical beauty.

502
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,040
 Aren't you glad we don't live like that?

503
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,760
 On the surface, we say it's awful

504
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,200
 that the king had a thousand concubines.

505
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,180
 Disgusting.

506
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,760
 We don't do that now.

507
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:46,840
 Church, it is exactly the same now.

508
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,800
 The world is the same today.

509
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,160
 The world is like King Xerxes.

510
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,760
 The world says externals mean more than your character.

511
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,940
 The color of your skin.

512
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,040
 And in Hong Kong, the money in your bank account,

513
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,220
 the apartment you live in, the car you drive

514
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,400
 is more important than your character.

515
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:21,560
 What you have is more important than who you are.

516
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,320
 We all have to have our own type of beauty treatment.

517
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,400
 You go through this and we'll love you.

518
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,320
 Hong Kong parents say you get straight A's.

519
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,920
 I'll love you more than if you get C's.

520
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,020
 They may not say that, but they imply that.

521
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:51,160
 Are you a concubine to the world's sexiest man?

522
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,440
 Are you a concubine to the world's systems

523
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,360
 and the world's values?

524
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,440
 Have you sold out to the world's values?

525
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,320
 Is your choice of career based on,

526
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,140
 your friendships based on,

527
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,920
 the way you behave based on the world's values?

528
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,420
 Don't say, not me.

529
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,880
 I mean, some people are extreme examples.

530
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,920
 They're easy to spot.

531
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,680
 They're obsessed with these things.

532
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,280
 But make no mistake, the rest of us are affected.

533
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,340
 People in careers that they hate, but they love the status.

534
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,440
 People with eating disorders

535
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,040
 because every Hollywood idol they see,

536
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,160
 every model uses an advertisement is a size zero.

537
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,220
 All of us are affected.

538
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,660
 Which leads me to the question,

539
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,080
 the first two chapters are over.

540
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,880
 How has Esther been doing?

541
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
 What is her midterm report?

542
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,680
 The answer is she's blown it.

543
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:00,440
 When I said the feminists, they're disgusted with Esther.

544
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,100
 They love Vashti.

545
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,440
 She stood up to the chauvinistic king.

546
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,640
 Esther gets there, gets to the top by compliance.

547
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,320
 She listened to Mordecai.

548
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,140
 She's everything that Hergay, the king's unit asked.

549
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,500
 She becomes what we would call today a sex kitten.

550
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,460
 On the other hand,

551
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,640
 evangelicals, conservatives also think she failed.

552
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,460
 They compare her to Daniel and friends.

553
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,620
 They were Jews, but they followed the law.

554
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,180
 Esther doesn't declare her faith.

555
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,820
 She breaks dietary laws.

556
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,160
 She sleeps with a man that she's not married to.

557
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,700
 She marries an unbeliever.

558
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,300
 Gross violations of biblical law.

559
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:53,260
 But you may be saying, what else could she do?

560
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:59,440
 It's so much like 21st century Hong Kong.

561
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,440
 When we're looking for mates, husband and wives,

562
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,900
 what's our first cut?

563
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,200
 Our first cut, the world's values.

564
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,680
 Is he or she good looking, good personality, good career?

565
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,440
 And perhaps financially comfortable?

566
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,360
 And then and only then hope they have character.

567
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,820
 Are we concubines to the world?

568
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,780
 Are we selling ourselves for one night with the king?

569
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,200
 Doing all the Christian stuff, oh yeah.

570
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,340
 And what else?

571
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,460
 The truthful answer is yes.

572
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,300
 Esther got off to a terrible start.

573
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,940
 Thank goodness this is a four week series,

574
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,060
 not a one week series.

575
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,660
 You'll see by the end she has a brave heart.

576
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,740
 God stays with her, grows her, uses her,

577
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,180
 and makes her into a great woman of God.

578
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,200
 Many of us have made a bad start.

579
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,060
 I did.

580
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,140
 I wasn't born again until I was 30 years of age.

581
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,740
 Many of us here, even today, feel we've screwed up.

582
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,260
 We can't be used.

583
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,940
 I've got good news for you.

584
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,380
 The message of scripture is not that salvation

585
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,020
 is for the morally right,

586
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,760
 those who've led good squeaky clean lives.

587
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,140
 God persistently and consistently gives His grace

588
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,900
 to those who don't deserve it.

589
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,420
 That's why grace is amazing.

590
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,660
 That's why grace is amazing.

591
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,100
 Man looks at the outward appearance.

592
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,460
 God looks at the heart.

593
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,960
 We've got to stop judging the book by the cover.

594
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,420
 I guess I've got to give it a 21st century version.

595
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,500
 We've got to stop judging a book by its Amazon review,

596
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,340
 I suppose.

597
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:11,160
 When the world says, like Xerxes, I want to be your spouse,

598
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,660
 when it imposes its conditions,

599
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,340
 I say to you tonight in response to that,

600
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,580
 God wants to be your spouse.

601
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:26,660
 What sort of beauty treatment do we need to go through?

602
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,160
 Read the Bible cover to cover, pray three hours a day,

603
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,380
 attend Klan every week, become pastor of the church?

604
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,520
 No, no, no.

605
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,320
 Listen, Xerxes loved Esther because she was already beautiful.

606
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:52,980
 God loves you to make you beautiful.

607
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,760
 Can I say that again?

608
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,260
 Some people need to hear this.

609
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,260
 God loves you to make you beautiful.

610
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:07,800
 Esther had to give her life and freedom up for a king.

611
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,800
 Jesus Christ, who is a king, is the only spouse

612
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,440
 who gives up his life for you.

613
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,560
 By the way, guys, it says in the Bible,

614
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,680
 we have to love our wives as Jesus Christ loved the church

615
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,080
 and he gave his life for it.

616
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,400
 He became disfigured.

617
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,840
 He became ugly.

618
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,000
 Just watch the Passion of Christ movie.

619
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,140
 He became ugly.

620
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,420
 To make you beautiful.

621
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:47,660
 In conclusion, there are three things to help you get away

622
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:52,420
 from the world's concubinage, I don't know if that's

623
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,140
 even a word, concubinage, it sounds a good word.

624
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,840
 Score a lot of words on Scrabble.

625
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:05,840
 Number one is this, get a real definition of beauty.

626
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,240
 Not the world's yardstick.

627
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,240
 Real beauty is not self-obsession, but self-sacrifice.

628
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,240
 Tell yourself, I am beautiful, he has made me this way.

629
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,800
 Secondly, get a real experience of beauty.

630
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,400
 I always get a picture here of the, I do lots of weddings,

631
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,400
 there's a bride coming down the aisle and when the bride

632
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,680
 comes down the aisle, I like to watch the bridegroom

633
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,640
 and watch his face as the bride comes down the aisle.

634
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
 That's what your bridegroom, Jesus, thinks of you.

635
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,320
 And thirdly, live a life of greatness and live it now.

636
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,560
 I am convinced that there are esters in this congregation.

637
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,520
 Move on to the future that God has for you.

638
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,480
 I declare greatness over you.

639
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,240
 I'm gonna ask you to stand as the band comes back.

640
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,080
 I wanna declare some words over you.

641
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:29,600
 You need to receive this.

642
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,640
 I know you've got used to 20 minute sermons online,

643
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,040
 this is a bit longer today.

644
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,360
 There's a lot in there, but you need to,

645
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,120
 just for the next minute, listen to what I'm gonna say.

646
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,840
 This is God talking to you.

647
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:56,440
 Oh yes, I shaped you first inside, then out.

648
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,400
 I formed you in your mother's womb.

649
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,360
 Body and soul, you are marvelously made.

650
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,800
 I know you inside and out.

651
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,200
 I know every bone in your body.

652
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,560
 I know exactly how you were made bit by bit,

653
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,540
 how you were sculpted from nothing into something.

654
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:28,760
 Like an open book, I watched you grow

655
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,520
 from conception to birth.

656
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,840
 All the stages of your life were spread out before me.

657
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,800
 The days of your life, all prepared

658
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,800
 before you'd even lived one day.

659
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,760
 I want you to look at the screen now.

660
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,720
 We're gonna make a confession together.

661
00:41:50,720 --> 00:42:00,720
