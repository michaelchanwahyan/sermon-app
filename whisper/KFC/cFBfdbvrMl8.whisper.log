[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.360]   I get the privilege of closing this series as Peter closes his letter.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.220]   The Book of 1 Peter contains so much.
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.480]   In a way, we haven't been able to do it justice.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.800]   It might take a 10, 11, 12 week series and I look at every verse.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:46.600]   But in another way, in a world that is devoid of hope, we have, and I must thank our speakers
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   here.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   I must thank our speakers, James and Johnny, Michelle, and last week, Gabe.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.240]   And James, 33.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:08.160]   Our speakers have, I felt, clearly articulated the living hope that we hold as believers.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.560]   Now, those of you who know me well, you know I like pictures and I've got another one for
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   you.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560]   Okay.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.760]   As I prayed for this sermon, as I prayed about the series, I was given the picture of God
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.240]   parting the Red Sea through Moses.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.880]   Now let's look at this for a moment.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.880]   The world at the moment feels like there are waves that are upon us.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.080]   We've got COVID, we've got political uncertainty, we've got economic uncertainty.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   But God used Moses and he parted the Red Sea.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.040]   Now there are two things about this.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   Number one, when God parted the Red Sea, it did not disappear.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.480]   So actually, as we look at 1 Peter, as we look at what it is to have a living hope,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.680]   COVID is still going to be there.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.400]   Political uncertainty is still going to be there.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.720]   Economic uncertainty is still going to be there.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.880]   But what God is saying to us, and I believe he's using 1 Peter to do this, is I will use
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.880]   you.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:45.560]   I will use this teaching for you to find a way through these things.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.760]   The second thing which is very, very important, and I felt as I prayed about this, if you
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.160]   look in Moses' hand, he has a staff.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.200]   Now if you did a general knowledge quiz today and someone said, "Who parted the Red Sea?"
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.840]   I guess 90% of people would say Moses.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.400]   Moses did not part the Red Sea.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.000]   God parted the Red Sea, but God used Moses.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.760]   And God said to Moses two things, "What is in your hand?"
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.000]   "I just have a staff," he said.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.640]   He said, "Raise your staff."
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.920]   And I feel that God is saying, "Church, look at what's in your hand.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.680]   Don't look at what you don't have.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   Don't look at X, Y, Z church or ABC Christian and say, 'I haven't got what they've got.'
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.440]   What is in your hand?"
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.760]   And church, lift your staff.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.600]   If you're able to at home, yeah, lift your hand, lift your staff, because God said, "I
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.640]   made a way through the Red Sea, and I am the living hope who will make a way through these
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.320]   difficult times."
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:26.160]   Now Peter has in his letter spent much of it addressing different groups.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.560]   We've had husbands and wives, slaves and masters.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.640]   And he begins chapter five by addressing us older people.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.520]   He says, "Be shepherds."
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:54.740]   And for you younger people, that is everybody online apart from me and Joseph, he addresses
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.560]   the younger people to submit.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:15.680]   But my aim tonight is to highlight a path through the Red Sea for us, all of us, now
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.880]   in 2021.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:28.360]   And to do that, I want to pick up this letter at the point that Peter says, "Hey, all of
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.880]   you, let's read it."
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:46.600]   He said, "Yes, all of you be submissive to one another and be clothed with humility.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.040]   For God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:02.680]   Therefore, humble yourself under the mighty act of God, that he might exalt you in due
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:11.880]   time, casting all your care upon him, for he cares for you."
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.040]   Now sorry, I've lost my file.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:26.380]   As he closed this letter, Peter gave the church three important instructions to obey if they
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.900]   were to glorify God in this difficult experience.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:39.200]   They are the same three that he gives us in 2021.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.480]   Let's look at them.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.080]   They are number one, be humble.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.120]   Number two, be watchful.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.760]   And number three, be hopeful.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.120]   Let's look at them one at a time.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.960]   Firstly, be humble.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:10.660]   Peter said, "Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God."
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.000]   I want you to use the chat line now.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.100]   I want you to say in a word or words, what describes to you being humble?
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.280]   What does being humble mean to you?
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:39.360]   Let's have some suggestions.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.640]   Being grounded says Julian.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.720]   Think higher of others.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.420]   Serving others before self, Michelle.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.420]   Thank you.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.200]   Tony, don't take credit.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.840]   Paul and Jackie have a serving heart.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.800]   George, not thinking too highly of yourself.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:01.920]   Charlotte, the same thing, not thinking of yourself too much.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.960]   Listen before speaking, says Ken.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:13.160]   Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:20.300]   Thank you, Sterling, seeing everyone higher or better than me and myself at the lowest.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.840]   You don't need the rest of your sermon.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.680]   You've just done it in the chat box.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:33.420]   Now I always say in the Bible, when the word used is therefore, you have to ask yourself
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:39.120]   the question, what is it therefore?
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:54.160]   Now Peter had already warned the saints to be submissive and made the point, God can
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:05.340]   give that grace if and only if we humble ourselves before him.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:16.680]   Proverbs 6 and 8 tells us that God resists the proud because God hates the sin of pride.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.700]   It was pride that turned Lucifer into Satan.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:29.860]   It was pride, a desire to be like God that stirred Eve to take the forbidden fruit.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:37.580]   One John says the pride of life is an evidence of worldliness.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:45.860]   My friends, the antidote to pride is the grace of God.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:55.100]   And we receive that grace only when we yield ourselves to him.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:05.300]   And the evidence of that grace is when we yield to each other.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.300]   Submission is an act of faith.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.780]   Can I say it again?
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.200]   Submission is an act of faith.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:25.740]   We are trusting God to direct in our lives and to work out his purposes in his time.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.120]   After all, there is a danger in submitting to others.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:41.500]   They might take advantage of us, but not if we trust God and if we are truly submitted
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.480]   to one another.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:51.840]   Now the key of course to this is in the phrase, I've highlighted it, in due time, that he
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.760]   might exalt you in due time.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.700]   What does in due time mean?
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:11.900]   God never exalts anyone until that person is ready for it.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:23.000]   First the cross, then the glory, first the suffering, and then the crown.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:34.080]   Moses was under God's hands for 40 years before God sent him to deliver the Jews from Egypt.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:44.440]   Joseph was under God's hand for at least 13 years before God lifted him to the throne.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:52.120]   One of the evidences of our pride is our impatience with God.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:12:01.480]   And Peter repeatedly tells us that one reason for suffering is that we might learn patience
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.880]   to government authorities in 1 Peter 2.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.720]   That slaves submit to masters in 1 Peter 2.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.860]   And that wives submit to husbands.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:18.300]   Now I've upset all the women, I'm sorry, but that's what the Bible says.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:33.620]   Now he commanded all of the believers to submit to God and to submit to each other.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:42.220]   I want to hear, reiterate KFCI's commitment to all age ministry.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:50.060]   I have to say my heart was so full last week when Gabe preached to us.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:56.540]   Because so often there is a generation war in church.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.580]   With the older people resisting change.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:06.060]   And the younger people resisting the older people.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:14.060]   Which is why our A in Cameo is for all age.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.580]   The solution is I believe twofold.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.300]   I put it on the screen.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:27.580]   All believers, young and old, should submit to one another.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:33.380]   And secondly, all should submit to God.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:42.420]   The expression be clothed with humility is Peter's answer to the problem.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:50.600]   Just as Jesus laid aside his outer garments and put on a towel to become a servant.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:57.740]   So each of us should have a servant attitude and minister to each other.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:04.540]   C.S. Lewis says this, I think it was similar to what you said, George.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:11.140]   Humility is not demeaning ourselves and thinking poorly of ourselves.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:17.820]   It is simply not thinking of ourselves at all.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:27.940]   Indeed, we can never be submissive to each other until we are first submissive to God.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.060]   And Peter quoted Proverbs 3.34 to defend his point.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.900]   A verse that is also quoted in James 4.6.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.340]   God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.140]   I'm sorry I'm getting excited.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:51.540]   It takes grace to submit to another believer.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:15:00.260]   But here, Peter was referring to the words he heard Jesus say to him.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:08.720]   For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.900]   Those who humble themselves will be exalted.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:22.900]   One of the benefits of this kind of relationship with God is the privilege of letting him take
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.020]   care of our burdens.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:34.820]   Unless we meet the conditions laid down in 1 Peter 5, we cannot claim the wonderful promise
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:43.980]   in 1 Peter 5, 7, casting all your care upon him for he cares for you.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:53.820]   The word translated care means anxiety, the state of being pulled apart.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.740]   I guess we all know how that feels at the moment when circumstances are difficult like
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.700]   now.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.340]   It is easy for us to be anxious and worried.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:17.820]   But if we are, we will miss God's blessing and become poor witnesses to the lost.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.260]   I just want to pause there because I just sense in my heart that there are people listening
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.700]   tonight who really will identify with this.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.620]   You feel anxious.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.980]   You feel worried.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:37.500]   But if we do, we may miss God's blessings.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:45.460]   We need his inward peace if we are going to triumph in the fiery trial, triumph in the
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.700]   Red Sea and bring glory to his name.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:17:00.540]   In 1 Peter 5, 7, we must once and for all give all of our cares, past, present, and
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.580]   future to the Lord.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:14.960]   We mustn't hand them to him piecemeal, keeping those cares that we think we can handle ourselves.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:24.180]   If we keep the little cares for ourselves, they will soon become big problems.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:33.500]   Each time a new burden arises, we must by faith, we must by faith remind the Lord and
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:39.140]   ourselves that we have already turned it over to him.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:46.960]   Now if anybody knew that from experience that God cares for his own, it was Peter.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.660]   When you read the four gospels, you would discover that Peter shared in some wonderful
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.360]   miracles.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.520]   Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.380]   It gave him a great catch of fish.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.460]   He helped him pay his temple tax.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.760]   He helped him walk on the water.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   He repaired the damage that he did to the ear of Malchus.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:18.480]   And he even delivered Peter from prison in Acts chapter 12.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:27.760]   And it begs the question, how does God show his love and care for us when we give our
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   cares to him?
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:37.680]   And I want to answer that by saying he performs four wonderful ministries on our behalf.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.720]   Number one, he gives us courage to face our cares honestly.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.960]   Number two, he gives us wisdom to understand the situation.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.640]   Number three, he gives us strength to do what we must do.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.360]   And number four, he gives us faith to trust him to do the rest.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:06.880]   I want you to look at that slide for a moment.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:16.560]   Some people give God their burdens and expect him to do everything.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:26.240]   But my friends, it's important that we let him work in us as well as work for us.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.400]   Can I just say that again?
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:37.840]   It's important that we let God work in us as well as work for us so that we will be
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.040]   prepared when the answer comes.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.880]   Trust your burdens on the Lord and he will sustain you.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.640]   Let's read on and find the second instruction.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.600]   Be sober.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.680]   I think that was for you, Michelle, after you had the communion wine.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   Okay.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.960]   Be sober.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.320]   Be vigilant.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:11.000]   Because your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.480]   Resist him.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:22.760]   Steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   in the world.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.480]   So here we have the second instruction.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.120]   It is be watchful.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.640]   He says in verse eight, be vigilant.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.280]   Other versions say be alert.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:46.440]   Now one reason that we have cares is because we have an enemy.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.040]   As the serpent, Satan deceives.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.280]   And as the lion, Satan devours.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.360]   The word Satan means adversary.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:04.720]   And the word devil means the accuser, the slanderer.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:11.760]   Gabe told us last week that the recipient of this letter had already experienced the
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:23.680]   attacks of the slanderer and now would meet the lion in their fiery trial.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:36.320]   And Peter gave them several practical instructions to help them get victory over their adversary.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:44.160]   Now those of you who know me well will know I love words that start with R. So the first
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.960]   thing we're to do is this.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.240]   We're to respect him.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.400]   He is dangerous.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:22:00.280]   Now this might surprise you to hear me say this.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:06.440]   But no doubt Satan is a dangerous enemy.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.760]   He is a serpent who can bite us when we least expect it.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.960]   He is a destroyer and an accuser.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:23.680]   He has great power, great intelligence, and a host of demons who assist him in his attacks
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.520]   against God's people.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.680]   He is a formidable enemy.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:39.000]   We should never joke about him, ignore him, or underestimate his ability.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.960]   Peter says we must be sober and have our minds under control when it comes to conflict with
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.800]   Satan.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:58.960]   Now a part of this soberness includes not blaming everything on the devil.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:07.480]   Some people see a demon behind every bush and blame Satan for their headaches, their
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:14.360]   flat tires, or even their high rent in mid-levels.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:21.520]   I heard a story of a lady who phoned her past a long distance to inform him that Satan had
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.440]   caused her to shrink three and a half inches.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:36.400]   While I do have great respect for the wiles and the powers of the devil, I still feel
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:48.120]   we must get our information about him from the Bible and not from our own interpretation
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.480]   of experiences.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.520]   My second R is recognize him.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.360]   Scripture tells us he is a great pretender.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.240]   I guess that's a cue for a song.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:09.040]   Because he is a subtle foe, we must be vigilant and always on guard.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.560]   His strategy is to counterfeit whatever God does.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:23.760]   According to the parable of the tares in Matthew 13, whenever God plants a true Christian,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.960]   Satan seeks to plant a counterfeit.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:38.280]   One John 2 says he would deceive us were it not for the word of God and the spirit of
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   God.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:47.360]   The better we know God's word, the keener our spiritual senses will be to detect Satan
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.440]   at work.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:58.960]   One John 4 says we must test the spirits and to know the false from the true and the true
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.280]   from the false.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:10.720]   My last R and possibly the most important is that we resist him.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:22.040]   This means that we take our stand on the word of God and refuse to be moved.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:31.760]   Ephesians 6, the chapter about the armor of God, instructs us to firstly stand, then to
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.560]   withstand, and then thirdly to stand again.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.920]   Unless we stand, we cannot withstand.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:47.520]   Our weapons are the word of God and prayer, and our protection is the complete armor that
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.520]   God has given us.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:58.040]   We resist him in the faith.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.760]   That is our faith in God.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:06.760]   Just as David took his stand against Goliath and trusted in the name of Jehovah, so we
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:14.000]   take our stand against Satan in the victorious name of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.080]   Now a word of caution here.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:25.440]   Never discuss things with Satan or his associates.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:33.640]   We've made that mistake and we all know the sad consequences.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:41.560]   Also never try to fight with Satan in your own way.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:47.240]   Resist him the way Jesus did with the word of God.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:53.880]   And Peter tells us never get the idea that you're the only one going through these battles
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.160]   because we are all facing the same trials.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:08.200]   Church, we must pray for one another and encourage one another in the Lord.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:14.400]   And just remember our personal victories will help others, just as their victories will
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.680]   help us.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:22.920]   Had Peter obeyed these instructions the night Jesus was arrested, he would not have gone
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.960]   to sleep in the garden.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:34.160]   He would not attack Malchus the servant and he would not have denied Jesus.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.480]   He did not take the Lord's warning seriously.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.080]   In fact, he argued with him.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:53.640]   Not only did he recognize Satan when the adversary inflated his ego with pride, told him he didn't
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:28:00.240]   have to watch and pray, and then incited him to use his sword.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:07.480]   Had Peter listened to the Lord and resisted the enemy, he would have escaped all of these
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.840]   failures.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:19.040]   Both Peter and James give us the same formula for success.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:27.160]   Therefore, submit to God.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:35.760]   Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:47.400]   But before we can stand before Satan, we must bow before God.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:55.560]   Peter resisted the Lord and ended up submitting to Satan.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.560]   Let's read on and find the last instruction.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:08.200]   "But may the God of all grace who called us to his eternal glory by Jesus Christ, after
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:16.560]   you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.760]   To him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.800]   Amen."
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.760]   Now last instruction, isn't it wonderful that we get to it?
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.280]   Be hopeful.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.120]   Repeat it to yourself.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:42.960]   The book of 1 Peter started with hope and finishes with hope.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:50.080]   Peter closed on a positive note and reminded his readers that God knew what he was doing
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.400]   and was in complete control.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:01.200]   No matter how difficult the fiery trial may become, and I know that some of you have been
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:09.320]   going through fiery trials, no matter how difficult, a Christian always has hope.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.440]   Peter gave several reasons for this hopeful attitude.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.760]   Number one, we have God's grace.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.280]   Look again at what our speakers have told us each week.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.720]   James said our salvation is because of his grace.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.920]   He said he called us before we called on him.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:38.440]   Johnny said we have tasted that the Lord is gracious, so we are not afraid of anything
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.480]   that he purposes for us.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:51.660]   Michelle and Gabe said his grace is manifold and meets every situation in life.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:58.600]   As we submit to him, he gives us all the grace that we need.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.920]   In fact, verse 10, he is described as the God of all grace.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:13.320]   He has the grace in every time of need and we must stand in that grace.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.640]   This is the end of our series.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:25.220]   And the end of our series moves from grace to glory.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:29.820]   We know we are going to glory.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:39.820]   He has in verse 10 said he has called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:50.100]   James in week one told us this is the wonderful inheritance into which we were born.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:59.180]   My friends, whatever begins with God's grace will always lead to God's glory.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.180]   Okay, let's say that again.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:12.600]   Whatever begins with God's grace will always lead us to God's glory.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:22.380]   If we depend on God's grace when we suffer, that suffering will result in glory.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.260]   Remember this.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.380]   The road may be difficult.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:33.180]   It might look like the Red Sea, but it leads to glory.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.700]   And that is all that really counts.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:43.340]   Our present suffering is only for a while.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.320]   Our various trials are only for a season.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.820]   But the glory that results is eternal.
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:33:00.460]   Secondly, we know that our trials are building Christian character.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:09.500]   The Greek word translated makes you perfect means to equip, to adjust, to fit together.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:16.020]   It is translated in Matthew 4.21 as mending nets.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:23.500]   God has several tools that he uses to equip his people for life and service.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.540]   And suffering is one of them.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.900]   The word of God is another one too.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:36.420]   He also uses the fellowship and the ministry of the church.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:49.140]   Our Savior in heaven is perfecting his children so that they will do his will and his work.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:55.140]   As I conclude the favorite word of my sermons, right?
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:06.020]   Peter uses three words to describe the kind of character that God wants us to have.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:11.060]   Selfish means to fix firmly, to set fast.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:16.020]   Christians must not be shaky or wobbly in their stand for Christ.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:21.340]   Our hearts need to be established and this is accomplished by God's truth.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:27.020]   The believer who is established will not be moved by persecution or led away by false
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.020]   doctrine.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:33.180]   Secondly, strengthened means just that.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.580]   God's strength given to us to meet the demands of life.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:47.420]   What good is it to stand on a firm foundation if we don't have the power to act and settle
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:57.380]   is the translation of a word which means to lay a foundation.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:03.380]   The house that was founded upon the rock withstood the storm.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:11.300]   A believer who is equipped by God will continue in the faith grounded and settled.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.260]   Colossians 1 tells us that.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:19.940]   He will not be tossed to and fro and carried by every wind of doctrine.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:26.300]   When an unbeliever goes through suffering, he loses his hope.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:34.020]   But for a believer, suffering only increases his hope.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.900]   Romans 5, I love this.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:48.620]   Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering brings perseverance.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:55.140]   Perseverance, character and character, hope.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.380]   Let me read that again.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:05.460]   And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings perseverance
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:15.180]   and perseverance, character and character, hope.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:24.820]   God builds character and brightens hope when a believer trusts in him and depends on his
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.940]   grace.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:35.460]   The result is that God receives the glory forever and ever.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:44.500]   So a reminder, be humble, be watchful, be hopeful.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.620]   Now Paul always ended his letters with a benediction of grace.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:54.980]   Peter closed this epistle with a benediction of peace.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.780]   He said, "Greet one another with a kiss of love."
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.140]   I wish I was there to be able to do that for you.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.220]   Greet one another with a kiss of love.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.820]   Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.740]   Amen.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:16.900]   Peter opened his letter with a greeting of peace in 1 Peter 1 verse 2.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:23.700]   And so the entire epistle points to God's peace from beginning to end.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:32.380]   What a wonderful way to end a letter that announced the coming of a fiery trial.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:40.300]   The church today is facing a fiery trial and we must be prepared.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:45.380]   Remember the Red Sea.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:59.460]   But whatever may come, Peter is still saying to each one of us, be hopeful, the glory is
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.500]   soon to come.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:11.660]   We're going to finish the series as we started the series by singing that song, "Living Hope."
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:19.340]   I want you to look at every word as you sing this, as we conclude our series.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.540]   And then Michelle will pray for us.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.300]   Amen.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
