1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 Can you hear me now?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,440
 Thank you Gabriel for doing that and then running back to do the sound.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,420
 Hey, good to see you all.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,740
 What a crazy week we've had.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,220
 What a crazy week we've had.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,900
 Last week we were at Typhoon Aid and then we went on Zoom and then we had another typhoon

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,900
 five days later.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,900
 That's unprecedented, right?

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,300
 And then public holiday.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,000
 Thank you Paul for leading worship.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,680
 And Paul, I've got to embarrass you here.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,240
 Paul asked a question.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,000
 Paul asked a very important question this week.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,680
 A question which some of us were worried that would not get the right answer.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:50,000
 But he got the right answer and Melanie here said yes.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Of course it really probably wasn't a surprise.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,880
 It's the first time she's seen Paul take a haircut and iron a shirt for a long, long

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
 time.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,840
 I'm going to be praying for you Melanie all the days of your life.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,080
 Oh dear.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,600
 So happy, so happy, so shocked but so happy.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,120
 Oh dear.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
 Hey it's really good.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,680
 It really is good to be here today.

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,440
 And we've been going through the book of Timothy.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,560
 Paul charges Timothy with all these things.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,400
 Chapter one he charges him to uphold truth.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,080
 And then chapter two he charges him to pray.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,440
 Chapter three he talks about what a leader is.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,920
 He charges him to lead.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,760
 Chapter four he talks about how to be a good servant.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,920
 And of course if you rewind your mind all the way back to the beginning, chapter one

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
 verse five, the aim of the charge, the goal of the command is what?

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
 Is love.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,720
 Love that issues from a pure heart, just a state of single-minded devotion.

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,480
 From a good conscience where it's discerning what is right and wrong.

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,040
 Not just for themselves as individuals but in the context of community.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,720
 What's right and wrong for everyone.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,000
 And finally a sincere faith, a certain level of genuineness that came with it.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,400
 And really that's why we love.

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,720
 That's where love comes from.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,240
 But you know what, as I'm reading this book and I love this book and I feel as though

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,400
 I relate a lot to this young pastor Timothy, I don't know, as I'm reading these chapters

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
 I'm like these are high callings.

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,440
 These charges are intense.

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
 They're real.

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,360
 And if I'm Timothy I feel as though I might be crumbling under the pressure.

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,900
 I might be going, "Man, this is so much stuff to do.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,400
 This is so hard.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
 How do I love?"

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,840
 And maybe, again, this is only my interpretation, "Paul, you don't know the specific group of

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
 people that I'm calling to.

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,680
 You don't know about that group of guys, that group of men who are really causing me trouble.

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,340
 How do I love them?"

55
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,360
 Or maybe there's this other group that are manipulating the church community to get what

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 they want.

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
 How do I love them?

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
 This is hard.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
 This is not easy.

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
 And we know that Timothy is under stress here.

61
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,920
 Chapter 5 verse 23, Paul almost alludes to that.

62
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,600
 He's saying, "Hey, you've got a lot of ailments.

63
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
 You've got a lot of problems.

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
 This is probably the stress."

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,280
 He even gives him some practical health advice about having a little wine just to kind of

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
 help him.

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,360
 And so we know that Timothy is under a lot of stress.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,660
 And he knows that the goal is love.

69
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,160
 He knows where love comes from.

70
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,400
 But the real question is, what does love look like on the other side?

71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
 How does he express it out to the other side?

72
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
 And as I look at chapter 5 here, the title is "Instructions for the Church."

73
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,080
 There's really three themes that pop up that are on the screen, which is, one is, he must

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,040
 love everyone like family.

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,400
 And the second one is, he must love everyone in need.

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,280
 He has to love those who are in need.

77
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,840
 And finally, to love everyone who leads, to love those who are in leadership.

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,440
 And we're not going to be able to go through every verse today.

79
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,480
 We don't have time for that.

80
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,600
 But I wanted to look at these three themes and ask ourselves, how do we apply that to

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 us right now?

82
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,360
 And actually, I love it when Johnny leads, just because of the energy that he has.

83
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,400
 For all of you who are new here, it might have been terrifying to shout your name out.

84
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,080
 But for us, actually, it's really nice to hear who you are and to welcome you into this

85
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
 family.

86
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,440
 And for me, that's such value.

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
 And so we're going to look at these ones.

88
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,320
 And I want to start jumping straight away and look at the first one.

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 Love everyone like family.

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,800
 Verse 1 and 2, what does it say?

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,280
 Do not rebuke an older man, but encourage him as you would a father, younger men as

92
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,480
 brothers, older women as mothers, younger women as sisters in all purity.

93
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,240
 He's saying you've got to love these people like family.

94
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:49,960
 The great theologian that is Dominic Toretto, or Vin Diesel, from the films Fast and Furious.

95
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,000
 He talks about this a lot.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,240
 In fact, everything that Dominic Toretto does is about family.

97
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
 It's all about...

98
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
 And what's his famous line?

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,600
 "I don't have friends.

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,720
 I have family."

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,400
 And that's hit the aim of his charge.

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,320
 Everything that he does is about family.

103
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,160
 And really, Paul's saying the same thing to Timothy here.

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,200
 He's saying if you want your church to survive, if you want your church to thrive, you need

105
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,680
 to treat each other like family.

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,720
 I wonder when you walked in here today, when you walked into this building, when you walked

107
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,440
 into this room, of course, the first thought is, "Wow, it's so cold in here."

108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,360
 But the second thought must be, "Did you think, 'Are these people family, or are they just

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,360
 friends, or are they acquaintances, or are they just fellow attendees?'"

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,080
 Because you see, the thing is, if we're going to make church work, we have to treat each

111
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,680
 other as family.

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,040
 You know what Paul's doing here?

113
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,120
 He's laying down a blueprint for cross-generational ministry.

114
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,840
 He's laying down a blueprint on how you make church work.

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,800
 And actually, this applies directly to us here at KFC, because Senior Pastor Peter,

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,920
 his vision is what?

117
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
 Cross-generational ministry.

118
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,640
 Kwa doi thong han.

119
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,240
 How do we do it so that the old can be with the younger?

120
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,600
 But you see, here's the thing, and maybe Hong Kong has this more than anywhere else in the

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
 world.

122
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,280
 There are so many gaps, so, so many gaps.

123
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,720
 Right now, the biggest gap, of course, there are plenty.

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
 One is the age gap.

125
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,200
 There's the generation gap that's never been this wide because of globalization, because

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 of technology.

127
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,920
 Old people don't understand young people.

128
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
 Young people don't want to understand old people.

129
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
 And so you have this big divide here.

130
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
 But then you have other ones.

131
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,040
 You have the political one, and then you have the socioeconomic one.

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
 You have the gender one.

133
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,280
 So, there are all these gaps.

134
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,320
 Can you imagine Timothy trying to keep this group together, whilst there's still persecution

135
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,840
 outside, but trying to keep them together and stop them from fighting?

136
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,960
 And so, Paul gives him some very specific advice and says, "Hey, treat them like family.

137
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
 Love everyone like family."

138
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,880
 And he goes to the first one, he says, "Don't rebuke the older men.

139
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,720
 Encourage them as you would a father."

140
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
 What's he saying here?

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,320
 He knows that maybe there's a group of older men, grumpy old men.

142
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,280
 Does anyone know any grumpy old men?

143
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,120
 Is anyone a grumpy old man?

144
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,080
 Just picture this, maybe the Pixar film Up, Mr. Fredrickson, this kind of grumpy old man.

145
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,480
 He ends up getting disarmed by this cute Russell.

146
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
 Why?

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,040
 Because he's filled with love and innocence and encourages him.

148
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,840
 And he's saying, "Don't rebuke the older men, but encourage them like you would your father."

149
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,760
 He's saying, "Treat them with respect.

150
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,240
 Treat them with appreciation."

151
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,400
 That actually older people have wisdom that you don't have.

152
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,040
 That older people have gone to places, have walked further than you ever have.

153
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,140
 So, respect them.

154
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,080
 You stand on the shoulders of the giants who come before you.

155
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,800
 So, treat them with humility.

156
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,520
 Treat them with respect.

157
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,640
 Treat them as you would your father.

158
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,160
 Of course, these are ideal family values and ideal family roles here.

159
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,960
 And then he talks about younger men.

160
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,920
 He's saying, "Treat your younger men, the younger men as what?

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 As brothers."

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 What does he mean here?

163
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,000
 He says, "Treat them as equals."

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,040
 So, with older men, you have to show appreciation.

165
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,640
 With the younger ones, you have to treat them as your companions.

166
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,800
 He's saying, "Don't look down on them."

167
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,000
 Actually, the chapter just before in chapter four, he says, "Timothy, you're young.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
 Don't let anyone look down on you."

169
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,520
 Yet set an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.

170
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,640
 But then he's saying, "Don't let anyone look down on you, but don't you go and look down

171
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,160
 on the younger ones."

172
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
 We've all been there, right?

173
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,680
 When we look at someone young and look at someone who looks seemingly naive, who probably

174
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,880
 is naive, who's just about to make the same mistakes that we did, and we're like, "Oh,

175
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
 young person.

176
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,380
 Oh, young blood.

177
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,040
 You just don't know."

178
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,520
 And he's saying, "With those people, treat them as brothers.

179
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,720
 Treat them as equals.

180
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
 Be patient with them."

181
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,040
 Then he talks about older women.

182
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,480
 He says, "Hey, treat your older women as your mothers."

183
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 What does that mean?

184
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
 Treat them with affection.

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
 Treat them with love.

186
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
 Treat them with respect.

187
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,640
 Treat them with obedience.

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,320
 And finally, with younger sisters, he says, "Treat them in purity as though they are your

189
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,520
 own sister."

190
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,400
 Young Timothy here must have, again, Paul talks about it.

191
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
 "Hey, flee the desires of your youth."

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,480
 So, he would have had these temptations.

193
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,760
 He says, "Treat the younger women like your sister."

194
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,120
 So, no domineering, no manipulating, no lusting.

195
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,080
 Treat them as though they are your younger sister.

196
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,560
 Love everyone like family.

197
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,580
 And that is the key here for us.

198
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,080
 This is the key theme that I want you to keep in your mind as we look around.

199
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
 Look around the people next to you.

200
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,720
 Do you treat them as family?

201
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
 Not just friends, as family?

202
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
 And of course, it's very hard.

203
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,600
 You see, we struggle with our own family sometimes, right?

204
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
 But we bear with them.

205
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 Why?

206
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,000
 Because we didn't get to choose them and we can't run away from them.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 But here's the thing.

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,360
 Sometimes we treat church as though we can pick and choose.

209
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,800
 But I think the heart of Jesus, the heart of Paul is, "No, actually, just like your

210
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,960
 blood family, you don't really get to choose your spiritual family either."

211
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,360
 You're here, we're in a city that's just filled with us just choosing and picking in different

212
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,560
 churches just to go and attend, just to go and consume.

213
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,960
 But actually, if you treated that church community like family, then you would commit to saying,

214
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
 "Hello.

215
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,480
 Ah, you're late, young man.

216
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,840
 Sorry, everyone.

217
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,240
 I don't call everyone out like that.

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,720
 That's actually my younger brother.

219
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:39,760
 So you have to call him higher and just point him out.

220
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,560
 Treat everyone like family."

221
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,200
 Oh dear.

222
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 So that's the first one.

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,080
 And that's the one that will drive us with the other two points, which is this, which

224
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,880
 is love everyone in need.

225
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,880
 Verse three says this, "Honor widows who are truly widows."

226
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,640
 Just to give you a little bit of understanding about why widows.

227
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,920
 Back in the ancient world, widows or women would be solely, fully reliant on the men.

228
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,660
 Their livelihood will be based on the man.

229
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:21,320
 So just imagine if that woman lost her husband, then she would actually be completely excluded

230
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,640
 from so many things.

231
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,200
 Back then, there would be no life insurance.

232
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
 There'd be no pension.

233
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,600
 There'd be no government assistance.

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,120
 So what really Paul is saying here is honor and look after those and love those who are

235
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,320
 in need.

236
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
 And widows symbolize that need.

237
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,360
 In fact, we know how big a problem this is because that's how deacons came to be.

238
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,800
 Acts chapter six, you have the apostles who were busy ministering.

239
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,120
 And then suddenly what you had was a group of widows over here who were fighting for

240
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,240
 food and arguing.

241
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,400
 And so they said, "Okay, we're going to have to sort this out.

242
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
 This is a problem."

243
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,440
 So you can imagine the desperation that the widows would have.

244
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,800
 Because now they have no one to defend them, no one to look after them.

245
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
 And you know what?

246
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
 God has always had a thing for widows.

247
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,000
 Since Israel's inception, he has made himself a defender of widows, defender of those in

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 need.

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,280
 He's written them into the laws that those in need will truly be looked after.

250
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,400
 In fact, justice within the community would be measured in part by its treatment of the

251
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,720
 widows.

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,160
 So you see here, God takes people in need.

253
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,080
 God takes widows very, very seriously.

254
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,720
 The apostle James, he talks about this.

255
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,040
 What's true religion?

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,140
 True religion is one that would care for orphans and widows.

257
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,000
 So we know how important, we know how serious this is.

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,740
 And so verse five, verse five, it says, "She who is truly a widow left all alone."

259
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,560
 But it says something very interesting in this is, "Honor widows, those who are truly

260
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
 widows."

261
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,740
 What does that mean?

262
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,320
 Why did he have to say it twice?

263
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,160
 You see, most likely what was happening at that point was there were people within the

264
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,160
 community who were widows, but some of them were trading on their widowhood.

265
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,640
 They were taking advantage of the situation that the church needs to look after each other.

266
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,000
 They'd seen in Acts chapter two, or at least the events of Acts chapter two, that they

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 would care for each other.

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 They would share everything.

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,460
 So some of the widows who actually did have family themselves, they weren't on their own,

270
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,360
 but they were trading on their widowhood to basically benefit.

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,760
 So Paul's saying, "Those who are truly in need."

272
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,080
 He's talking about a widow who has no one else, who has no children to look after at

273
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 all.

274
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,520
 He's just saying, "For those people who are in need, the church has a responsibility

275
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,760
 to love them and to look after them."

276
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,400
 Because the church simply didn't have the resources to look after everyone.

277
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,120
 And what we see here again is Paul, he's tying the household with the church, and he's saying

278
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,800
 they're basically one and the same.

279
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:52,120
 He's saying family responsibilities are the primary expression of Christian discipleship.

280
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,960
 That's the primary platform where you can exercise this, to look after those within

281
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,360
 your family is basically a form of Christian discipleship.

282
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
 It's basically a form of being a Christian.

283
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,520
 And he says this, he says, "If you don't even do this, you're worse than an unbeliever."

284
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,200
 Because even those who don't know Jesus, they still look after their family.

285
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,760
 So you must too.

286
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,760
 So we need to look after those who are in need.

287
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,120
 We need to look after the widows.

288
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,440
 And then he starts coming out with some pretty specific instructions.

289
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,400
 He's saying, "Actually, if these widows are 60 and over, the older widows, enroll them

290
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,800
 into the church and have them serve the church community."

291
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 Why?

292
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,000
 Because those who are older would have all this wisdom and all this experience to share

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,880
 with the younger people.

294
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,760
 But also because maybe anyone over 60, they're probably less likely to want to get remarried

295
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
 again.

296
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,000
 And then he gets very specific and he says, "Those who are under 60, who are younger,

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,800
 don't let them enroll, because likely they are going to want to get married."

298
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,160
 And he didn't want them to be torn by these two desires, by wanting to serve the church,

299
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,400
 but then also wanting still to have a family to care for.

300
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,480
 So for those older ones that are there to enroll, he says this.

301
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,240
 He says that you can't just enroll them just because they're over 60.

302
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,280
 They need to have shown their worth.

303
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,480
 They need to have shown their character.

304
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,280
 There's a couple of traits in verse 10 that he talks about.

305
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,720
 He says, "They have to have been known to bring up children.

306
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,440
 They need to know how to care for young people.

307
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,120
 They need to have shown hospitality.

308
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,320
 They need to have washed the feet of the saints."

309
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,800
 Now, of course, that term, "wash the feet of the saints," it was an idiom.

310
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,200
 It wasn't, "Hey, if you want to go enroll in the church, you've got to go find yourself

311
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,680
 a saint and then wash their feet, and then you will be allowed in the church."

312
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
 That's not what it was.

313
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,720
 It was saying, it's an idiom in paying tribute to what Jesus did himself when he washed the

314
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 feet of his disciples.

315
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,120
 He's saying this person, these older widows, have to be filled with love and care for the

316
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,240
 next generation.

317
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
 Then enroll them in.

318
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
 But for the younger ones, don't do that.

319
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,860
 Again, seems a little bit harsh, but likely what was happening at that point were people

320
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,520
 who, younger ones maybe specifically, who were trading on their widowhood, benefiting

321
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,960
 from the church, but then spending their time being idle, going from house to house, being

322
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
 busybodies.

323
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,320
 That's where the middle of that chapter really talks about, and it really addresses saying,

324
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
 "Don't do that."

325
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,960
 Paul's saying, "But don't allow people to be lazy.

326
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,080
 Love those in need, but love wisely."

327
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,620
 We have to show discernment when we love people.

328
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,760
 Love them wisely.

329
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,400
 Paul talks about this in 2 Thessalonians 3.

330
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,200
 He says, he's very simple, he's very blunt.

331
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,840
 He says, "Those who don't work, don't eat."

332
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,400
 Those who don't work, don't eat.

333
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,400
 Of course, millennials, that will be heartbroken to hear that.

334
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,600
 Those who don't work, don't eat.

335
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,960
 What you see here then is Paul's treatment of this, and he's being very specific, strangely

336
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
 specific.

337
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,200
 His treatment of this suggests one thing to me.

338
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,480
 When you're loving those in need, you need to love them wisely, and it's not just about

339
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
 money.

340
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,660
 In fact, there's a primary goal when you help someone, and that is to disciple them, to facilitate

341
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:05,760
 and to nurture godliness, to bring them closer to God, and to help them to be productive,

342
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,720
 to help them bear fruit.

343
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,160
 Paul here lays down, as specific as it is, a carefully manufactured, sorry, a carefully

344
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,500
 structured ministry to facilitate discipleship and godliness.

345
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,780
 That's what he's trying to do.

346
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,560
 It's not just about throwing money at a problem and letting that be that.

347
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,760
 I just highlighted my brother just then, and actually in a couple of weeks, he's going

348
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
 to actually come up to the stage to share with me, and I'll give you a little bit of

349
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
 a preview now.

350
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,600
 He's running for an NGO called Hope International, and there's this mindset where, again, he

351
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,640
 does a whole ton of stuff that I don't really understand, but the key thing here really

352
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,160
 is instead of his charity, which helps a lot of people in developing countries, especially

353
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,600
 in Africa, the goal is not to just give them fish, but to train them how to fish, to equip

354
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,880
 them, to facilitate them, to build them up, and you'll hear more about that at the end

355
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
 of the month.

356
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,500
 And so there's this same thing that Paul is trying to nurture here in this very carefully

357
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,000
 structured ministry, is love those in need, love them wisely, with the goal of nurturing

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,060
 godliness out.

359
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,120
 So the question really for us is, what are we doing?

360
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,760
 What we see here is that the church must have compassion for those in need.

361
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,160
 It must seek to include those who have been excluded.

362
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,340
 When was the last time we helped someone who was in need?

363
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,600
 Because that's what family does, right?

364
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,840
 They made 10 films out of this idea that family needs to look after each other because there's

365
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,920
 someone in need.

366
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,960
 Whether it's to hijack and steal lots of cars and drive tanks over cliffs, the whole premise

367
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,640
 of these 10 films is, "Hey, I don't have friends.

368
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,680
 I have family, and I have a family member in need, so I'm going to go and catch some

369
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,560
 big villain somewhere."

370
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
 And that's it.

371
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,960
 But that's the truth, that when you have family, when you have those in need, you need to care

372
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 for them.

373
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,120
 So we as a church, if we are a family, that we're not just a country club, we're not just

374
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,720
 a corporation, but we're a family, then are we genuinely helping those in need?

375
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,460
 Are we helping the disenfranchised youth of the city?

376
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,680
 Are we helping the teen moms, the single moms?

377
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,840
 Are we helping those who are divorced?

378
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,160
 Are we helping those who are ex-convicts?

379
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,480
 Are we helping those who have disabilities?

380
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
 Are we doing these things?

381
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,800
 And again, it's not just about throwing money at the problem and saying, "I've helped them."

382
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,680
 There's more to it, because the goal isn't just to help fulfill their temporary earthly

383
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,120
 need, that of course is a huge part of it, but then the second part is how do we draw

384
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,320
 them closer to God?

385
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
 What can we do?

386
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,120
 How do we love those in need in a way that is wise?

387
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,000
 And that really is the second point here.

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,880
 And the third and the final one, he goes into this final part of the passage from verse

389
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,080
 17, and he says this, "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor,

390
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,560
 especially those who labor in preaching and in teaching."

391
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,760
 So he's just talked about those in need, and now he talks about those who lead.

392
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,440
 And he talked about this in chapter three, but he kind of goes back to it again, and

393
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,200
 he's saying, "Elders, pastors, shepherds, overseers," whatever translation you want

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,520
 to use, "They are worthy of double honor if they are doing it well."

395
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,320
 What does that mean?

396
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
 Why double honor?

397
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,520
 Really, the double honor here is talking about two things.

398
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,000
 It's talking about respect and remuneration.

399
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,880
 It's talking about appreciation and compensation.

400
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,760
 He's saying, "If you have elders within your flock who have given their time fully to serving

401
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,200
 this church, then you need to look after them.

402
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,120
 You need to respect them, and you need to appreciate them."

403
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,920
 And then he jumps into this Old Testament passage, I think verse 18, where actually

404
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,600
 this is handed down again from the days of Moses.

405
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,280
 And he's saying, "Hey," verse 18, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain."

406
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:56,200
 He's saying, "If God ordains ample provision for an ox who's treading grain, then how much

407
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,060
 more should a community look after the elders who are caring for them?"

408
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,040
 And so he's saying, "Respect them and support them, especially those who are preaching and

409
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,320
 teaching and doing it well.

410
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,280
 It's important to care for those who have been placed in roles of leadership, and you

411
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,260
 need to love them in the right way."

412
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,760
 And just before you're an elder or a preacher or a pastor who's getting very excited about

413
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,580
 this, he then talks about something else as well.

414
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,440
 Because loving them has to be wise.

415
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,600
 You don't just pay them, you don't just respect them, but you also hold them accountable.

416
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,520
 And then he talks about two separate things here.

417
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,360
 He talks about indictment and appointment.

418
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,960
 And he talks about this interesting part here in verse 19.

419
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,320
 So he goes from telling them, "Hey, respect your pastors, support financially your pastors,

420
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,720
 but also hold them accountable."

421
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,080
 Because verse 19, he says, "Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence

422
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
 or two or three witnesses."

423
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,520
 Again, he's not making up new rules here.

424
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,120
 These are handed out from the Old Testament days, where he's saying, "If there is a complaint

425
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,720
 against an elder, there have to be at least two or three witnesses who bring this charge

426
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,120
 together."

427
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
 What is that?

428
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,360
 That's essentially just an effective deterrent against gossiping, against the gossipers,

429
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 or against...

430
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,100
 It stops personal vendettas.

431
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,160
 So if there genuinely is a problem with a pastor, if there genuinely is a problem with

432
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,960
 me, then you go to them with two or three people for accountability purposes, and then

433
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,760
 you hold that elder accountable.

434
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,860
 Now in the event where the elder actually is in the wrong, they should repent.

435
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,040
 But he's saying if they don't, then you've got to rebuke them in public.

436
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,940
 Now why public?

437
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,600
 Because the role of a leader is a public office.

438
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,600
 So if someone is in a leadership role, then they need to be rebuked publicly as well.

439
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
 Why?

440
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
 Because, again, so you can warn others.

441
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,160
 So you can set the standard for the whole community.

442
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
 Why?

443
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,640
 Because once again, the church needed to be in a state of purity, not to have any corruption.

444
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,920
 It was in its early stages.

445
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,680
 Can you imagine if a church was already corrupt from the very beginning?

446
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
 It wouldn't survive.

447
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,600
 It wouldn't outlive the Roman Empire.

448
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,400
 But yet it did, because its elders were called to uphold truth and to lead in purity.

449
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,680
 And then he tells Timothy, "You yourself, just keep pure.

450
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,160
 Keep pure in the sense of completely have your mind fully devoted to the Lord, and don't

451
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,640
 mix in, don't compromise."

452
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,640
 Because the first thing is indictment, and the second thing is appointment.

453
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,600
 He's saying, "Don't be hasty in the laying of hands."

454
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
 What is he talking about?

455
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,800
 He's saying, "Don't rush in appointing elders."

456
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,160
 And he talks about this in chapter three.

457
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,280
 He's saying, "Hey, if there are recent converts, don't suddenly make them overseers.

458
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,840
 Don't suddenly make them elders, lest they be puffed up with conceit and fall into condemnation."

459
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,840
 He's saying, "Recent converts, they're not there yet."

460
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,440
 And then he finishes this chapter with this interesting part in verse 24, "The sins of

461
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,920
 some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear

462
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
 later."

463
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,080
 He's saying, "You don't know someone's true colors until they've been tested.

464
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
 So be patient.

465
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,440
 Don't rush.

466
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,760
 Take your time.

467
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,360
 Let the challenges of the day reveal their character.

468
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,720
 But only then do you appoint them.

469
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 So don't rush."

470
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,920
 Timothy, I know you're under a lot of stress.

471
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,240
 I know you're under a lot of pressure, but don't rush in bringing people because you

472
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,880
 need to bring the right people.

473
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,160
 You don't just need to bring more people.

474
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,320
 So he keeps lifting this high charge, this higher calling to Timothy.

475
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,680
 And so no wonder he's a little bit stressed.

476
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,480
 So love everyone like family.

477
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
 Love everyone in need.

478
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,040
 Love those in need, and love everyone who leads.

479
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,840
 He lays down this more specific guideline for Timothy in this chapter with the whole

480
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,680
 goal of helping him to lead.

481
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,880
 So what does that mean for us?

482
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,840
 I guess the first question that we really need to reflect on is, do we, again, do we

483
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,360
 treat each other as family?

484
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,280
 Is there someone in your life right now, maybe you're sitting right next to them, that actually

485
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,440
 you need to treat more like family?

486
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,500
 Because this church is a family.

487
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,600
 And we, for better or for worse, are stuck with each other.

488
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,640
 But we are family, not just because we're trying to commit ourselves to each other to

489
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,520
 make something grow here, but we are family because of what Jesus did.

490
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,740
 Because of Jesus dying on the cross for us.

491
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,920
 We may not be blood family, but we are bound by the blood of Christ.

492
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,000
 And because of that, we can look across at our neighbor here and go, "You are my brother.

493
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,960
 You are my sister because of what Christ did."

494
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,280
 So we must love everyone like family.

495
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,200
 In a church here, when you walked in, it is true, you don't have friends.

496
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
 You have family.

497
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,600
 I think we, as a church here in Hong Kong, need to hear that loud and clear.

498
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,100
 Because I think so many of our problems comes from the fact that we don't see each other

499
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,800
 as family.

500
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,980
 And if we did, it would change the way we work.

501
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,400
 And love those in need.

502
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
 Why?

503
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
 Because it's what Jesus did.

504
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,240
 In Luke chapter 4, when Jesus announces himself into ministry, he goes to a synagogue, he

505
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,560
 opens up a scroll from the book of Isaiah, and he reads, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon

506
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,120
 me to proclaim good news."

507
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,260
 To who?

508
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,520
 To the poor, to the captive, to the oppressed, to the blind.

509
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,680
 You look at Jesus' life and what he did and the time he spent with people, it was those

510
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,860
 people in need.

511
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,680
 It was the people that we would struggle to spend time with.

512
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,280
 And that's exactly what he did.

513
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,160
 Because he did it, we must too.

514
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,360
 Because he, as we sang, he is the cornerstone.

515
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,440
 Everything that we do has to be based on what he did.

516
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,080
 And so we have to love those in need.

517
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,440
 So I ask you now, brothers and sisters, are there people that God has placed in your life

518
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,000
 surrounding you who are actually in need, who can do with you stepping in to their lives

519
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,520
 as family and looking after them?

520
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 And to love those who lead, to pray for your pastors, to pray for your leaders, to pray

521
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,480
 for your parents, to pray for the people who God has placed above you.

522
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,440
 Let us commit to loving everyone.

523
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,200
 And practically speaking, each of us here have a different situation to express that

524
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
 love out.

525
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,480
 But I hope even from looking at this chapter today, we can see some of these principles,

526
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,280
 that we can see the heart of God in how he wants us to operate as a church, which is

527
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,480
 to be family.

528
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,960
 Not friends, not acquaintances, not fellow attendees, but to be family.

529
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,960
 Let's pray.

530
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:58,520
 Father we come before you being able to say that very thing, that you are our father.

531
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:07,840
 Because of what Jesus did, we have now been adopted into your family.

532
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,480
 And I pray that you would just forgive us for not treating each other like family.

533
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:24,440
 Just like the passage that Gabriel read for us from Ephesians, that we are one body, all

534
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,280
 under your headship.

535
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,000
 So I pray that you would remind us of that day by day.

536
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,520
 That we would celebrate each other's triumphs.

537
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,760
 We would stand beside each other in the valleys.

538
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,200
 So that we would be as one, just as you prayed.

539
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:56,440
 That we would be as one so that the world will know that you exist.

540
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,920
 Holy Spirit I also pray that you would show us the people that you've placed around us

541
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,280
 who are actually in need.

542
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,280
 Give us the wisdom on how to love them.

543
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:12,600
 How to love them in a way that's filled with wisdom, filled with discernment.

544
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:21,560
 With the goal of facilitating and growing their godliness, drawing them closer to you.

545
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,200
 We pray for those who you've placed in leadership positions above us.

546
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,080
 With humble hearts we are grateful for them.

547
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,680
 We pray Lord that you would show us how to appreciate them, how to respect them, how

548
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:44,920
 to submit to them, and how to support them.

549
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,160
 Lord we know what your word says, that we are to treat each other as family.

550
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,640
 And I pray that you would give us the strength and the opportunities to live that out.

551
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,720
 We thank you.

552
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,560
 It's in your son's name we pray.

553
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,080
 Amen.

554
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:12,080
