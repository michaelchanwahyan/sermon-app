1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 Oh dear, Merry Christmas again everyone.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,680
 It's good to see you all.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,400
 Christmas Day is a very special day for my family and I.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,120
 Our kids woke up extra early today to do, what did we do?

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
 Open Christmas presents.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
 I did Google it, it's apparently the right day

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,840
 to open Christmas presents today.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,360
 Google's always right, and actually to be fair,

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,800
 every day is a good day to open presents.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,040
 And I was just thinking, you know what?

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,280
 We've made Christmas about a lot of things,

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,520
 and these two are threatening to make it

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,360
 about sloths and cats and llamas.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,880
 Of course, most saying that it's not about the jingle bells,

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,360
 but I love gift giving.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
 There's something about the exchange of gifts

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,600
 that is beautiful, that is exactly what Christmas is about.

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,640
 I don't know if you've all watched it yet,

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,640
 yesterday as a family, we watched the Netflix film,

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,920
 A Boy Called Christmas.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,080
 We had a hot pot and we just watched the movie together

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,240
 and one of the lines was, "Christmas is special

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,800
 "because it's the kindest day in the year."

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,000
 It's the kindest day, it's the day that we get

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,120
 this ultimate gift.

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,040
 So it isn't about the jingle bells, it's not about Santa,

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,040
 it's not about the Christmas trees necessarily.

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,560
 It's about the gift that was given to us.

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,600
 But somehow we've made Christmas about something

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,720
 very different, right?

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,360
 Even those of us who have grown up in the church,

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,640
 we know it's about Jesus and we say it's about Jesus,

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,600
 but then we make it about so many other things.

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,040
 Of course, that's us in the church,

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,760
 and in the world, of course, it's turned

36
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,480
 into this completely different thing.

37
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,440
 A couple weeks ago, we went into Landmark,

38
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
 the shopping center, we've been here for three years now,

39
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
 and one thing that still never ceases to amaze me

40
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,360
 is the shopping malls and the Christmas displays

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,280
 that go on there.

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,240
 They're just incredible.

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,800
 And the Landmark one is, actually I can't even describe,

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,840
 who's been to the Landmark Christmas display?

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,200
 Yeah, it's really quite hard to describe, right?

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,400
 There's just flying aliens, and I'll just leave it there.

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,160
 And I was just standing there going,

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,960
 what have flying aliens got to do with Christmas?

49
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,040
 I don't know, but it looks cool.

50
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,000
 I can't explain it, but it's not really Christmas.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,800
 So then it got me thinking, what is it about Christmas?

52
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,040
 It's definitely not flying aliens

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
 'cause that's too ridiculous.

54
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,920
 It's gotta be about, it's about baby Jesus.

55
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,240
 And then I stopped for a second and thought,

56
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,920
 isn't that quite ridiculous?

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,760
 Can you just pause for a second?

58
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,480
 Like when we say, oh, that's ridiculous,

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,840
 it's not about Santa, it's not about Christmas tree,

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,320
 it's about a baby.

61
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,400
 And you're like, well, what is it with the baby?

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
 But it's because the baby was the greatest gift

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,960
 that was ever given.

64
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,680
 It was read to us earlier, Isaiah chapter nine.

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,800
 The people were walking in deep darkness,

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,640
 but then a child is born, a son is given,

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,400
 and the government will be upon his shoulders,

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,080
 and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor,

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,480
 Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,240
 But still, to think that a baby

71
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,200
 caused this to happen is ridiculous.

72
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,960
 But just to give you a little bit more context for that,

73
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,800
 that was Isaiah nine.

74
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
 And this was by a prophet called Isaiah

75
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,320
 who lived 800 years before Jesus was even born.

76
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,480
 And the context of this is in Isaiah seven,

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,920
 he already said, and we had it read again,

78
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,360
 there will be a virgin that will conceive.

79
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,200
 Again, can we not just keep flying

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,720
 and being completely just nonchalant

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,520
 about these crazy claims about what is happening?

82
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
 A virgin conceives, what?

83
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,440
 And will give birth to, and God will be with you.

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,920
 Emmanuel, God is gonna be with you.

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,200
 So if you're an Israelite at that moment,

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,280
 you're being oppressed by a foreign nation.

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
 You must be like, God is finally gonna be with us.

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,160
 He's gonna be six, he's gonna be seven foot tall,

89
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,360
 and he's gonna help us destroy the enemies.

90
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,720
 And it will be, and then verse chapter nine,

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,240
 and it will be a child.

92
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,200
 It will be a baby.

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,880
 And this Christmas series, we've looked at shepherds,

94
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,280
 we've looked at angels, the wise men,

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,120
 and now we're looking at the baby Jesus.

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,840
 Why is it?

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,400
 What is so special about this baby

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,320
 that has caused this world to turn completely upside down?

99
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,920
 He split time in half, and now we, all of us,

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
 believers or not, will celebrate this day

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
 because of this baby.

102
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,480
 Have we ever stopped to think why?

103
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,640
 Why?

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,120
 Why do we keep exchanging these gifts

105
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
 and giving these gifts to each other?

106
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
 It's because there was a gift that was given to us.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,400
 A son was given to us.

108
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,160
 And of course, the greatest,

109
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,880
 the whole point of this was love, to show us love,

110
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
 to show us God's love,

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,200
 to show how deep the Father's love for us

112
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,760
 that he would give his only son to die for us.

113
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,520
 That's what it was to show us,

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
 but I think there's something else.

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,560
 I think Christmas, I think the baby Jesus

116
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,920
 teaches us something else.

117
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,040
 It's to show us love, but it's to teach us humility.

118
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,840
 It was to teach us humility,

119
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,480
 and that's what I'm gonna focus on today,

120
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,320
 at least for the next just 10 minutes or so.

121
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,960
 And I want us to think about this.

122
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,720
 Why did Jesus have to come as a baby,

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
 and why did he have to come the way he came?

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,240
 So just, again, it was read by Reuben to us earlier.

125
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,040
 So what happens in Luke chapter two is

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,480
 the Emperor Augustus, Caesar Augustus,

127
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,560
 who's the adopted son of the Julius Caesar,

128
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,160
 he orders a census that needs to be taken.

129
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,160
 So everyone needs to go back to their hometown.

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,800
 And Augustus himself is interesting.

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,920
 He's the first one, he's the first one who's emperor

132
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,160
 who's been called Augustus.

133
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,320
 And what does Augustus mean?

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,760
 Augustus means holy and revered.

135
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,600
 Why?

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
 Because the people wanted to appoint an emperor

137
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,400
 and appoint him as a god.

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,560
 They wanted to turn a man into god.

139
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,080
 What's interesting is this man who wanted to become god

140
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,520
 ends up ordering a census that then ushers in

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,760
 god who becomes man.

142
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,520
 So it's the pride of man that ushers in

143
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,640
 the arrival of this baby Jesus,

144
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,480
 where god himself becomes man, to show us humility.

145
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,920
 And can you imagine, for those of you who have been

146
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,120
 pregnant, who have given birth,

147
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,840
 who know what it's like to hold a baby within your womb,

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,320
 they got this news when Mary was just about to give birth.

149
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,960
 It wasn't far off, it was a week or two.

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,680
 So she was big and she was heavy.

151
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,240
 And they had to go from Nazareth back to Bethlehem.

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,360
 Can you imagine?

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,400
 And of course, this isn't, oh, okay, let's go back,

154
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,240
 I'm gonna call an Uber and we'll get back now.

155
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,640
 It's about 90 miles away.

156
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,840
 It would have taken about four, five days.

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,960
 Can you imagine, okay, Mary, of course,

158
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,120
 had to do all the bearing and all the carrying,

159
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,840
 but can you imagine, I can just imagine as a husband,

160
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,440
 as Joseph, I'm just like, you want me to take my very,

161
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,280
 very, very, very pregnant wife to walk through forests

162
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,280
 and valleys for five days to do this stupid census?

163
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,560
 And she could give birth at any moment.

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,360
 We could meet wild boars and we could all be going,

165
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,200
 what is it?

166
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,560
 But they had no choice, so they had to go.

167
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,120
 And Luke is very interesting.

168
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,720
 He tells us about Caesar Augustus.

169
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,000
 He tells us about the governor Quirinius.

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,080
 He tells us about Jesus.

171
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
 Why?

172
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,200
 To tell us that this really did happen.

173
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,680
 This wasn't just a fairy tale.

174
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,000
 This wasn't just a story.

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,320
 This was an event that actually happened.

176
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,040
 And so then they go on this journey

177
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,040
 and eventually they get to Bethlehem.

178
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,840
 Of course, as during this time,

179
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,200
 Bethlehem would have been completely crowded with people.

180
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 So then what did they do?

181
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
 They went looking.

182
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
 Usually they would have found a relative

183
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
 who they could stay with,

184
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,560
 but now they couldn't because the town was completely full.

185
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,720
 Their relatives probably had a full house themselves.

186
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,440
 So they said, don't worry, we'll go and find an inn,

187
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,320
 but the inns were full.

188
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,440
 And then they went looking around in all the inns

189
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
 and eventually, this is like trying to book

190
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,080
 a COVID quarantine hotel.

191
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,200
 And so they just kept looking and looking and looking

192
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,160
 until they couldn't find any.

193
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,760
 And there was one innkeeper that said, fine,

194
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,320
 there's no room, but I have a stable.

195
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,960
 I have a stable, which again,

196
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,520
 there probably weren't all kinds of animals there.

197
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,120
 There probably just have been donkeys and cows.

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,040
 And so they had no choice because actually at this point,

199
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
 Mary was probably contracting.

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,200
 Braxton Hicks, have we heard of those?

201
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,200
 Those attempts of trying to get the baby out.

202
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,080
 And then it's kind of like, oh my goodness, okay, fine.

203
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
 We'll take the stable.

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,880
 We'll take the stable with the donkey.

205
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
 I'll give birth there.

206
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,480
 And that's the context.

207
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,320
 But you see, why did God have to do it?

208
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,280
 You see, God used Jesus to turn the world upside down,

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,600
 to usher in his new kingdom.

210
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 Surely he would have made room for his son.

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,840
 You see, if it was you and I trying to save the world,

212
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,400
 we probably wouldn't have picked the smallest town.

213
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,480
 Micah 5.2.

214
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,640
 So Isaiah wrote this 800 years ago.

215
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,760
 Another 100 years after that,

216
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,480
 which is 700 years before Jesus,

217
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,080
 the prophet Micah says,

218
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,120
 oh you little town of Bethlehem.

219
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
 That's where the song comes from.

220
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
 A little town of Bethlehem.

221
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,840
 One of the smallest clans, Judah.

222
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,480
 From you will come, from you, out of you will come for me

223
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,080
 one who will be ruler over Israel,

224
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
 whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.

225
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,480
 Whose origins are from old, from ancient times.

226
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,040
 Which literally means,

227
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
 whose beginning is from the days of eternity.

228
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,040
 Why did God in all his power did not choose a big palace?

229
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,960
 You know from Bethlehem, one mile,

230
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,840
 there was King Herod's palace.

231
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,560
 He called it the Herodium.

232
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,760
 At 200 marble steps.

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,600
 It had a swimming pool

234
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,040
 that was twice the size of Olympic swimming pools.

235
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,680
 Why, if it was us, we would probably say,

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
 okay, this savior of the world,

237
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
 we're gonna have him born in the place

238
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
 right at the top of the hill.

239
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,200
 This palace that is filled with light and shine,

240
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,160
 so everyone can see that I'm here to save the world.

241
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
 No, he goes the opposite way.

242
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
 Why?

243
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,480
 To teach us something about humility.

244
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,120
 God came to transform this world,

245
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
 to rescue this mankind,

246
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,960
 to turn this world upside down,

247
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,880
 and he wanted to show us

248
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,640
 to not conform to the patterns of this world.

249
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,960
 And so he chose Bethlehem.

250
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,880
 He chose a stable.

251
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
 He became poor,

252
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,560
 so we could become rich.

253
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,120
 The Christmas story shows what love is,

254
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,880
 but it teaches us what humility is.

255
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,120
 And from there, we see that actually,

256
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,440
 Jesus grows up and shows more of humility.

257
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,640
 We have all heard this word before.

258
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
 What does the word humility mean?

259
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
 There's lots and lots of different definitions,

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,000
 but maybe to start with, to go with humility,

261
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,280
 let's have a look at the word pride.

262
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,720
 And again, there's lots of definitions.

263
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,920
 We all know what pride and humility are.

264
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,040
 There's lots of definitions of them.

265
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,080
 One of my personal favorites

266
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
 is by a man called Tim Keller, who said,

267
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,360
 "Pride is when you take credit

268
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
 "for something you don't deserve."

269
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,720
 It's an interesting angle on it.

270
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,560
 It's when you take credit

271
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
 for something that you don't deserve.

272
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,080
 Someone who's prideful is saying,

273
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,920
 "Oh, this was all me.

274
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,960
 "This is all about me."

275
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
 When actually, we all know that at a moment's notice,

276
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,840
 we could lose everything

277
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,120
 that we've ever worked hard for.

278
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
 So pride is taking credit

279
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,760
 for something that you don't deserve.

280
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,120
 For me, humility is knowing exactly what you are worth,

281
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,600
 knowing exactly what you are worth.

282
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,520
 And I've said this before.

283
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,120
 Pride and insecurity,

284
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
 even though they're opposite things,

285
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,440
 they're actually part of the same circle.

286
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,320
 Have you ever thought about why someone who is,

287
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
 why is someone prideful?

288
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,920
 Why is someone constantly wanting

289
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,840
 to tell you about themselves and boast?

290
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,800
 It's because they're feeling insecure,

291
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
 because they don't know their worth.

292
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,080
 And then someone who's insecure,

293
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,040
 why are they so insecure?

294
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,120
 Why do we feel, "Oh, I can't do anything."

295
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,080
 Who said, whoever said you could do anything?

296
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,400
 We can only do things through Christ.

297
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,440
 So actually, in some way,

298
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,400
 an insecure person is also prideful.

299
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,360
 So it's this circle, it's this cycle.

300
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,640
 And God uses the Christmas story,

301
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,440
 uses baby Jesus in a manger in Bethlehem

302
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,520
 to teach us humility.

303
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,720
 Again, it's been said plenty of times.

304
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,560
 Rick Warren has said this,

305
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,400
 C.S. Lewis has said it,

306
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,560
 but I think they probably said it the best,

307
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,800
 which was humility is not thinking any less of yourself.

308
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,320
 It's thinking of yourself less.

309
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,160
 It's not saying, "Oh, I can't do this,

310
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,640
 "I can't do that, I'm no good."

311
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,480
 No, it's not that.

312
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,240
 Humility, true humility,

313
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,840
 is when you just stop thinking about yourself full stop,

314
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,040
 when you recognize that it's not about you.

315
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,440
 'Cause here's the problem.

316
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,040
 When we have this, the world tells us,

317
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,640
 focus on yourself, get everything that you need,

318
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,040
 climb up this ladder so you can be at the top.

319
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
 The problem is, when it's just all about you,

320
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,000
 you recognize that you are imperfect,

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
 and it's never, never enough.

322
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,680
 That's what this story is trying to tell us,

323
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,760
 that you, on your own, if you are the end goal,

324
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,000
 if you are the end game, if you are the destination,

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,040
 it is not enough.

326
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,480
 Think about this culture that we live in right now,

327
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,520
 this selfie culture where it's all about us,

328
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,280
 where we put filters on our posts

329
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,480
 before we post anything out,

330
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,960
 because we want everyone to see us

331
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
 the way we want them to see us.

332
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,600
 This narcissistic culture that we live in,

333
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,160
 everything, do for you.

334
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,720
 Facebook listens to our conversations,

335
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,320
 and then pops us adverts of things that we kind of want,

336
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,240
 and so we keep seeing them,

337
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
 and eventually we buy them on Facebook,

338
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,400
 because they're just there all the time.

339
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,160
 Everything is just about you, satisfy you.

340
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
 But here's the problem.

341
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,200
 In this society where everything is encouraging you

342
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
 to make yourself happy, what do we end up with?

343
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,280
 We end up with the most people with depression.

344
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,960
 We end up with the most people with anxiety

345
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,400
 that we've ever known before.

346
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,560
 This, something doesn't add up

347
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,280
 when you just focus on yourself,

348
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
 when you try and complete, climb,

349
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,400
 and make achievements on this side.

350
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,320
 Something doesn't add up.

351
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,200
 It seems as though as you try to reach higher for this side,

352
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
 you only go lower and lower yourself.

353
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,520
 The Christmas story reminds us about humility.

354
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,040
 The key is to know our place and to know our worth,

355
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,600
 and Jesus did that not only as a baby,

356
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,280
 but also as a man.

357
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,480
 Luke chapter two, verse 52,

358
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
 he grows up in stature and wisdom.

359
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,200
 How did you see Jesus with his humility?

360
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,240
 With who he hung out with.

361
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,120
 He would associate with himself,

362
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,440
 with the outcasts of society,

363
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,640
 the poor, the children, the women.

364
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,360
 Throughout his whole life, he's showing us,

365
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,880
 and he's teaching us humility because he knew his worth,

366
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,440
 because he knew who he was.

367
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,680
 He knew what he was here for,

368
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,200
 and that's why he didn't mind being a baby born in a manger.

369
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 But instead, he knew exactly what his worth was.

370
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,400
 A no passage highlights this better,

371
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,440
 and I wanna borrow Reuben's lovely Bible here

372
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
 'cause it's a version that I've only just discovered,

373
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
 and it's quite nice to read.

374
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
 He knew what this was,

375
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,480
 and just this passage in Philippians

376
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,120
 just highlights it just in the most beautiful way.

377
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,640
 It was actually a song.

378
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,760
 Philippians chapter two.

379
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,440
 I realize I can't talk and scroll at the same time.

380
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
 I must be a male.

381
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,520
 Okay, here we go, I found it.

382
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,720
 Oh, multitasking, oh.

383
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,520
 Philippians chapter two, verse five.

384
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,360
 Let me read it to you, and you'll know it,

385
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,520
 but it's just a slightly different version.

386
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,560
 In your relationships with one another,

387
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,600
 have the same mindset as Christ Jesus.

388
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,920
 What is this mindset?

389
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,280
 Who, being in very nature God,

390
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,440
 did not consider equality with God

391
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,960
 something to be used to his own advantage.

392
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,120
 Rather, he made himself nothing

393
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,720
 by taking the very nature of a servant,

394
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,480
 being made in human likeness,

395
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,880
 and being found in appearance as a man.

396
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,520
 He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,

397
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,240
 even death on a cross.

398
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,440
 Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place

399
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,600
 and gave him the name that is above every name,

400
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
 that at the name of Jesus,

401
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,800
 every knee should bow in heaven and on earth

402
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 and under the earth,

403
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,320
 and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,

404
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,200
 to the glory of God the Father.

405
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,760
 There's this masterful way

406
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,200
 of talking about Christ's humility

407
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,080
 and then his exaltation,

408
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,400
 how he humbled himself.

409
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,000
 You see, Jesus was humble as a person living in this world

410
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,560
 with what he did, who he associated with,

411
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,000
 but his most humble act

412
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,080
 was coming from heaven to earth

413
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,720
 when he considered equality with God

414
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,840
 something that he could let go.

415
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,040
 And he emptied himself to die for us

416
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,760
 to the point of death and death on a cross.

417
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,680
 I think Christmas is an appropriate time

418
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,320
 for us to recalibrate,

419
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,920
 to recalibrate, to remind ourselves that it's not about us.

420
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,000
 But in the story, in the true story,

421
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,840
 an event of the Messiah being born in a manger,

422
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,040
 he shows us love and he teaches us humility,

423
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,160
 the greatest gift that was given.

424
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,200
 As we exchange gifts this Christmas,

425
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,200
 let us remember that Jesus exchanged things for us too.

426
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,920
 He took in death and gave us life.

427
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,000
 He took in shame so we could be free.

428
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,920
 He took in our darkness and he shone in the light.

429
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,240
 He took on the wages of our sin

430
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,640
 so we could be written in the pages of heaven.

431
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:55,240
 That exchange, that humble exchange,

432
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,240
 that beautiful exchange is the reason why we sit here today.

433
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,840
 It's the reason why we get to celebrate.

434
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,840
 It's the reason for the season.

435
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,680
 Let us pray.

436
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:22,000
 Jesus, we come before you and we humble ourselves.

437
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,800
 This Christmas, we commit to thinking of ourselves less.

438
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,960
 But right now, as the ladies read,

439
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,040
 this season is all about thinking

440
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,360
 and caring for those in need.

441
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,160
 Not out of sympathy or charity,

442
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,160
 but because we realize and we recognize

443
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,080
 that we were in need,

444
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,560
 that we were in need of a Savior and you came to save us.

445
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,560
 So Jesus, we come before you and we bow down

446
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,560
 and we just recognize how loving you are to us.

447
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,640
 Would you show us once again,

448
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,720
 especially during this Christmas season,

449
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,760
 how to be made in your image,

450
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,640
 to be dressed with love and humility in this season.

451
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,000
 We thank you for saving us.

452
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
 Thank you for saving us.

453
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,040
 It's in your name we pray, amen.

454
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,720
 Just before I pass over to the worship team,

455
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,760
 there's this wonderful quote,

456
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,360
 just highlighting our need for a Savior.

457
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
 A.W. Tozer writes,

458
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,680
 "If our greatest need had been information,

459
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,840
 "God would have sent an educator.

460
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,360
 "If our greatest need had been technology,

461
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,160
 "God would have sent us a scientist.

462
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,480
 "If our greatest need had been money,

463
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,200
 "God would have sent us an economist.

464
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,160
 "If our greatest need had been pleasure,

465
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,120
 "God would have sent us an entertainer.

466
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,280
 "Our greatest need was for forgiveness.

467
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,760
 "So God sent us a Savior."

468
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,340
 (gentle music)
