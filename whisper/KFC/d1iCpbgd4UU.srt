1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 And thank you, Hank, for reading that.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,720
 Now I was trying to get a wise man to read the passage, and I think we did get one.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
 Now good evening.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,840
 So I'm just really glad to be here as we continue this series.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,080
 And as we've just read, it's about the wise man or the magi, or sometimes if I mistakenly,

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,940
 I would say Maggie.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,980
 So anyways, if you'll hear all those, we're referring to the wise man.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,440
 But before we start, I do want to ask you a few questions, okay?

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:45,920
 Which is, now, if we were to think of a wise man in the movie Star Wars, okay, which character

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,080
 would it be?

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,000
 Now I want to give you a hint, okay, which is it's not Darth Vader, okay?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,080
 Now who would it be if you were to choose someone, a character?

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
 Huh?

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
 Yoda.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
 Yes, it's Master Yoda.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,680
 Let's get him on, Master Yoda.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,760
 And he is this green-looking, small alien, and yet he possess this power that he's able

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,320
 to train all of the master Jedis.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,240
 But nowhere do we know where he came from, and he's classified as the unknown species.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,000
 All right, another chance if you didn't get the first one.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,120
 So what about in the movie Matrix?

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,040
 If we were to find a character that would resemble the wise man or wise woman, who would

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
 it be?

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,360
 Now I also have a clue for you, and that is not Agent Smith, okay?

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,760
 All right, if you're laughing, that means you know what I'm talking about, but does

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,120
 anybody have any idea who the wise person is?

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,380
 Yes.

28
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,280
 So the Oracle, I heard it.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
 Good job.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,000
 This is a collective wisdom here, okay?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,200
 So it is the Oracle, the one on the right.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,800
 And she possessed the power to tell the future, or she knows what's going to happen, of course

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,040
 up to the free will of that person.

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,160
 All right, the next question.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,840
 And of course we don't know much about her either, but that she helps the people to fight

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,440
 against this matrix.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,680
 So the last chance if you didn't get the first two.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,440
 Now who would be the wise man in KFC?

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,760
 Okay, all right.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,080
 Okay, don't answer that one, okay?

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,240
 There are too many.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,640
 That's the answer.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,960
 And so when we talk about wise men, we tend to think of someone kind of mysterious.

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,520
 We don't know much about...

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,440
 This picture comes to mind, right?

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,520
 But somehow they possess some sort of power or knowledge that's beyond the average population.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,080
 So this is the kind of wise man or the magi that we're also looking at today.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,840
 Now the magi that we were looking at, we saw that they possessed this power and they were

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,240
 able to see what the stars meant.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,000
 They were able to link it together with the birth of the King of Jews.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,400
 And I believe that, and also with many scholars, we're going to show here the prophecy by Balaam,

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:29,600
 which is in Numbers 24, 17, where it says that, "I see him, but not now.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,840
 I behold him, but not near.

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,280
 A star will come out of Jacob.

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,800
 A scepter will rise out of Israel."

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,880
 Now we believe that he was able to connect that star with his astronomic knowledge and

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,280
 see that it is the King of Jews.

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,560
 And yet he is not a Jew himself, at least not set by the Bible, but he's just someone

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,200
 who came from the East.

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,920
 And as far as we know, it's probably about 900 miles away.

61
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,960
 Now what does that mean?

62
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
 How long is 900 miles?

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,720
 Anybody know?

64
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,040
 How many hours of drive is that, 900 miles?

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,320
 Driving at the speed of 65 kilometers an hour.

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,040
 If you're not speeding, you'll get there within 14 hours of drive.

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,660
 So it actually took them about several months to get there.

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,480
 And so in this story, as it unfolds, we see that they were looking for this infant Jesus,

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,720
 and then where would they go?

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,800
 It actually was quite logical for them to go to Jerusalem because that was the city

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,040
 of the royalties.

72
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,880
 That's where even King David was born.

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,560
 So it's natural for them, if they're looking for the King, to go there first.

74
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,880
 But instead of finding Jesus, they found King Herod and alert him that there is this King

75
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,080
 who was born.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,880
 And so as the story unfolds, Herod tells him by asking all the priests and the teachers

77
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,320
 of law, where would he be?

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,140
 And we know from the prophecies that he's going to be born, or he was born, in Bethlehem.

79
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,540
 And so they head out, and the star reappeared, and eventually landed in the home where Mary

80
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,240
 was with Jesus.

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:19,160
 And they bow down to him, and he served, and they gave homage to him, really just to praise

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,600
 him and to give him these gifts.

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,040
 So this is kind of how this story started.

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,920
 And eventually, then they've received a dream from the angels telling them, "Don't go there.

85
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,820
 Don't go back to Herod, but instead, go to another route."

86
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,760
 And Joseph also received a dream from the angels telling him to flee with Mary and Jesus

87
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,680
 to Egypt.

88
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,500
 And so after King Herod found out, what did he do?

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,400
 He killed all of the infants around the age under two years old in Bethlehem.

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
 So we kind of have this setting.

91
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,340
 I just wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page about what's happening.

92
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,340
 Now the very first thing that I do want to say is that today we're going to focus on

93
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:12,300
 how these wise men had worshipped God in a way that maybe you and I haven't, and for

94
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,980
 us to have a glimpse.

95
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,460
 So when I say the word "worship," I mean, what do you think of?

96
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
 How do we worship?

97
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
 What is worship?

98
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
 Anyone?

99
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,460
 Throw some answers out.

100
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
 How do you...

101
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
 Huh?

102
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,460
 - Praying.

103
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
 - Praying.

104
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,940
 Okay, thank you, Jackie, all the way from back there.

105
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,980
 What about up front on this side?

106
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
 What else?

107
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
 - Praises.

108
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,980
 - Praises, okay, singing songs or going to church.

109
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,660
 So we'll see the slide where we see that there are different ways and we picture what worship

110
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
 is like.

111
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,780
 However, today we're going to see it quite differently than from what these magi, these

112
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,300
 wise men are showing us.

113
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,860
 And the very first point that we want to go to is that it is important for us to worship

114
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,180
 God as a priority.

115
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,300
 Now they have done so in a few ways, okay?

116
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,660
 The first way that they have set God as a priority was as soon as they saw the star,

117
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,040
 they head out to find this newborn.

118
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 Now think about it.

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,820
 If you and I were in their shoes, even with all the expertise that we have, we're looking

120
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,340
 at a star and I've looked at many stars and they all look pretty much the same, okay?

121
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,820
 And how do they with certainty know that this is the star of the newborn king?

122
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,180
 I mean, when we look up, does it have an arrow that says, "This is it," and it's got a title,

123
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,300
 Star of the King of Jews?

124
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
 Probably not.

125
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,380
 So there might be some doubt, you know, is that really the star?

126
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,540
 But anyways, let's say for argument's sake, let's say they're 100% sure this is the star.

127
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,400
 So they start heading out.

128
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,420
 But won't you and I, if we were them, start to have doubt?

129
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,180
 Are we really going to find this infant?

130
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,900
 I mean, it's miles and miles away and we're not sure if we're going to be robbed along

131
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
 the way or killed.

132
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,480
 And I mean, when we get there, we will really find him?

133
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:15,140
 So the first thing that I want us to look at is that we need to prioritize God over

134
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,660
 any doubts that we have.

135
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,420
 Maybe sometimes there are doubts in your life too.

136
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,840
 Maybe situations are not exactly how you want them to be.

137
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,020
 But will we be able to, like the wise men, just not to fear, but then to take a risk

138
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,780
 with God, knowing that when we prioritize him, even in the midst of doubt, I mean, even

139
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:46,060
 if they didn't find him, they were willing to go all the way to find Jesus.

140
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,620
 Will we, in the midst especially of our trials, have this priority?

141
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,620
 And the second thing is he prioritized his time.

142
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
 Now think about it.

143
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,460
 It was a few months worth of travel.

144
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,820
 I don't know about you, but I think they would have their own family, maybe a job.

145
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,740
 And these are most likely religious leaders or political leaders, and they have their

146
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,040
 duties to perform.

147
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,740
 And what did they do?

148
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,380
 They put down everything, their entire timetable.

149
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,100
 And it's also a question for us to think about.

150
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,020
 I mean, do we put down our timetable?

151
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:32,620
 I mean, do we go through the business of our day, and eventually we get to nighttime and

152
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,420
 we carve out that two minutes that we pray to God?

153
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:43,660
 Or do we carve out the best of our timetable, putting everything aside to ensure that we

154
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,500
 have quality time with him?

155
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:56,180
 And the third thing that we see is that the wise men prioritize God before anyone.

156
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,500
 Now think about it.

157
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,820
 When they were about to travel back, they would have gone back to Herald.

158
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,700
 But instead, because of what the angel said, they did not go back to Herald and went another

159
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,700
 way.

160
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,180
 But think about it.

161
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,780
 They have actually risked their lives to do that because Herald is a king.

162
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,900
 And if he knew that these wise men have played him, he could easily send out troops or soldiers

163
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,860
 to go after them.

164
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,620
 And yet, the wise men were willing to prioritize God first.

165
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,000
 And that's something for us to think about.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,500
 Do we prioritize what God says, or do we care more about what people think of us?

167
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,060
 Do we care more about whether or not we'll get fired at our job or get higher grades

168
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,200
 or other benefits?

169
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,820
 And that's something for us to think about.

170
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:00,060
 So the first one I really want to share is that we need to prioritize God in our worship.

171
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,480
 Whether it's our time, whether it's people that we care about, or rather it's in those

172
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,820
 moments where we have doubts.

173
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,600
 We still need to prioritize him.

174
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,340
 Now as we read on, we see that as the wise men went and they went to Bethlehem, they

175
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,360
 saw this house and there was an infant, a toddler, because Jesus was most likely not

176
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,980
 in his baby stage, but closer to a year old or a year and a half.

177
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,480
 And what we see is in verse 11 it says, "On coming to the house, they saw the child with

178
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,640
 his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him.

179
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,780
 Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and

180
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,520
 myrrh."

181
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,440
 And now at seeing Jesus, they didn't walk in and start sitting down and having a cup

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
 of tea and chat with Mary, how are things going?

183
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,880
 They don't see themselves at the same level, but what they did immediately was they bowed

184
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,200
 down because this is the king that they have been searching.

185
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,560
 This is the king of Jews.

186
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,880
 And so immediately also they brought out the gifts that they have for Jesus.

187
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,760
 Of course my question to you and also to me is, what about us?

188
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,760
 When we go to worship God, do we have this kind of reverence for God?

189
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,120
 I mean, one thing is, I mean, how on time do we come for worship?

190
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,160
 Okay, don't answer that, you know it yourself.

191
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,600
 Or how willing are we to give to God?

192
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,660
 Do we give the treasures that we cherish the most?

193
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,120
 Or instead, do we not even have a gift?

194
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,880
 Maybe many a times we don't have a gift for this king.

195
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,320
 What do we have for him?

196
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,720
 Do you know?

197
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,680
 We have our troubles, our issues, things we can't take care of, our health problems.

198
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,200
 That's what we bring to him.

199
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,760
 We're not bringing him any gift.

200
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
 Well, sometimes we do.

201
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
 And so that's also for us to think about.

202
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:22,640
 Looking at the wise men, they went all the way, not with their problems, but with gifts.

203
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,360
 And this baby Jesus, he's a toddler.

204
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,560
 He's not going to perform miracles and they're not doing anything.

205
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,920
 But really just to praise him.

206
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:42,000
 And you know, these three kinds of items, these gifts that they have, is fit for someone

207
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,520
 very special.

208
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,920
 It's fit for a king.

209
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,680
 It's fit for a savior.

210
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,640
 It's fit for God.

211
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,720
 Now let's look at that.

212
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,960
 So the first thing is gold.

213
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
 Okay.

214
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,440
 Gold as we know is the ultimate, most valuable element in those times.

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,280
 And so they're presenting the most precious thing to him.

216
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,520
 And really many scholars also say that this might symbolize the identity of who Jesus

217
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,080
 was and is, which is the king.

218
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,560
 Jesus is the king.

219
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,640
 And so they brought gold for him for this particular identity.

220
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,480
 And the next thing is, is frankincense.

221
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,560
 Now frankincense is a rosin from a particular tree.

222
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,800
 It was actually an imported good.

223
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 Okay.

224
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,080
 And what it was used for is that it's burnt incense during the worship.

225
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,120
 And so this particular gift was made for God.

226
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,080
 So it's really worshiping him as the God of the universe.

227
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,640
 And the last thing is myrrh.

228
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,960
 It is actually used for the embalmment of dead bodies.

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,040
 And many say that it probably represented the suffering and the death and the resurrection

230
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,420
 of Jesus.

231
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:08,480
 And what that meant was that they were worshiping him as a savior.

232
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 That identity.

233
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,920
 Now, rather or not, these wise men knew what they were presenting.

234
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,600
 We don't really know.

235
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,840
 But what we do see is that these are great gifts.

236
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,400
 And what about us?

237
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,760
 Today, what do we have prepared for Jesus, for God?

238
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,280
 What about you?

239
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,240
 And sometimes, you know, I think for myself, you know, when I tithe, I might forget this

240
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,360
 week's tithe and I might write it for next month instead or the month after that.

241
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,880
 But how many of us actually prepare our checks, maybe even before our paycheck comes, and

242
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,480
 they're ready to tithe their first fruits, their best part of it to God?

243
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,840
 Or when we talk about serving God or volunteering, how many of us are like, "Yeah, the church

244
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,720
 needs that and I'm going to serve there next week."

245
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,400
 Yes, the vesters clapping.

246
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
 Right?

247
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 Or we're like, "Oh, you know, think about it.

248
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,200
 Maybe if no one goes, you know."

249
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,480
 And like we're serving God if it's like out of pity.

250
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,600
 Or maybe because you don't want to see that announcement anymore.

251
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,280
 And then you go and serve, right?

252
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,440
 But look at these wise men.

253
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,240
 They were not like that.

254
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,520
 They were traveling all the way.

255
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,400
 They were prepared to give what they have to God.

256
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,720
 And so let us be reminded of that as well.

257
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,320
 And there's a great expression that John Piper eloquently puts together.

258
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,440
 And I want to share that with you.

259
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,360
 And it says, "The gifts are intensifiers of desire for Christ himself."

260
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,560
 In much the same way that fasting is, when you give a gift to Christ like this, it's

261
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,240
 a way of saying, "The joy that I pursue is not the hope of getting rich with things from

262
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 you.

263
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,440
 I have not come to you for your things, but for yourself.

264
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:17,080
 And this desire I now intensify and demonstrate by giving up things in the hope of enjoying

265
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,400
 you more, not things.

266
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,440
 By giving to you what you do not need and what I might enjoy, I am saying more earnestly

267
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:33,400
 and more authentically, you are my treasure, not these things."

268
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,720
 And we should really look and reflect, what are we giving to God?

269
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:46,160
 Are we looking at him as if he's our treasure or the leftovers?

270
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,380
 We need to really think about that.

271
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,840
 And this actually nicely brings us to our third point, which is we need to worship God

272
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,080
 for just who he is.

273
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,960
 Now up to this point, when we looked at the entire story, there was nothing else, and

274
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,320
 I mean nothing else that these wise men wanted other than one thing, which is to worship

275
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 God.

276
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,680
 They did not go to him with a disease that they have, and they did not go trying to become

277
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:25,680
 richer, and they did not go trying to get anything, but only to worship God.

278
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,080
 Now I want to share with you about maybe two months ago, I was having lunch actually with

279
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,780
 Pastor Peter, and he was sharing with me about a testimony.

280
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,580
 And it was about a young lady, she's about to graduate from school and she lives in Canada.

281
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,380
 And so she was trying to get a job before she would graduate.

282
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,980
 Many students do that to make sure that they secure a spot.

283
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,860
 And so she applied and of course she got a job from the National Bank of Canada, which

284
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,220
 is a good job.

285
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,700
 And so she signed it, signed the offer and was ready for it.

286
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,420
 And as she was still continuing the rest of her study, another offer came in, and it was

287
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,820
 from Morgan Stanley in the States.

288
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:16,660
 So it was a great opportunity for her to explore and kind of just find out more about how it

289
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:22,720
 is to work at a more prestigious bank and to have that experience.

290
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,880
 And so as I was listening, I kind of interrupted and I said, "Oh yeah, of course take the Morgan

291
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,060
 Stanley job because she hasn't started yet, right?

292
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,220
 This would be like great for a youngster, go for it."

293
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,100
 Of course, Pastor Peter did not say that.

294
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,140
 He was like, "Oh," and then I told her to stick with her original job.

295
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,220
 I'm like, "Oh, okay."

296
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,280
 But the reason being is because he said as she had signed that offer, it was already

297
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:58,620
 some sort of agreement and she should try to honour that, try to honour that signature,

298
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,220
 try to honour it for God.

299
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,940
 And I was, "Yeah, okay."

300
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,820
 And so as the story unfolds, when she first signed it, it was in 2019, okay?

301
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,460
 And then she was studying until the May of 2020.

302
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,580
 And of course, as we all know, COVID hit.

303
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,940
 And so all of her friends that have signed up to work in the States, everything was put

304
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,860
 to halt and they did not have a job.

305
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,460
 On the other hand, because she had honoured God and listened to Pastor Peter, I'm glad

306
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:38,420
 she did not ask me, you know, but maybe God would have given me something to give her.

307
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,660
 And so she had her job and everything was fine.

308
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,540
 So listening to that, I was very motivated myself.

309
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,340
 I'm like, "Oh yeah, I got to go out there and then I got to do everything honouring

310
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 God.

311
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,220
 Oh yeah, I'm so ready for it."

312
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,820
 And so the next day, I was still ready for it the next day.

313
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,580
 I still am.

314
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,100
 And so the next day, I happened to have dinner with, well, I happen to have dinner with Philemon.

315
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,300
 I mean, we have it all the time.

316
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,700
 But we happened to go to Sky 100.

317
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,940
 We're going to show this, yeah, which is on top of ICC, okay?

318
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,820
 So we're just enjoying ourselves and see Cafe 100.

319
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,020
 And you know what we do kind of like tourists now, because we can't get out of Hong Kong,

320
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
 right?

321
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,500
 So we go to the souvenir store.

322
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,480
 Ha ha, souvenir store.

323
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,660
 So I was there and it was around like a Halloween time, okay?

324
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,860
 And you know, ladies, I'm not sure I can speak for all ladies, but just looking around for

325
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
 some good stuff.

326
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,340
 And so looking at some Legos, you know, I like cute stuff.

327
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,740
 And there was one where it was Cinderella with the theme of a Halloween.

328
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,820
 Yeah, there we go.

329
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
 That's what it looked like.

330
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,580
 And I was like, "Oh, this is so cute."

331
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,980
 But remembering the story or the testimony that Pastor Peter said, and I was like, "Okay,

332
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,800
 I should try to, you know, my best, give my very best to God, honor Him as much as I could."

333
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,320
 And so I felt like as a Christian, not to mention a pastor, buying a Halloween, like

334
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,260
 this, all right, might be a little bit too much.

335
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,360
 So okay, I offer the second best.

336
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,480
 It was something else.

337
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,200
 Don't worry about that one.

338
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 And so I'm like, "Okay, I'll get something."

339
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,880
 So feeling quite good about myself, you know, came honoring God.

340
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,540
 And after we paid, you know, as I was just walking away and about to get to the cafe

341
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,200
 where we'll eat, you know, I have this thought.

342
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:39,580
 I was like, "Did I worship God because of God alone?

343
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:46,800
 Or did I worship God because I was hoping for His protection or His blessing, just like

344
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,740
 that testimony I heard?"

345
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,340
 And I, you know, I struggled a little bit as I was walking away, and if I have to be

346
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:03,060
 very truthful, I have to say that I was worshiping God, but with the intent that maybe when I

347
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,560
 do it, something good will happen.

348
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,680
 Maybe I'll be protected.

349
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,280
 And I, you know, as I think, I'm like, "Okay, if the testimony had been different, if she

350
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:21,000
 gets signed on and calamity happened," and I was like, "Okay, maybe I won't be as motivated

351
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 to do it."

352
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,960
 And just that thought about the purity in our worship makes us or made me have another

353
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,440
 thought.

354
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:41,340
 When I say I worship God, is there somewhere down deep inside of my heart somewhere that's

355
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:49,280
 actually wanting more from Him, some sort of blessing, some sort of protection?

356
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,520
 But look at these wise men.

357
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:02,560
 They wanted nothing but Jesus to be in His presence to worship Him because He's the King,

358
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,200
 He's the God, and He is our Savior who gave us Jesus and that He would die for us and

359
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,700
 wipe out our sins.

360
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,840
 Is that not enough for us to worship Him, but to have other agendas?

361
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,440
 Now I'm not saying that we cannot pray for our needs, okay?

362
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,960
 I don't want us to stop asking God for things because He is our Heavenly Father and He even

363
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,280
 told us to ask for things.

364
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,720
 It's okay to ask, but it's also a question that we need to think about in our heart.

365
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,200
 Are we just doing certain things so we can kind of get some benefits?

366
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,560
 And if we are, we need to be very careful.

367
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:49,640
 That kind of worship might not be as pure as we'd like to think.

368
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,000
 And so it's very easy for us to find out, you know, which is like when we read our Bible

369
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,280
 or when we go to church or when we pray, when we think we're doing things that God likes,

370
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,120
 following His path, you know, do you have that sense that, okay, you know, I've done

371
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,120
 all these, I've been the good kid, not the Santa Claus, but you know, God will then look

372
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,880
 after me.

373
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
 And you're like, well, how do I know if I do that?

374
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,320
 Well, just flip it over, okay?

375
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,600
 Just reverse it.

376
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,160
 If something bad happened, do you think, oh, did I miss reading my Bible?

377
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
 Did I not pray?

378
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,120
 Did I cheat someone and hence this is happening?

379
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:33,160
 Because if you do, then maybe when you were doing those things, you were hoping to have

380
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,640
 some other benefits.

381
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,600
 But let us be reminded by the wise man that when we worship Him, it's just because He

382
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,960
 is almighty God, because He's the creator, because He loves us, because He's ready to

383
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,080
 give everything that He has for us.

384
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:03,800
 And there's no greater reason to worship and to praise Him other than just who He is.

385
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,560
 And so I challenge all of you and for myself also, that when we look at the wise man, let

386
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,040
 us worship Him by prioritizing Him above everything.

387
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:25,680
 Rather you have doubts, rather you're a very busy person, and just not worry about what

388
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,520
 other people think or say.

389
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,640
 Just prioritize Him.

390
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,160
 He is your priority.

391
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,680
 Second thing is be prepared to give Him.

392
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,600
 It's not about taking things from Him if you want to worship Him.

393
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,960
 It's about giving with gladness, with thanksgiving, and with your gifts, things that are important

394
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,120
 to you.

395
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:55,080
 And thirdly, really, let us worship Him for just who He is and nothing else.

396
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,720
 Don't mix it in with a little bit of your own agenda, but entirely just for God, because

397
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,520
 He's worthy.

398
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:12,580
 And so today just allow us to reexamine our heart and let our worship be from our hearts

399
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,680
 to Him, as pure as it can be.

400
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,520
 Let us pray together.

401
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,640
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for just who you are.

402
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,920
 You're the God Almighty, the glorious one, and you're the one who loves us so much that

403
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,920
 you gave us Jesus.

404
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:42,440
 And Father, help us as we mature in our Christian walk, that Father, maybe before we went to

405
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:53,440
 you with problems and issues, but let us now go to you in your presence to worship you

406
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,320
 because of who you are.

407
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,560
 Let us prioritize you.

408
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,360
 And Father, help us in our weakness.

409
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,880
 Help us during the times when we have our own desires and wishes.

410
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,680
 Let us be fulfilled by you and you alone.

411
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,120
 Help us have the right heart to worship you.

412
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,560
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
