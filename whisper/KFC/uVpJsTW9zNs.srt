1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Thank you, Pastor John.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 We're continuing our series on the book of Ezekiel.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,200
 And who's enjoyed the series so far?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,300
 Yeah, that's good.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,800
 Okay, some of you haven't read it yet,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,900
 so haven't enjoyed it yet.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,000
 It's all good.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,200
 Today, the life, the topic is,

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,900
 is life a dead-end street?

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,500
 And Pastor John last week spoke on chapter five,

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,300
 and he spoke on three sort of main points.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,100
 Don't rob God, don't rob others,

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,800
 don't rob yourself.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,100
 And he talked about these illusions of wealth, right?

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,500
 Illusions, things that aren't really true,

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,700
 aren't really there.

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,300
 If you watch Spider-Man, Far From Home,

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,400
 there's a lot of illusions there, right?

19
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,800
 Wealth brings satisfaction, that's an illusion.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,300
 Wealth solves all problems.

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,900
 Wealth brings peace of mind.

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,600
 Wealth brings security.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,100
 These were the different illusions

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,600
 that Pastor John talked about last week.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,300
 And the preacher continues in chapter six.

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,600
 He talks about this problem

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
 that we have in this world.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
 And if you see the next slide,

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,700
 the problem a lot of us have

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,700
 is that we think the grass is greener on the other side,

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,700
 literally greener on the other side.

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
 You know, I'm from Canada,

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,600
 and I often have people that come up to me

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,500
 and say, "Oh, Canada, it's such a great place.

35
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,700
 "I really want to go there.

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,600
 "You know, it's like the Promised Land,

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
 "flowing with milk and honey."

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 And I'm like, "Yeah, Canada has its good and its bad,

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,300
 "but Hong Kong also has its good and its bad.

40
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,700
 "Is grass really greener in Canada?

41
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,300
 "Well, maybe not in winter.

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,100
 "You can't see the grass.

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,100
 "It's probably very yellow, just like this, under the snow."

44
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,800
 The problem in this world right now that we have

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,100
 is that we think the grass is often greener on the other side.

46
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,100
 There's a question on the next slide, and it says this.

47
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,600
 "If only I had, then I would be happy."

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,100
 What's the first thing that comes up in your mind?

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,100
 For some of you, it might be sleep.

50
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
 Condo? Yeah? Name it out. Name it out.

51
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,100
 If I only had, I would be--

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
 You would have happiness?

53
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
 You're not happy? Together? I'm joking.

54
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,100
 [laughs]

55
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,100
 Some people think, "Oh, if I only had, you know, this car," right?

56
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,600
 A Ferrari or something like that.

57
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
 "If I only had a house," it's hard to afford a house in Hong Kong.

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 "If I only had, oh, this wife or a girlfriend or a family," right?

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,100
 Some people are very connected to that.

60
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,100
 "If I only had, you know, children," right?

61
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,600
 "If I only had children, then I would be happy.

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,100
 "Our marriage would be happy.

63
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,100
 "If I only had this job, if I had only this position,

64
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,600
 "then I would be happy."

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,100
 We all try to fill our hearts, as we see in the next slide.

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:22,600
 We try to fill our hearts with things that often don't satisfy.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,100
 You know, I get that new phone, and it's nice for how long?

68
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
 A couple days, right? Two days.

69
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,100
 And then it's back to normal. It does the same sort of things.

70
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,100
 You know, I see people who've wanted a relationship for so long,

71
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
 and then they finally get a relationship,

72
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,100
 and then they're like, you know,

73
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,100
 "God, can I get out of this relationship?"

74
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,600
 It happens.

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 We buy something, we get into something

76
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,100
 that we think is greener on the other side,

77
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,100
 but at the end, it doesn't satisfy.

78
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,100
 And that's sort of the problem we have in this world.

79
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,600
 It's sort of like a dead end at times, right?

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
 It seems like no matter what we do,

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
 we fill our life with stuff,

82
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 but it just doesn't satisfy.

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 There's a disease. This disease is called discontentment.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,100
 Discontentment, according to the Internet,

85
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
 the definition is this,

86
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:34,600
 the lack of satisfaction with one's possessions, status, or situation.

87
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,600
 Lack of satisfaction with one's possessions, status, or situation.

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,100
 Is anybody feeling dissatisfied today? Discontent today?

89
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,100
 The definition of contentment is the opposite.

90
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:59,100
 Thankful to God who has given one's possessions, status, or situation.

91
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,600
 You're thankful.

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 We're going to play a game tonight.

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
 It's called "Would You Rather?"

94
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,600
 Who's played it before? Would you rather?

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
 Yeah? Good.

96
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 For those who didn't put up their hand, we'll teach you how to play.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,100
 So number one, here's the situation here.

98
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
 Be careful.

99
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,600
 So those who don't participate,

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
 we'll invite you up to have a just dance afterwards,

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,100
 just to keep you sharp tonight.

102
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,600
 So you notice those around you who don't participate,

103
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 at the end, you're going to have a just dance with Pastor John.

104
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,600
 Would you rather have wealth, possessions, and honor,

105
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,100
 and not be able to enjoy it,

106
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,600
 or situation B, have very little wealth, possessions, and honor,

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 and be able to enjoy it?

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,100
 So let's do it again.

109
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,600
 Would you rather have wealth, possessions, and honor,

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,100
 and not be able to enjoy it, situation A,

111
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,100
 or situation B, have very little wealth, possessions, and honor,

112
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
 and be able to enjoy it?

113
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,100
 Okay. For those who want situation A, raise their hand.

114
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
 Situation A.

115
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,600
 You don't want a position?

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,100
 Possessions, wealth, and honor?

117
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,100
 You don't want those things?

118
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
 Are you sure? Are you sure?

119
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
 Think about it. Okay.

120
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,100
 All right. Who wants situation B? Raise your hand.

121
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
 Okay. All right. Good.

122
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
 I'm noting those who haven't raised their hand.

123
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,100
 They're coming up for a just dance afterwards.

124
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
 And the preacher says this, right?

125
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,600
 He starts off, "There is an evil that I've seen under the sun,

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,100
 and it lies heavy on mankind."

127
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
 What is this evil?

128
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
 What is this evil?

129
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,100
 Well, if we look at chapter 5,

130
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
 and we look at this chapter,

131
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,100
 last chapter, he's talking about, you know,

132
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
 God has given us all these things, right?

133
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,100
 But we can't seem to enjoy it, right?

134
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,100
 And so he's talking about discontentment, I believe.

135
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
 This discontentment.

136
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,100
 And he's saying that in this first situation,

137
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,100
 one person can have wealth, possessions, and honor, right?

138
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,100
 But it doesn't guarantee contentment.

139
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,100
 It doesn't guarantee contentment.

140
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,100
 Right? We look at the movie stars.

141
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
 We think, "Wow, they have wealth.

142
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
 They have possessions.

143
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,100
 They have fame. They have sort of honor."

144
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,100
 Right? But shouldn't they be content?

145
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,100
 Or we look at, you know, some rich people in our lives,

146
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,100
 and we think, "Wow, if only we had what they had,

147
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,100
 we would be content."

148
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
 But the preacher is saying here,

149
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
 God gives this person wealth, possessions, and honor

150
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,100
 so that he lacks nothing at all that he desires.

151
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,100
 Yet God does not give him power to enjoy them.

152
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,100
 But a stranger enjoys them.

153
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,100
 This is vanity. It is a grievous sin.

154
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,100
 Has anybody been to Mississauga before?

155
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,100
 It's in Toronto. Yeah? Mississauga?

156
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
 There's this road. It's called Mississauga Road.

157
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,100
 All right? It's where all the most beautiful, big houses are.

158
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
 It's like sort of Beverly Hills, you know?

159
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,100
 Like all the huge houses. Right?

160
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
 And whenever I drive past there, I see this one house,

161
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,100
 and it just stands out.

162
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,100
 And I see this house, and I'm like, "Wow.

163
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
 If only I lived in this house."

164
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,100
 You know? Then, wow, my dreams would be fulfilled.

165
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,100
 And it's interesting, because my parents got to know this person.

166
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,100
 Somehow, he came to the church one day.

167
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,100
 Chinese, yes. It was important to you, right, Charles?

168
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,100
 He's Chinese. He was Chinese.

169
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:00,100
 And he came to our church, and one day, he was on the news.

170
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,100
 And he was back in Hong Kong. He was driving a Ferrari.

171
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,100
 And he was with his brother, and he crashed the car.

172
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
 And he died instantly.

173
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,100
 And I was like, "Wow. This person.

174
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
 He owned the house that I always dreamed of.

175
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,100
 He drove the car that I've always wanted."

176
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,100
 And unfortunately, God took him away.

177
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
 Wow.

178
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
 Wealth, possessions, honor.

179
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,100
 But it doesn't guarantee contentment.

180
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,100
 It doesn't guarantee contentment.

181
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,100
 This man left several kids and a wife behind.

182
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:52,100
 It's sad. It's sad to think that the wealth of this world doesn't mean contentment.

183
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,100
 Or yet, you're able to enjoy them.

184
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
 Second "would you rather" question.

185
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
 All right.

186
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,100
 Would you rather have a hundred children?

187
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,100
 Does anybody have a hundred children here?

188
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:16,100
 A hundred children while your soul is not satisfied and no one goes to your funeral?

189
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,100
 Okay. Would you rather have a hundred children and your soul is not satisfied and no one goes to your funeral?

190
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:29,100
 Or would you have no children while your soul is satisfied and some people attend your funeral?

191
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,100
 Okay. Who would rather have situation A? Raise your hand.

192
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,100
 Situation A. A hundred children.

193
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,100
 Come on.

194
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,100
 So many children. Wow.

195
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,100
 A hundred children. Nobody? Going once. Going twice. I'm joking. It's not a...

196
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
 Okay. Who would have situation B? Raise your hand.

197
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
 Okay. All right. Very good.

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,100
 The second situation that the preacher talks about is this.

199
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:12,100
 A hundred children and lives many years but yet his soul is not satisfied and no one goes to his burial.

200
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,100
 What does it mean back in the day when you had a lot of children?

201
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
 Well, a lot of them, what did they do back then in Israel?

202
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
 They were farmers or taking care of the livestock. Right?

203
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,100
 So, if you had many children, it means you could have many helpers. Right?

204
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,100
 You wanted people to help, you know, with the business, with the farm, with the livestock.

205
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,100
 It meant that you probably could be richer. Right?

206
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:44,100
 If you took care of the livestock better or you took care of the farm better, it meant you could have been richer.

207
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,100
 Also, it meant you had descendants. Right?

208
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,100
 Descendants was very important to have a name that could carry on. Right?

209
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,100
 David and his lineage. Right?

210
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,100
 God promised that your lineage would pass on. That was a very important thing.

211
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:09,100
 Also, if you had many children, it could have meant that you would have been taken care of. Right?

212
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
 My dad always asks me. Right?

213
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
 Oh, he didn't always ask me. He just asked me before.

214
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,100
 He's like, "When you get older, will you take care of me?"

215
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,100
 Has anybody's parents ever asked them this? Yeah?

216
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,100
 Oh, yeah. Somebody. I'm not the only person.

217
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
 So, I like to play with my dad. Right?

218
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,100
 So, I'm like, "Let me think about it."

219
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
 You know, I was 10 at the time.

220
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,100
 Actually, what I said is, "I'll only take care of mom."

221
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
 Just to bug him. Just to bug him.

222
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
 I'm joking, dad. I'm joking.

223
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,100
 I'll take care of you.

224
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
 And it's sad. Right?

225
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,100
 It's sad that when, you know, some of these old people.

226
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,100
 We went to do elderly visitation.

227
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
 All right?

228
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
 This is before COVID.

229
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:12,100
 We went regularly as a fellowship to visit some of the elderlies in our city.

230
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,100
 And we visited some of them, and they were doing great.

231
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:22,100
 You know, their sons or their daughter and their relatives or their grandchildren would come and visit regularly.

232
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,100
 There would also be some that we encountered that were very lonely.

233
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
 And I remember this vividly.

234
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,100
 This one elderly gentleman who lived by himself.

235
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,100
 And I asked him where his kids were.

236
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
 Did he have any family? Any kids?

237
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,100
 And he's like, "Yes. I have kids. I have two children.

238
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
 And they live in Australia."

239
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,100
 I'm like, "Oh, that's great. You have children in Australia."

240
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,100
 And I'm like, "When's the last time you've seen them?"

241
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,100
 And he said, "I don't remember. It must have been several years already."

242
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
 And I was like, "Oh, it must be very busy.

243
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,100
 Maybe they just, you know, have work and children and they don't have time.

244
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
 Maybe they call you. Have they called you?"

245
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,100
 And he's like, "No. He doesn't really call often either."

246
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:18,100
 It's sad to have children, 100 children, and no one attends your burial.

247
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,100
 And nobody takes care of you when you get older.

248
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,100
 And the preacher says in this situation, it's better to have a stillborn baby,

249
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:38,100
 a stillborn baby, than to be one of these people.

250
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
 It's because he says this, right?

251
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,100
 "For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness.

252
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,100
 And in darkness, the name is covered.

253
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,100
 Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything.

254
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,100
 Yet it finds rest rather than he."

255
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:02,100
 Better a stillborn child than a person who has 100 children

256
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
 and nobody attends his funeral.

257
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
 So, children doesn't guarantee contentment.

258
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,100
 Children doesn't guarantee contentment.

259
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,100
 The last thing, the last point he mentions,

260
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
 okay, let's do the next "Would you rather" game.

261
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,100
 Would you rather live 2,000 years, okay, 2,000 years,

262
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
 that's a very long time, okay?

263
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,100
 Think of all the investments you could make in 2,000 years.

264
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:44,100
 And enjoy no good, or you live a short life and enjoy some good, okay?

265
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,100
 Who would rather have situation A, raise their hand, live 2,000 years?

266
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
 Anybody want to live 2,000 years?

267
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
 2,000 years? No? Okay.

268
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,100
 Who would rather have situation B, raise their hand.

269
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:04,100
 Situation B, okay, all right, situation B.

270
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,100
 This is the last point he's trying to make.

271
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,100
 Even though he should live 1,000 years twice, over,

272
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,100
 yet enjoy no good, do not all go to the same place.

273
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:25,100
 Does anybody know who the oldest living person is right now?

274
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
 According to Wikipedia.

275
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,100
 I just Googled this a couple of days ago.

276
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,100
 150, okay, it's not. Let's show the next slide.

277
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,100
 The oldest living woman currently, according to Wikipedia in the green here,

278
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,100
 is 118 years old.

279
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,100
 118 years old, okay? Wow, that's great.

280
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:57,100
 Okay, Lucie, is it Lucie? Lucille, Lucille from France.

281
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:03,100
 Do you think the oldest person in the world is a living woman or a man right now?

282
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
 Do you think? Any guesses?

283
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
 Woman, okay.

284
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
 Next slide, you guys are right, you guys are smart.

285
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,100
 The oldest living man right now is 113 years old.

286
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,100
 It's Juan, right? Juan, okay, from Venezuela.

287
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:26,100
 Wow, who wants to live to 118 years old?

288
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 Raise their hand. Anybody want to? No? Why not?

289
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,100
 John does, okay, okay, JP, good.

290
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,100
 All right, you guys don't want to live that old, all right, understandable.

291
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:45,100
 Who is the oldest person in the Bible, oldest living person in the Bible?

292
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,100
 Not Abraham. Who?

293
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
 Starts with an M.

294
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
 Yes, I heard it, I heard it. Say it out loud.

295
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,100
 Yes, not Adam. Methuselah, Methuselah.

296
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,100
 How old was he? 969 years old.

297
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:11,100
 969 years old, wow, amazing.

298
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
 The preacher is saying this.

299
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
 What's so good about living so long?

300
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:23,100
 1,000 years, twice over, 2,000 years, what's so good about it?

301
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,100
 What's so good about it when, as we see in the next slide,

302
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:34,100
 both old and young people go to the same place?

303
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,100
 They all go to the same place, right?

304
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,100
 They eventually face death.

305
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:50,100
 And what he's saying is long life doesn't guarantee contentment.

306
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
 In chapter 6, he says this, right?

307
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,100
 Wealth, possessions, honor doesn't guarantee contentment.

308
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,100
 Children doesn't guarantee contentment.

309
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,100
 Living a long life doesn't guarantee contentment.

310
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
 It doesn't guarantee contentment.

311
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,100
 Let's continue in verse 7 to 9, verse 7 to 9 here.

312
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,100
 And he says this, "All the toil of man is for his mouth,

313
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100
 yet his appetite is not satisfied.

314
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,100
 For what advantage has the wise over the fool,

315
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:32,100
 and what does the poor know how to conduct himself over before the living?"

316
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,100
 The preacher is summarizing the problem in these couple of verses.

317
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
 He's saying that we are just never satisfied.

318
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,100
 We keep eating this appetite, right?

319
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,100
 The burger just gets longer and taller and bigger, right?

320
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,100
 But we're just never satisfied, right?

321
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,100
 How good would it be to pay for somebody's meal

322
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,100
 and know that they would be satisfied for the rest of their life, right?

323
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,100
 I keep eating buffets and just keep never getting satisfied.

324
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,100
 I keep eating and eating, eating and eating.

325
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,100
 We have this desire within us and it just never gets satisfied, right?

326
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
 Have you ever thought about that?

327
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,100
 You might be thinking about your next meal.

328
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,100
 But have you thought about the next meal after that

329
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
 and the meal after that and the meal after that?

330
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
 Because it keeps going.

331
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,100
 We're never satisfied.

332
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,100
 And that's what the preacher is saying,

333
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,100
 that all the work that we have is for our mouth,

334
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,100
 and yet we are never satisfied.

335
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,100
 This is the problem.

336
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
 And he says this problem is all over, right?

337
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
 You could be wise.

338
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
 You could be a fool, right?

339
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
 You could be rich.

340
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
 You could be poor.

341
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
 Both of these two kinds of people,

342
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,100
 they all have this unquenchable satisfaction,

343
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,100
 unquenchable desire that cannot be satisfied.

344
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
 We're just not satisfied.

345
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,100
 The ultimate problem is this desire that we have

346
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,100
 that just never seems to be satisfied.

347
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,100
 And so the preacher highlights the problem.

348
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
 He specifies three specific situations

349
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 that we can't find contentment or satisfaction.

350
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
 And then he finishes off this chapter.

351
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
 And he says this.

352
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
 Let's read it together, all right?

353
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,100
 "Whatever has come to be has already been named,

354
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
 and it has known what man is,

355
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,100
 and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he.

356
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
 The one"--words--

357
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
 "the more vanity.

358
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,100
 And what is advantage to man?

359
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,100
 For who knows what is good for man while he lives

360
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
 the few days of his vain life,

361
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,100
 which he passes like a shadow?

362
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,100
 For who can tell man what will come after him under the sun?

363
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,100
 The first thing that he talks about is

364
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:25,100
 whatever has come to be has already been named."

365
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:33,100
 The first thing that the preacher is specifying here

366
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,100
 is that there's somebody that already knows what's going to happen.

367
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,100
 He calls us to contentment.

368
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
 And the first thing he mentions to us

369
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,100
 is that God is in control.

370
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
 He is sovereign.

371
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,100
 He already knows what is going to be named.

372
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,100
 Before Google had a name,

373
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
 before Microsoft had a name,

374
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
 before Apple had a name,

375
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,100
 God already knew these things were going to be named.

376
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
 He is in control.

377
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
 He's all-knowing.

378
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,100
 He is sovereign.

379
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,100
 The second thing he points out is that God is stronger, right?

380
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
 It is known what man is

381
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,100
 and that he is not able to dispute with one that is stronger than he.

382
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,100
 In other words, God is wiser.

383
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,100
 God is stronger and wiser than us.

384
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:34,100
 The third thing that the preacher points out is this, right?

385
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,100
 "For who knows what is good for man while he lives

386
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
 the few days of his life?"

387
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,100
 The third thing that the preacher points out is this,

388
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,100
 that God knows what is best for us.

389
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,100
 God knows what is best for us.

390
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,100
 And so he is calling us to contentment.

391
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
 And so according to these verses,

392
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,100
 what is truly contentment?

393
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
 I'll give the definition here.

394
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,100
 Contentment is confidence that God is sovereign over all things,

395
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,100
 that he is much wiser than us,

396
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,100
 and believing that he has what is best for us.

397
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,100
 Contentment is confidence that God is sovereign over all things,

398
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,100
 that he is much wiser than us,

399
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:37,100
 and trusting that he has what is best for us.

400
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
 Apostle Paul says this,

401
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,100
 "Not that I am speaking of being in need,

402
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:48,100
 for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.

403
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:56,100
 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to be abound."

404
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,100
 And that's 'cause Paul was rich.

405
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,100
 Before he was rich, right, he was one of the Pharisees.

406
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
 He went to the top schools.

407
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,100
 He knows what it means to have a high position.

408
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,100
 But he was also a fool, because he did not know God.

409
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,100
 He didn't know truly Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

410
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
 And he was also poor, right?

411
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:33,100
 And he was also funded by the churches as a tent maker in his ministry.

412
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,100
 And so Paul has been rich.

413
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
 He has been poor.

414
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
 He has been wise.

415
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
 He has been a fool.

416
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,100
 And yet he's saying here in this situation,

417
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:50,100
 he has learned to be content in whatever situation.

418
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,100
 And he's talking to the Philippian church here.

419
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,100
 He's talking about, you know, the suffering he's enduring for the gospel.

420
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
 He's talking about the churches he's built up,

421
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,100
 the opposition that he's faced.

422
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:14,100
 And yet, God strengthens him through all things.

423
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
 Pascal says this,

424
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,100
 "There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every person,

425
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,100
 and it can never be filled by any created thing.

426
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:34,100
 It can only be filled by God, made known through Jesus Christ."

427
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
 Put your hand on your heart right now.

428
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,100
 Put your hand on your heart.

429
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
 Know this, right?

430
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,100
 This is what Pascal is saying.

431
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:54,100
 Your heart cannot be filled by LV or Gucci or Ferrari or another condo.

432
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:02,100
 It can only be filled by the Creator himself.

433
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,100
 Not any created thing, only the Creator himself,

434
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,100
 made known through Jesus Christ.

435
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,100
 So you ask, you know, Pastor John, Johnny, or John as well,

436
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
 you can ask Pastor John,

437
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,100
 "Is life a dead end? Is life a dead end street?"

438
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,100
 The preacher is challenging us here today

439
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:34,100
 that life ends, or life actually begins.

440
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:44,100
 Life begins when we die to our own desires, our selfish desires.

441
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:50,100
 Life begins when we die to our own desires.

442
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,100
 What did Jesus say?

443
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:03,100
 If we are to follow him, we must deny ourselves.

444
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,100
 Pick up the cross and follow him.

445
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
 And what is eternal life?

446
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,100
 Eternal life is knowing Jesus Christ.

447
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,100
 Life truly begins when we die to ourselves,

448
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:24,100
 when we deny ourselves our own selfishness, our own sin.

449
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,100
 Life truly begins.

450
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,100
 Life truly begins.

451
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
 The preacher is challenging us

452
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,100
 that we can't find contentment in this world.

453
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
 Many children, wealth, long years of life,

454
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,100
 we can't find contentment in this world.

455
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
 It's only through the Creator that can satisfy

456
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,100
 this deep longings in our heart.

457
00:28:51,100 --> 00:29:00,100
 Only the Creator can satisfy the deepest longings of our heart.

458
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,100
 And that is why it's so hard to be a Christian in this world.

459
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
 Why is it so hard?

460
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,100
 Because we're living in this world,

461
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:16,100
 full of its temptations, its different desires,

462
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,100
 people you can compare with.

463
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
 We're supposed to be living in this world,

464
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,100
 and we're so trapped with the temptations and the sins of this world,

465
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,100
 but we're not supposed to be of this world.

466
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,100
 Our destination is heaven.

467
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,100
 Our destination is heaven.

468
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,100
 We're supposed to live among these people,

469
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,100
 climbing the corporate ladder,

470
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,100
 making money, just like the people around us,

471
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,100
 exercising, having fun,

472
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
 but we're not of this world.

473
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,100
 Money, how good we are at sports,

474
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,100
 is not supposed to define us.

475
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,100
 Our identity is in heaven.

476
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
 Our passport is in heaven.

477
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
 It's not about a passport in Hong Kong,

478
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,100
 or if you get it in UK, or if you get it in Canada.

479
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:21,100
 Our citizenship has to be from heaven.

480
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,100
 And so you ask Pastor Johnny,

481
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,100
 "I want to be content.

482
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
 How can I do it?"

483
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,100
 Practically, every day, in this world, day to day,

484
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
 how can I do it?

485
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
 I have three points for you.

486
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
 Three points.

487
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,100
 And the first thing is what the preacher talked about.

488
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
 Give up control.

489
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
 Give up control.

490
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
 Right?

491
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
 We need to trust that God is sovereign,

492
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
 that He is in control.

493
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
 He's wiser than us,

494
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,100
 and that He has what is best for us.

495
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,100
 The first thing is we have to give up control.

496
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
 Right?

497
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,100
 There are many things in this world that we can't control.

498
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,100
 The only thing that we can control is what we do,

499
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,100
 our attitude, and what we do, and our actions.

500
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
 Right?

501
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,100
 So the first thing that we need to do is give up control.

502
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,100
 Give up control, not to just to anyone, but to who?

503
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,100
 To the one that is sovereign, wiser,

504
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,100
 and knows what is best for us.

505
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,100
 Jeremiah 29, 11, Pastor John prayed it.

506
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,100
 "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord.

507
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,100
 "Plans to prosper you and not to harm you.

508
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,100
 Plans to give you hope and a future."

509
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:47,100
 God was saying this to the Israel people.

510
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
 They were in suffering, in exile,

511
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
 for more than 300 years, right?

512
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
 Or 300 years.

513
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
 Do I still have a future?

514
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,100
 Will I still prosper?

515
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
 God was giving them.

516
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,100
 God was giving them this promise.

517
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,100
 And He is also speaking to us today.

518
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,100
 God wants us to have a future and a hope.

519
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,100
 It might not be, you know, being super rich.

520
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,100
 It might not be everything that you wish you could have.

521
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,100
 But God will give you enough.

522
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,100
 He is enough.

523
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
 Give up control.

524
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,100
 Give control to the Lord.

525
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
 What do you think the second thing is?

526
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
 Don't show it yet.

527
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
 What do you think the--

528
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
 Give what?

529
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
 What's the second thing?

530
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
 Any ideas?

531
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
 Give?

532
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
 Give thanks.

533
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
 We got to give thanks.

534
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
 1 Thessalonians, it says this,

535
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,100
 "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing,

536
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,100
 give thanks in all circumstances.

537
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:03,100
 For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

538
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
 Give thanks.

539
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,100
 I remember a couple times in my life,

540
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
 I was very unhappy.

541
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
 I don't know what happened.

542
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
 I was--

543
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
 I don't know, somebody--

544
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,100
 Maybe I lost in a basketball game or something.

545
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
 It doesn't happen often, but it might have happened.

546
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,100
 And I just remember, you know, I feel so frustrated.

547
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
 I missed that shot.

548
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,100
 You know, I didn't guard this person right, you know, in defense.

549
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
 I was just so frustrated.

550
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
 I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to play basketball again

551
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,100
 for another week," or something like that.

552
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:39,100
 And I just remember, like, remind myself, give thanks.

553
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
 Have you ever tried giving thanks

554
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,100
 when you're in a very unhappy situation?

555
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
 What happens?

556
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,100
 Has anybody tried giving thanks when they're not happy, sad?

557
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
 Has anybody tried it?

558
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
 Yes?

559
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
 What happens when you do it?

560
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
 You feel better.

561
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
 You're at peace.

562
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,100
 Very good.

563
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
 You guys should try it.

564
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,100
 The next time you're unhappy, or maybe you're unhappy now,

565
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
 you should try it.

566
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
 Give thanks.

567
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
 "Oh, God, thank you.

568
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,100
 You know, I still have breath.

569
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,100
 Thank you, God.

570
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
 You know, I still have my children, my family.

571
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
 I have people who love me.

572
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,100
 I have this church, and I have all these pastors

573
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
 that take care of me."

574
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,100
 You know, start to give thanks.

575
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,100
 And when you give thanks, you start to be content,

576
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,100
 thankful for the things God has given you.

577
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,100
 The last give is give away.

578
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,100
 Give control to God, give thanks to God,

579
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:44,100
 and you give away to God and to others.

580
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:50,100
 God spoke to Abraham, or Abram back then, and he said this.

581
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
 Next slide.

582
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
 "I will make you into a great nation.

583
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
 I will bless you.

584
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:03,100
 I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing."

585
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,100
 Why did God want to bless Abraham?

586
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,100
 Why did God want to bless Israel?

587
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,100
 So that they could be a blessing to others.

588
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
 God didn't want to bless Abraham so he could be super rich,

589
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,100
 take control of the whole world, and that would be that.

590
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,100
 He wanted to bless Abraham and Israel so that they could be

591
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,100
 a blessing to others.

592
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,100
 A blessing to others.

593
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,100
 Now I know the Israel team has been to the next slide,

594
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
 the Dead Sea.

595
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,100
 Why is the Dead Sea called the Dead Sea?

596
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
 What has happened?

597
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
 What has happened?

598
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
 Pastor John, what has happened?

599
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,100
 Water, salt water keeps coming in, right?

600
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
 But then what happens?

601
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,100
 It just stays there.

602
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:05,100
 Eventually the sun evaporates it and it becomes very, very salty.

603
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,100
 The water evaporates and it becomes very salty.

604
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
 It doesn't flow.

605
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,100
 It doesn't flow.

606
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:22,100
 And that's what happens when we keep God's blessing for ourselves.

607
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:29,100
 That's what happens when we keep God's blessing for ourselves.

608
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,100
 Eventually we become like the Dead Sea.

609
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,100
 We get stuffed up.

610
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
 We spend everything.

611
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
 It all becomes about us.

612
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,100
 When we keep God's blessing, when God has blessed you with

613
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,100
 knowledge, God has blessed you with money, God has blessed you

614
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:56,100
 with resources or connections, when you keep it to yourself,

615
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,100
 eventually it just all becomes about you.

616
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:06,100
 And when it becomes all about you, eventually you fall into sin.

617
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,100
 You fall into the Dead Sea, literally.

618
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,100
 God blesses you with money.

619
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,100
 God blesses you with connections.

620
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
 God blesses you with musical talent.

621
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:30,100
 God blesses you with connections so that you can bless others.

622
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,100
 So that you can be a blessing to those around you.

623
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
 That's right.

624
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:44,100
 God is calling us to contentment in a very discontented world.

625
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:52,100
 The preacher is calling us to be content in this very discontent world.

626
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:58,100
 Are you willing to give control to the Lord?

627
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
 Acknowledge that He is in control.

628
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
 He is sovereign.

629
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,100
 He is wiser than you.

630
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:10,100
 And that He has what is best for you.

631
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,100
 Some of the most unhappy people are people that think they need to

632
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,100
 control everything.

633
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,100
 Are we willing to give up that control for surrender to the Lord?

634
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,100
 Are you willing to give thanks?

635
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,100
 Paul told the church, give thanks continuously.

636
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,100
 Every day we need to pray and give thanks to the Lord for what He has

637
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,100
 given us.

638
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,100
 If you give up control to the Lord, if you give thanks to the Lord,

639
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,100
 and you give away to the Lord and give away to the people that God wants

640
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
 you to give it away to.

641
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,100
 The things, the possessions, the knowledge, the connections, the

642
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
 things that God has blessed you with.

643
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,100
 If you give it away.

644
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,100
 God has called us not to be hoarders.

645
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,100
 God has called us to be stewards.

646
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,100
 Stewards don't own anything.

647
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
 Stewards are only caretakers.

648
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,100
 We only take care of the money that God has given us.

649
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,100
 We only take care of the children that God has given us.

650
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,100
 We are not hoarders.

651
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,100
 God has called us to be stewards.

652
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,100
 Are you in control?

653
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
 Are you going to take control?

654
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
 Or are you going to surrender?

655
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
 Are you going to give thanks?

656
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,100
 Or are you going to complain?

657
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
 Are you going to give away?

658
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,100
 Or are you going to hoard it for yourself?

659
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:53,100
 That is what the preacher is challenging us today.

660
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:58,100
 As the band comes up and we are going to sing the song,

661
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:05,100
 God, I look to you.

662
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
 Goodness of God.

663
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,100
 Let's take a moment right now to reflect on our heart and come

664
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
 before the Lord.

665
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,100
 And even in repentance.

666
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,100
 God, have I surrendered control to you?

667
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:30,100
 Or am I full of myself and I want to control things?

668
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,100
 God, am I thankful?

669
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,100
 Or am I complaining?

670
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:43,100
 God, am I giving away?

671
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,100
 Or am I hoarding for myself?

672
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:53,100
 Let's reflect on ourselves and our heart.

673
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,100
 And just confess these things before the Lord.

674
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
 Let's take a moment.

675
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
