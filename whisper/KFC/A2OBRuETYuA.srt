1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 All right, thank you everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 And there is the dream team.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 We might be the daydream team.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Hopefully we don't get dunked on by these tribal university students.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We don't know what level of basketball they are, but we will see.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 We will clearly see.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Speaking of seeing, I'm going to do a little bit of an eye test.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Has anybody done magic before?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Magic eye test, these pictures?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Let's see it.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 All right, who can see?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 So usually the trick is you have to cross your eyes.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Like, a little bit of a blind eye.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 All right, anybody see it?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Anybody see it?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Is the guitar in the way?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Let me move the guitar.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 What do you guys see?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Come on.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Words?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 What words?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Are you seeing?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Chinese words?

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I don't think there's Chinese words in this.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I hear a telephone.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 What do you guys see?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Nobody can see?

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Come on.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Can't see?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Somebody said it.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Somebody said it.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 It's a spiral.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Did you see a spiral?

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You can't see the spiral?

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Okay, all right, it's okay.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 We will teach you to see.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Okay, let's try the next one.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Let's try the next one.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Okay, maybe if you stand, you'll be able to see better.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 You're going to try standing.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Try standing.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Maybe it's more eye level and you'll be able to see.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Let's all stand.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Let's all stand.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Okay.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Not better?

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Can anybody see?

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Do you see anything?

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 What do you see?

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Nothing.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Okay.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Okay, Vincent's good at this.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Vincent, you should be able to see this.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 You can't do it this way.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Why not?

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Let me see.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It doesn't work?

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Can you guys see it?

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 It doesn't work?

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Oh, I see it.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I see it.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 No, it does work.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I see it.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Come on, guys.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I see it.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 No, literally, I do see it.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Nobody sees it?

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It's not a bunch of fives.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Gabe, what is it?

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It is the cross.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 There is a cross here in the middle.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Okay?

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 All right, maybe everybody -- Vincent, you don't need to be that close.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 No, I saw it from where Kelly was.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Okay, everybody sit down.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I think it's blocking.

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Okay, let's try it.

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Let's try again.

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Next one.

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Next one.

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Let's try again.

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Okay, sit down.

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Pastor John, you're blocking everybody.

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 You're preventing people from seeing.

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Okay, so squint your eyes a little bit.

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Cross eye a little bit.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And you'll be able to see it.

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Okay, is it better without the lights?

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Okay, some people are looking at the screen in the back.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Okay, I will join you.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Gordon, you're the eye doctor.

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Come on.

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Can you see it?

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Okay, you guys should see it.

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I see it now.

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I see it now.

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I see it now.

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Anybody see it yet?

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Anybody see it yet?

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Who's seen it?

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Okay, I'll send this out later so you can play with it all night.

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 This is your application for the sermon.

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 But you should be able to see something like this to there.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 It's supposed to be a heart.

105
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 It's supposed to be the heart.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 All right, we'll skip the next one since you guys are having such a difficult time.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But this is called magic eye.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Usually squint your eyes a little bit.

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 You maybe cross your eye a little bit.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 You move your eye a little different perspective.

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 All right?

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And -- okay, Uncle Vincent is teaching a group in the back.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It looks like a group of tourists coming from different land to see different things.

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 [ Laughter ]

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Uncle Vincent, did you see it?

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Okay, let me see if I can see it in the back.

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Let me see if I can see it in the back.

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 No, no, you don't need to drink to see this.

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 [ Laughter ]

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Okay.

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You want to do the next one?

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Okay, do the previous one.

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 All right.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Okay, this is the challenge.

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 See if you guys can see it.

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Okay, you guys see the cross?

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You see it now?

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Wow, you guys are all winners.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 At the cross, yes, literally there is a cross in the middle.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Who sees it?

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Raise your hand.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Who's seen it?

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Okay, we see 5% of the people maybe.

134
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 There's like five hands up.

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Good for you.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Excellent.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 All right.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 It's okay.

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 All right, we don't have time, guys, to look at you trying to see this all night.

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So it takes some skill.

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I didn't know how to do this at first either, but there is some tricks.

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 You can look on the Internet or ask Uncle Vincent afterwards.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 But the reason I'm doing this is because we're talking about a person who is blind and he couldn't see.

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But after an encounter with Jesus, he was able to see.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Let's read Mark chapter 8 together.

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Let's read Mark chapter 8 together.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Let's read it.

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 One, two, three.

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 "They came and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Then he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him.

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Jesus asked, 'Do you see anything?'"

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Let's continue.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 "He looked up and said, 'I see people.

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 They look like trees walking around.'

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eye.

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Then his eyes were opened.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 His sight was restored and he saw everything clearly.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Jesus sent him home, saying, 'Don't even go into the village.'"

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Alright.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So, we're looking at this passage.

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And where is Jesus?

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Beth. Bethsaida.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Okay. Do you guys know what Beth means in Hebrew?

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I don't know. Anybody know?

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Okay. So, it means "house of a fisher."

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Okay. Beth is, I think, it's "house."

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So, it's a small fishing village.

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 So, if anybody's been to the Sea of Galilee,

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Bethsaida is on the north side of the Sea of Galilee.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Okay. And what is it known for?

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Well, Jesus actually talks about Bethsaida specifically afterwards.

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 In Matthew chapter 11, "Woe to you, Chorazin!

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Woe to you, Bethsaida!

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 For if the miracles that were performed in you

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 had been performed in Tir and Sidon,

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 they would have repented long ago in Saccoth and Ashes."

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 So, there were possibly many miracles that happened.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And this was another miracle that happened in Bethsaida,

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 although it's a bit outside of the town.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 So, this was known as Philip's hometown.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Philip was one of the disciples of Jesus,

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 and it is apparent that he might have grown up here.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 All right. What's interesting about this story

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 is that this blind man didn't go to Jesus himself.

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Okay. There's previous blind people that were healed.

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 One was like, "Jesus of Nazareth! Jesus of Nazareth! Where are you?"

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Right? And Jesus walking along the road,

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 and Jesus heard him.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Out of all the people in the crowd, he heard him,

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 and he went to heal this man.

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 But this blind man, he did not...

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It seems as if he did not go to Jesus himself.

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 All right. He was brought by a bunch of friends.

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And these friends pleaded with Jesus to heal him.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Right? What was the word that was used?

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 They came, and people brought a blind man

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 and begged Jesus to touch him.

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Begged. These people begged on behalf of this blind man

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 that he would be healed.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Pleading with Jesus. Pleading with Jesus.

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And that's the first thing that we see here.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 That this man had amazing friends.

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Amazing friends. Okay?

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And a lot of times, if we are able to admit to ourselves,

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 we have our own blind spots.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 We have our own blind spots.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 There are things that we can't see.

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 A lot of times when I get into a conflict, right,

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 whether it could be at church, at home, or, you know, outside friends,

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 I usually check with another person. Right?

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Because maybe I'm too emotionally caught up in this,

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and I'm just like, my perspective is not right.

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I usually, sometimes I play the trick like,

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 oh, if I could counsel myself,

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 has anybody tried this before? Self-counseling.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So imagine you are counseling with yourself,

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 and you're trying to be not emotional,

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 and you're trying to give yourself advice.

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 What advice would you give? Right?

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Or, oh, maybe you're too emotional, or you're attached,

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 you can't see certain things. All right?

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 We have certain blind spots.

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 This man was literally blind, and he had special friends.

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Do you have special friends that help you when you cannot see?

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Who thinks they have really special friends

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 that point out to them things that they cannot see?

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Sandra, do you point out things to John?

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Agnes, do you point out things to Vincent?

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 All the time.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 In the story of the Bible, one story particularly comes out.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 David, who was his best friend?

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Jonathan. Jonathan was his best friend.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Who was chasing after him?

235
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Saul, who is Jonathan's dad.

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Weird relationship, right? Really weird relationship.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 So his dad wants to kill David,

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 because he's supposed to be the next king,

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 and Saul is like, really want to hold on to his power.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And Jonathan is David's best friend.

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And so, a lot of times, David wanted to give up.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 He wanted to give up. I should just give myself up.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And Jonathan was like, no, you can't give up.

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 God has sworn to you that you will be the next king.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And I, your friend, am standing beside you,

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 even though it's against my father.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 You know, that's a tough situation for Jonathan.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Who wants to be the best friend of a person

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 that your dad wants to kill?

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Anybody want to be in this situation?

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It's a tough situation.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Hollywood couldn't come up with a better story.

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They copied the story, probably.

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Jonathan was that best friend.

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Many times, David was hiding in a cave.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 The Israel team, did you guys go into some caves in Israel?

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Yeah? Was it fun living in those caves?

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Would you stay overnight?

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 You know, you'd have to eat there, do your stuff there.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Right?

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Saul did something there. He had to go.

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Was it fun? No.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Saul was chasing him for so many days.

264
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 David wanted to give up also,

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 but his friends held on to him,

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 told him to not give up.

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Imagine an army chasing after you.

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 You know, who's been chased before?

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Anybody want to be on the run?

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Yeah?

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Don't put your hands up, it's okay.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Who wants to be chased constantly?

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Right? Like the movie, The Fugitive.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 That's the movie.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Uncle Vincent's time.

276
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Harrison Ford.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Always getting chased by the FBI.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Hiding from house to house.

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Having to change identities.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Nobody wants to have that.

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 But who held David up?

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It was his friends.

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 David held up his friends.

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And this blind man?

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I don't know how long he's been blind for,

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 but he has some amazing friends.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And these friends went out of the way

288
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 to take him to Jesus.

289
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And they begged.

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 The NIV word here is begged.

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Have you guys begged for anything in your life?

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Anybody begged for anything?

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Right?

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Maybe your husband is in the hospital.

295
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 You're begging.

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Begging the doctors to do the best that they can.

297
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I remember in my town in Mississauga,

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 we had a church,

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 and one of the church members,

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 his son, who was a university student,

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 suddenly caught cancer.

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Suddenly caught cancer.

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And I don't remember what kind of cancer it was.

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I think it was a tumor in his brain.

305
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And my parents visited his mom,

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 who didn't go to church at that time.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Only his father went to the church.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And as soon as my parents went to their house,

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 the mother was on the floor,

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 begging my parents,

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 "Please help my son.

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 "Please heal him if you can.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 "Do something. Help."

314
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Begging.

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And my parents were like,

316
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 "We will pray and beg the Lord on your behalf

317
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 "that his son would be healed."

318
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And the son went to the Lord.

319
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 He believed in Jesus.

320
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 A couple weeks later, and a couple months later,

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 he went to the Lord.

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And so this mom begged on the ground

323
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 towards my parents, who were the pastors,

324
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 for their son.

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Could you imagine Jesus in Hong Kong?

326
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 There's going to be some people

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 wanting to get close to him.

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And we have somebody sick.

329
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And we are going to do our best.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Me, Kelly, Julian, JP,

331
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 we're going to do our best to bring our friend physically.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Imagine we don't have a car.

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Imagine we don't--

334
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Maybe we have a cart with some wooden wheels.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Is that what we would do?

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And we would bring him physically to Jesus

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 in this heat or rain.

338
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It would take work.

339
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And then when we get to Jesus,

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 we are begging Jesus.

341
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 We're rushing through the crowd,

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 and we are begging Jesus on behalf of our friend

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 that we probably grew up with,

344
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 that we know well,

345
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 that Jesus would heal him.

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And so the first thing we see here are friends.

347
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Friends help us to see in our blind spots.

348
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And the thing is,

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Jesus takes him by the hand

350
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 to the outside of the town.

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Right?

352
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Why would Jesus do that?

353
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Take him outside of the town?

354
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 What are some possibilities?

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Maybe the crowd was getting in the way.

356
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Okay.

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Well, we also saw from that warning from Jesus

358
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 or woe, right?

359
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 If you had seen--

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 If you understood the miracles,

361
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 you should have repented.

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Right?

363
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 That was the warning from Jesus.

364
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Maybe the people inside were against Jesus,

365
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 unrepentant, unwilling to change.

366
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Or maybe Jesus wanted to deal with this man one-on-one,

367
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 mono and mono, in solitude.

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Isn't that sometimes what Jesus does with us?

369
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 That we're caught up in this Hong Kong rat race,

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 trying to get up the corporate ladder,

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 trying to get through school,

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 from DSE to university to find a job.

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 We're caught up in this tsunami of life.

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And Jesus wants to just take us by the hand

375
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 to be with us alone.

376
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Maybe you're in that situation

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 that Jesus wants to just talk to you one-on-one.

378
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Maybe you've been even doing good things,

379
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 serving at church for so many years,

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 leading Bible studies, leading people to Jesus,

381
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 but you've been caught up in works.

382
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And Jesus just wants to be with you one-on-one

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 and speak to you one-on-one.

384
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Are you in that situation now?

385
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 That God wants to take you out of your town,

386
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 into private, and speak to you one-on-one.

387
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And we look at this healing process.

388
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 So, why does Jesus heal in this way?

389
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 There's a two-step process we see.

390
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 So the first thing Jesus does is he spits,

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 two, two, right, into the man's eyes.

392
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Okay?

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Dr. Gordon, do you use this for your healing process?

394
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 [laughs]

395
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I've been to his clinic.

396
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 I don't think he did that.

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Before I was drugged, I'm joking.

398
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 So, it was a two-step process.

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Jesus spit in this man's eyes, okay?

400
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And then he put his hands on his eyes, okay?

401
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And then he asks a question.

402
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Do you see?

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Do you see?

404
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Dr. Gordon, do you do a two-step process for your healing?

405
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 [laughs]

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Sandra would know.

407
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 She's been in the clinic, okay, recently.

408
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Do you see?

409
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And this indicates the healing process has sort of begun.

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 What does the man say?

411
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Do you guys remember?

412
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 "Well, I sort of see."

413
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 What did he say?

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 "I see people that look like trees.

415
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I see trees of green."

416
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Is that the song?

417
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 [laughs]

418
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Maybe that's where he got it from, this song, huh?

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 "See trees of green," all right?

420
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And this man, what does this say about this man?

421
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 That he sees sort of people that look like trees.

422
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 It must mean that he wasn't specifically born blind.

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 He must have seen people before or trees before, right?

424
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 That's one possibility, that he wasn't born blind.

425
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Something must have happened.

426
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 We don't know what, all right?

427
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Because he's describing things that he sees.

428
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And then there is a second laying of hands upon the eyes,

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and then he is able to see it clearly.

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Complete healing, complete healing, complete healing.

431
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Now, is spitting part of Jesus' healing process?

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Have we seen this before?

433
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Actually, there are other parallel miracles that he does use spit, okay?

434
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 In John chapter 9, there's a man born blind.

435
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 He spits in some mud and puts the mud with saliva onto the eyes in John chapter 9

436
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 and tells him to clean his eyes, the mud from his eyes in the pool, okay?

437
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So Jesus has used spit before.

438
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 There's another man in Mark chapter 10, later verses, a blind man,

439
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 and Jesus does not use spit, okay?

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Jesus uses spoken word, "Be healed, see," right?

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And so it's interesting, however, that Jesus uses spitting on the eyes for this process.

442
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Now, some people say -- I'm going to skip a couple of slides, actually --

443
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 why does Jesus heal this man this way?

444
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 One possibility, maybe the blind man's eyes were really dirty,

445
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 and he needed some washing, right?

446
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Have you guys waken up before, and there's some stuff in your eyes, right?

447
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 You've got to -- oh, can't see clearly, right?

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Maybe there's some stuff in his eyes.

449
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 There's this quote from Howard, the commentary,

450
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 "To remove the dirt and dried secretions from the eyelids preparatory to the healing," okay?

451
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So that's one view.

452
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 The other view is could Jesus have miscalculated the miracle?

453
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Could Jesus have miscalculated, okay?

454
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Not enough laying of hands or not enough spit, right?

455
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Could Jesus have had a bad day?

456
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I had a bad day.

457
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Yeah?

458
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Attitude? Okay, Uncle Vincent will sing it for us later.

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Could Jesus have had an off day?

460
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 You know, we all have off days.

461
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Jesus is fully human and fully God.

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Could he have had a bad day?

463
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Well, that possibly is not the case because we see the healing is well on its way, right?

464
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 We see that Jesus is not lacking in power or is weak that day.

465
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Another possibility is could this man not have had enough faith?

466
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Or since Jesus was testing his faith, what do you see, right?

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 He wasn't willing, maybe he wasn't willing to open his eyes yet, right?

468
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And so Jesus wanted to test him to be like, "How great is your faith? What do you see?"

469
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Right?

470
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And so that could be a third possibility.

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 A third possibility.

472
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 But what is most likely here is that we believe Jesus can heal in many ways.

473
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 He can heal instantly.

474
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 He can heal through a process.

475
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Sometimes Jesus can say, "Your healing will take place in eternity."

476
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 That is sometimes God's will.

477
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 It could be now.

478
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 It could be later.

479
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It could be not till eternity.

480
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Has any of us begged the Lord to take away something or heal something in your life?

481
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Yeah?

482
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Has Jesus healed right away, immediately?

483
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 A lot of times he doesn't heal immediately.

484
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Sometimes it's a process of trusting him.

485
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 There's a process, two-step process, three-step, ten-step process.

486
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Sometimes healing takes time.

487
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And it is us needing to trust him in his perfect timing.

488
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 There is a person in our university group that recommended his friend to talk to me.

489
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 His friend was in Toronto, and he had just broken up with his girlfriend, or his girlfriend left him.

490
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Okay?

491
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 All right.

492
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Don't laugh, Charles.

493
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It might happen to you.

494
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 [laughter]

495
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 I'm sorry.

496
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I'm sorry for being mean.

497
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Forgive me.

498
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 So he was--because this girl had broken up with him, okay, he was going through a very hard time.

499
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And he was even contemplating suicide.

500
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Okay?

501
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And so for months and months I was talking to him.

502
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I was like, "No, you don't need to commit suicide."

503
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 He was trying to commit suicide so that his girlfriend would notice him and maybe take him back.

504
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 You know, this ongoing cycle, right, of hurting myself so people would notice.

505
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I was just trying to go through some counseling with him, talking through with him.

506
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 He was caught up in this box of this girlfriend being the idol in his life.

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And he lost this idol, and he lost--so he lost motivation, he lost purpose of his life because he lost his girlfriend.

508
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And he had so much regret and remorse.

509
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 It was, "Oh, I had so many things I could have done better so that maybe my girlfriend would have kept me."

510
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 You know, and they kept going to the same university, so there's times that they would bump into each other,

511
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 and that would cause more hurt because they keep seeing each other over and over again.

512
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And so it was such a long process of having to talk to this person and trying to help him to go to the Lord,

513
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 asking the Lord for healing for him, for his heart.

514
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And it seemed like an endless process, right, months after months.

515
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And then eventually I saw a breakthrough.

516
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 He started going to a certain church, and he found a certain community.

517
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And the most important thing is he found a new purpose.

518
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 A new purpose.

519
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 This girl had become such an important motivation, purpose in his life, that when it was gone, it was like heart surgery.

520
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And slowly he filled his heart once again with the right purpose, and that was God himself.

521
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And God slowly changed his mind, healed his heart, and he begun to seek after the Lord.

522
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Healing was a process.

523
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And I admit, there were times where I didn't know whether this friend would be healed.

524
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I didn't know.

525
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 It was a difficult process.

526
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 There were times where he would mess it and be like, "I don't know if I can go on any longer."

527
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It was a process.

528
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And sometimes God heals us in a process.

529
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Let's look at this healing even more.

530
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Let's look at the miracles in Mark to look at another reason why Jesus might have healed in a two-step process.

531
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Okay, cycle number one, miracles in Mark.

532
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Cycle number one, if you look at Mark chapter 6, Jesus feeds the 5,000.

533
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And then he has a debate with the Pharisees and scribes.

534
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Who are you to heal?

535
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Who are you to be feeding?

536
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Under what authority?

537
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 He has a debate.

538
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 And then there was a healing of a death man in Mark chapter 7 that followed.

539
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 So in verse 33, "After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his finger into the man's ear.

540
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Then he spit and touched the man's tongue."

541
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Now that's interesting, right?

542
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Once again, he uses spit.

543
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Okay, I'm not saying store up your spit for some spiritual miracle afterwards, okay?

544
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 That's not what I'm saying.

545
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I'm just saying these are the observations that I'm making.

546
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 So there is bread, the feeding.

547
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 There is a debate.

548
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And then there is a speech, right, a healing.

549
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 That's the first cycle.

550
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Let's compare the first cycle with the second cycle, okay?

551
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 So the second cycle, we also see, okay, actually it's the feeding of the 4,000.

552
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 4,000, Mark chapter 8, feeding of the 4,000.

553
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 And then there is also a debate with the Pharisees and scribes in Mark chapter 8, verses 10 and 12.

554
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Once again, there is a debate.

555
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And then next, there is also a healing.

556
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And this is the story we're looking at today, the healing of a blind man.

557
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Both instances, there is a feeding.

558
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Both instances, there is a debate.

559
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And in both instances, there is a healing.

560
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 One of a deaf man and one of a blind man.

561
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And interestingly, Jesus both uses spit in both healings.

562
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And so, what does it mean?

563
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 What could it mean that Jesus was using this two-step process?

564
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 So, we went through several reasons, right?

565
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 It could be -- what were the reasons I said?

566
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 The man's eyes were dirty and needed to be cleaned out first.

567
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 It could be that Jesus wanted to show that he can heal in many different ways, right?

568
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Not only can he heal instantly, he can heal in a process, a two-step process.

569
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 The third and final reason why Jesus might heal in this way, it had to relate with the disciples.

570
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 This two-step process of healing was a reflection of the disciples' blindness.

571
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Okay, in Mark 8, following this healing, let's read together verse 27.

572
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Okay, verse 27.

573
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Okay, let's read together. One, two, three.

574
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 [Audience reading verse 27]

575
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 "People say, 'I am.' They replied, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others the prophets.'"

576
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Okay, continue.

577
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 "But who do you say about me?" Sorry. "But what do you say about me?"

578
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 He asked, "Who do you say I am?"

579
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Peter answered, "You are the Messiah. You are the Messiah."

580
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 It's interesting because disciples have seen water turn into wine.

581
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 The disciples have seen the healing of the blind, the healing of the deaf, healing of the leper.

582
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And yet, maybe some of them have still been questioning, "Who is Jesus really?

583
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Is he just one of the prophets? Is he like John the Baptist?"

584
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Right?

585
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Who is Jesus? Who is Jesus?

586
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And it is after this specific event in Caesarea Philippi that the disciples are now starting to truly see

587
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 that Jesus is not just a miracle worker.

588
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Jesus is not just another prophet.

589
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Jesus is not just like John the Baptist.

590
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 He is something more.

591
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 He is the Messiah, the one who is promised in the Old Testament.

592
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Let's look at Isaiah chapter 35.

593
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 It says this, "Be strong, do not fear, your God will come.

594
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 He will come with vengeance, with divine retribution. He will come to save you.

595
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Then will the eyes of the blind be open and the ears of the deaf unstopped."

596
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 The Jews, they memorized. A lot of them memorized the Old Testament.

597
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 A lot of them knew what the promises of the Messiah would be, the signs of the Messiah would be.

598
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And after this healing of the blind person, was it truly evidence,

599
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 was it truly proved that Jesus is the one that was promised.

600
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 That he would come to save you.

601
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 The eyes of the blind are opened.

602
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 The deaf would hear.

603
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Jesus could be using this two-step healing process to reveal that the disciples' blindness would also one day be healed.

604
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 That they would see.

605
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 The first part of Jesus' ministry, the disciples couldn't really see.

606
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 They didn't really know who exactly Jesus was.

607
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 But after this healing, the second step, they could start to see.

608
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And it wasn't after the resurrection that they truly understood who Jesus was.

609
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Even during the crucifixion or before the crucifixion, they didn't really understand.

610
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 "Wherever you go, we will follow."

611
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 "No, no, no. The place that I'm going, you cannot come.

612
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 But I will send another helper and he will be with you forever."

613
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 It was a two-step process.

614
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And so the question for us today is also, do we see the real Jesus?

615
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Do we see the real Jesus?

616
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 If you actually look at this, this is actually a picture of the crucifixion.

617
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 We just came back from Explorer Camp and Pastor James was doing the speaking at the camp.

618
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And he was really talking on the theme of real versus fake.

619
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Real versus fake.

620
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And a lot of times in our life, we don't know if it's real or fake.

621
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Especially some of the things you buy.

622
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And Pastor James was talking about the process of buying shoes sometimes.

623
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 You don't know whether it's real or it's fake.

624
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And sometimes you got to look on the internet to see the comparisons between the reals and the fakes.

625
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 And sometimes the reals are so real.

626
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 They're even better quality sometimes than the fakes.

627
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Oh, sorry. The fakes are better quality than the reals.

628
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 The real shoes.

629
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 I remember sometimes I'm buying second-hand shoes.

630
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And I don't want to do that because you don't know sometimes whether it's real or fake.

631
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 You buy it, you compare it, you look at the logo, you look at the material, you look at the box, you look at some of the codes and the numbers.

632
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 And it looks real, but you don't really know for sure.

633
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 You don't know.

634
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And so Pastor James also used another example.

635
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Who got their COVID shot?

636
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 It should be everybody almost, right?

637
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Because Hong Kong is great at that.

638
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Do you know what they do in the vaccine?

639
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 What do they put in you?

640
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Is it some special sauce?

641
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Ketchup?

642
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 What do they put in you?

643
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 They put in you, it's supposed to be a weak version of the virus.

644
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Or a very weak version.

645
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 So that when your body recognizes it and has already healed from it.

646
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 And so when the real version of the virus comes in, it already knows, "Oh, I've gone through this."

647
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 I can heal easily.

648
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 And so a lot of times we have a weaker version of Jesus.

649
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Or a version that we want to see.

650
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 We want to see Jesus as a miracle worker.

651
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 We want to see Jesus as a genie in a bottle.

652
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 "Oh, when I need help, I'll rub the genie and hopefully he'll be there."

653
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Or a light switch.

654
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 "Oh, I'm going to turn it off six days of the week, but when I'm at church on Saturday, I'm going to turn it on and put on my happy Jesus face."

655
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 What version of Jesus do you have?

656
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Is it a weakened version?

657
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Is it a fake version?

658
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Or is it the real Jesus?

659
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 He's not just a miracle worker.

660
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 He's not just like another prophet.

661
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 He is the Messiah.

662
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 The one who is.

663
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 The one who was and will come again.

664
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 Do you know the real Jesus?

665
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 When I was small and I grew up in the church, I saw Jesus was just another Bible story.

666
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Another figure.

667
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 At eight years old, when I asked Jesus into my life, I started to see Jesus as someone I could talk to.

668
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Someone I could pray to.

669
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 When I was 14 and I dedicated my life to Jesus, and Jesus touched my heart and moved me, I saw Jesus as a king that I needed to serve.

670
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 As a king that I needed to serve.

671
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 That I gave up my life to serving.

672
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 As I've gone through the ups and downs of life, I've seen Jesus as a friend who stood by me.

673
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Who's been there for me.

674
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 And as I've gone through different circumstances in life, I've started to see that Jesus and God is a father.

675
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 A father who cares.

676
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 A father who loves.

677
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 A father who's always there.

678
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Have you seen the real Jesus?

679
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Have you seen the real Jesus?

680
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 As I invite the band to come up, I want us to take some time to reflect.

681
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Who is Jesus to you?

682
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Is he just a historical figure?

683
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Who is Jesus to you?

684
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Is he just somebody that you know of?

685
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Or is Jesus your friend?

686
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Someone you personally know.

687
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Someone you personally understand.

688
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Jesus wants to be your friend.

689
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 He wants to be your savior.

690
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 He wants to be your king.

691
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 He wants to be the king of your heart.

692
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Who is Jesus to you?

693
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 We're going to sing the song.

694
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 It's called "Amazing Grace."

695
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.

696
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 I once was blind, but now I can see.

697
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 I once was blind, but now I can see.

698
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
