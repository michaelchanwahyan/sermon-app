1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hello everybody, welcome to church!

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,360
 (singing)

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,000
 I have one and I can't read.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Okay.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,560
 Hello everyone.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,680
 It's good to see you all and it's a joy to be able to bring the Word of God to you

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,200
 in your home. I hope that you're safe and healthy, you have enough masks,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,480
 you have enough toilet roll and hand gel and you're just

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,120
 keeping your spirits up during this crazy, crazy time.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,960
 So the Word of God that we're going to be going through is

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,280
 the title "I am Victorious" and in these next two weeks I'm going to be

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
 finishing off this series from Ephesians by talking about this idea of

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
 that we are victors in Christ. It's going to be split into two parts,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
 this Saturday and next Saturday, so hopefully you'll be able to join us in

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
 some shape or form over these next two weeks. So the first

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
 part is this and I just want to just, as we come to the finale of this

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,120
 series and admittedly it's been so broken

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,160
 with everything that's been happening, but we've been going through Ephesians

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,520
 and we've been talking about this idea of identity, how

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,280
 through this book Paul lays down some key identities that we have as we become

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,320
 Christians, as we become children of God and we are saints and we are blessed, we

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,120
 are appreciated, we are heard, we are saved, we are

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,480
 loved, we are rewarded. Now we come to the finale which is

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,880
 we are victorious, you are victorious and what does that really mean is that's

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
 what we're going to be looking into because

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
 when you think about the word victory it means that you're winning and

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,400
 you know especially right now it doesn't feel like we're winning.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
 There's a virus that is still to be defeated,

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
 there are things that are going on in all of our lives where we don't feel

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,040
 like we're in control, let alone winning and ahead of so

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,160
 it's an interesting topic and what's even more interesting is

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,600
 where this is placed in the scripture. If you look at Ephesians chapter 6

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,800
 it talks about the whole armour of God, this is what we're going to be going

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,520
 through the next two weeks, the whole armour of God, but if you see

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,800
 just how it goes, he starts from the beginning and he's talking about

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,240
 the spiritual blessings that we all have, you have everything you need already,

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,440
 that you have been saved by grace through faith

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,120
 and then it's talking about how we will have spiritual strength

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,520
 and that we will be unified as the body of Christ and then he starts talking

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,560
 about some of the kind of life values or

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,160
 standards that we need to uphold in the way that we live, that we need to walk in

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
 love, Ephesians chapter 5 and then it goes

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
 into how that seeps into our relationships, so your wives and husbands

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,200
 and children and parents and masters and

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
 servants, how we all need to walk in love and

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
 display that love in our relationships and then he finishes here

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,000
 in Ephesians chapter 6 talking about the whole armour of God

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
 and so what he's done here is he's told you who you are, he's told you what you

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
 need to do and just before he leaves he says

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
 right you know everything you need to know now

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
 but there's one thing you need to really be aware of before I leave,

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
 it'll be wrong for me to not tell you this bit and which is this, that

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
 you're going to have to live out your identity, you're going to have to live out

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
 your standards and the values of the

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,120
 kingdom of God, not on a playground but in a battleground,

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,040
 that this isn't going to be easy, whoever thought that this was going to

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
 be an easy life, this won't be, this won't be all fun and

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
 games but rather this will be a battleground,

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
 that is why you need to put on the armour of God, that is why you

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,920
 finally, verse 10, finally be strong in the Lord and put on the whole armour of

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,440
 God. So we're going to today, we're going to

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,080
 unpack what it means to be in battle, we're going to have a think about what

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
 the enemy looks like and finally we're going to look about

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,320
 what the victory looks like, the battle, the enemy,

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,600
 the victory. Next week we're going to be talking about

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,360
 the different pieces, different parts of the whole armour of God

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,960
 and how each of them play a part in the way that we live right now.

68
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,480
 So if you join me, let's just go to Ephesians chapter 6,

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,880
 verse 10 to 13, let me read it to you first, finally be strong in the Lord and

70
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,840
 in the strength of his might, put on the whole armour of God that you

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,480
 may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil,

72
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,680
 for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers, against the

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
 authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
 against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,080
 Therefore take up the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,480
 the evil day and having done all to stand firm.

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,560
 This is the word of the Lord. So when we're talking about

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
 this passage here, we're talking about what Paul is trying to teach

79
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
 the church in Ephesus here, he's really saying, look there is going to be

80
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,400
 a battle, finally, as if this is one of the most important things, finally be

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
 strong in the Lord and the strength of his might, put on the

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,480
 whole armour of God and stand against the schemes of the devil.

83
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,840
 You are going to be up and faced with a big fight, so put on the

84
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,040
 whole armour of God and be strong in the Lord and this battle

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,920
 that we're facing, you know, actually you don't have to tell people living in

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,320
 Hong Kong that life is a battle, this year has been absolutely mad and it

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,360
 feels like a battle, it feels like Hong Kong is clinging

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,600
 for its life. And then I was thinking a bit more about this because in some ways

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,920
 we've only been here for just over a year, I feel as though

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,080
 this is the Hong Kong we've ever known, or this is all we've known,

91
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,040
 just battle, we have the protests from June to

92
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,120
 December and then January the virus took over and it's just been constantly

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,840
 battling, every day has been a grind. But then I was thinking actually,

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
 no, you know, the battle has been going on long before

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,640
 this year, in fact the battle for souls has been going on from the

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,360
 moment Adam and Eve were around, when the serpent

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
 deceived Eve, this battle has been going on for a long time, Peter

98
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,960
 talks about the enemy that is on the prowl, waiting

99
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,880
 to pounce and it makes me think, sometimes even this year I'm thinking,

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,240
 you know what, now more than ever we really need the

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,080
 gospel, the truth of Christ. And I was thinking, no,

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,840
 actually we've all, our need for Jesus and our need for

103
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,400
 the gospel has been the same from the beginning

104
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,880
 of our lives. It's only now, especially this year, especially in Hong Kong,

105
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,400
 it's just a bit more pronounced, we're aware of our shortcomings,

106
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,920
 everything that has happened has now brought all our emotions, all our

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,200
 insecurities and our pride and our fears, all up to the surface. But what our

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,160
 prayer is, is that whilst these things have come up,

109
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,200
 that we will be able to cling on to Christ, that we will be able to be

110
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,760
 strong in the Lord and put on the whole armour of God, so we can face this battle

111
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,760
 together. A battle it is, but hopefully we can keep

112
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,160
 our eyes on the victory. You see, it makes me think,

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,560
 yes there is a battle and the sooner we come to terms with that, the better.

114
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,320
 That actually the moment we even declare ourselves to be Christian,

115
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,240
 at that moment we are taking a stand against the enemy. We are saying we have

116
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,640
 found out our identity and we are holding on to it. Our identity

117
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,600
 is in the one who defeated you, the enemy. And so to be a Christian is to

118
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,040
 engage in spiritual warfare. So it's not to shy away from it, because

119
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,160
 I think sometimes we're guilty of kind of, you know, you hear about the

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,920
 American dream, sometimes we're guilty of pursuing the Christian dream, which is

121
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,040
 oh if I believe in God, things are going to get better for me, things are going to

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,760
 get much smoother, God is going to bless me,

123
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,480
 he's going to give me health, he's going to give me wealth, he's going to give me

124
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,000
 a family, he's going to give me the job that I've always wanted, and then I'm

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,080
 just smooth sailing. But that isn't really what the gospel

126
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,840
 teaches. In fact our Lord Jesus did not seem to live the Christian

127
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,120
 dream, at least not when he came into this world.

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,800
 And so for us, we need to kind of recalibrate our minds of what we think

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
 this life is. And Jesus already told us, he said, "In this world you will have

130
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,800
 trouble. The moment you declare that you belong

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
 to God, the enemy is going to come and try and

132
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,920
 attack you and bring you down with lies, with circumstances, whatever he

133
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,200
 can." And sometimes we look at the problems

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,520
 that we have in society and we're trying to fix these problems with

135
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,720
 earthly solutions. So we look at some of the things that are going on

136
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,080
 outside right now, we're thinking okay well that is because of

137
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
 something that happened here on this earth and we need to try and fix it by

138
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
 doing this, that or the other. And we're not recognising

139
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,920
 that a lot of the problems that we're facing are rooted

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,240
 deep into our souls. And the brokenness isn't just on the surface but it's also

141
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,880
 very much in our hearts. So for us we need to recognise that because in verse

142
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,960
 12, that's what he's talking about, "For we

143
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,560
 don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers, against the

144
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,080
 authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness."

145
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,480
 Our first step into winning this battle is to recognise that it is a battle,

146
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,400
 that there is a battle going on for souls right now,

147
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,160
 even before the protest movement and long after the virus

148
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,920
 disappears, there will still be an ongoing battle for souls.

149
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,440
 And we as believers need to be aware of that, we need to be awake

150
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,080
 and we need to know that God is on the move as well.

151
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,240
 See, the moment we believe in Christ we recognise that there is a victory,

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
 right? You're a Christian because you put your hope in the fact that Christ

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
 died, he rose again, defeated death and that he

154
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,320
 will come again and there will be an ultimate victory.

155
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,280
 But if there is going to be an ultimate victory there also has to be an

156
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,880
 inevitable battle. And this is where we're at right now.

157
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
 The struggle that we have that Paul talks about in the beginning of verse 12,

158
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,080
 what we struggle against, the wrestling match that we have which is face to face

159
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
 is right in our faces, this is the inevitable battle that will

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,640
 lead to the ultimate victory. So let us not be too sad, let us not be

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,440
 too shocked that bad things are happening in this world

162
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,720
 because it was always part of the journey that we're on, ultimately

163
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
 leading to victory with Christ. So that's the first one,

164
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,320
 battle. Now the second one is this, the enemy. In verse 12 it says this,

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
 "For we do not wrestle against the flesh and the blood and the rulers and the

166
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,800
 authorities, the cosmic powers of the present

167
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,840
 darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." What Paul's

168
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,040
 doing here is pointing us to a much bigger picture,

169
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
 that we're not just dealing with each other, you know actually this last year

170
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
 what we've seen is people turning against people, family turning on

171
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,920
 themselves, church people turning against themselves,

172
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,840
 we're getting all these arguments, people blaming each other and lashing out each

173
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,000
 other. But what Paul's saying is don't do that

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
 because our battle, our wrestling match, our struggle is not

175
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,840
 against flesh and blood, it's not against the things that we can see

176
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,600
 but it's against the things that we can't. The forces of darkness that are

177
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,520
 driving behind it, the ones that we can't see

178
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,720
 and that is a powerful, powerful force. And of course I think for us Chinese

179
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
 people it's almost easy to understand that because

180
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,000
 culturally we're a superstitious culture so we know that there are evil forces

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,600
 in action and that's why we have all these superstitions to try and

182
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
 keep them happy, to not make them angry. So we know that there is an

183
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,680
 existence of evil, that demons exist, that there is an enemy,

184
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,000
 there is the devil. But for us it's how can we have once

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
 again a healthy outlook, a balanced

186
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,840
 outlook on the enemy, to not be so scared that we think

187
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,280
 everything that's happening is because of him, that actually we

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,320
 recognize that inside our own hearts that we have the capacity to do evil,

189
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,960
 that actually I don't need any help to set myself on a path of

190
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,400
 self-destruction, I can do that myself, thank you very much.

191
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,080
 But rather the enemy doesn't have a control of us to force us to do things

192
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,240
 but rather he simply presents as it was some of the sinful desires that we

193
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,720
 already have and recognizing the level of power that

194
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,600
 this enemy has. And C.S. Lewis talks about it in this way,

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,400
 he says it's important to understand that they are equal and

196
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,320
 unhealthy opposites when it comes to talking about Satan,

197
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
 opposite errors if you will. One is that you don't believe in him at all

198
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,520
 and the other is that you have an unhealthy and exaggerated

199
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,720
 interest in him. Because the truth is the enemy is not omnipotent,

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,000
 so he's not everywhere at the same time, so he doesn't control

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,240
 everything. But what he does do is try his best to feed lies into our

202
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
 minds, to cause us to trip up on the things

203
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,600
 that we in some ways our human nature wants us to do anyway. Except for us it's

204
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
 about not getting, not allowing him to get a

205
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,400
 foothold on us, to recognize that he is powerful but he is also vulnerable.

206
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,960
 And that we worship him, we are loved by a God who is

207
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,200
 all-powerful and all-loving. And that he has already

208
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
 defeated the enemy. The victory is on its way, it's simply just

209
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,360
 a matter of time and it's down to us to be ready and to

210
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,280
 be up for this battle for now. And it's a wrestle,

211
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,200
 that imagery there is that it's close up, this isn't something you see

212
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
 from very far away, this is really in your face. When you're wrestling

213
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,520
 there's a struggle, there's resistance that's coming at you

214
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,840
 and the whole point of this wrestle is, at least for me, is

215
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,760
 through this battle, through this struggle, I know I will get stronger.

216
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,640
 I know that as I find out more about God, I find out more about myself and I find

217
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,680
 out more ways about how the enemy can't touch

218
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,040
 me and he can't harm me. So this battle, whilst we should be very

219
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,680
 much aware of the enemy, we should also not be afraid. Because

220
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,400
 finally there is the victory. The verse 13 says this,

221
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,480
 "Therefore take up the whole armour of God,

222
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,400
 that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all

223
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,960
 to stand firm." Having done all to stand firm.

224
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,800
 You know, when we're talking about a battle, one of the most

225
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,240
 famous films from the last couple years is Avengers,

226
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,120
 Endgame, there's this epic final battle at the very end and of course

227
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
 Thanos comes with his whole gang and then

228
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,520
 the Avengers, they assemble and they start fighting.

229
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,880
 And there's this moment where, if I remember correctly,

230
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,040
 it's not fully accurate, but it's the Avengers are starting to struggle. During

231
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,280
 the battle things are getting hard, the enemy is coming at them even harder,

232
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,480
 and things are getting a bit more discouraging, it looks like defeat might

233
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
 be on its way. And then you have this extra powerful

234
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,160
 superhero in Captain Marvel who comes, who almost just buoys everyone, just lifts

235
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,760
 everyone's spirits, because they know that, wow, she's here

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,640
 and she is powerful and she can help them.

237
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,080
 And I've just tried to imagine the battle that we're facing and

238
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,520
 trust me, I think life, and no doubt it's the same for you,

239
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,840
 life at the moment sometimes feels like a real, just a real fight where I'm just

240
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,800
 on my knees and I'm just clinging on, trying to stand firm. And this battle

241
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 against the enemy sometimes feels too hard,

242
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
 especially when we try and take things into our own hands, when we try and

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,720
 defeat this enemy through our own common sense, our own ability, our own wisdom,

244
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,560
 and we realize, oh, we're maybe not as powerful as we thought, but the enemy is

245
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,080
 more powerful than us. And we're on our knees and I just had

246
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,040
 this image that actually Jesus comes up to us and just

247
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,760
 whispers to us in the most subtle of ways saying, "Get back up,

248
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,720
 the victory is coming, it's on its way." And just don't be, don't lose heart,

249
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
 take heart, in this world you will have trouble,

250
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,120
 take heart for I have overcome the world, just hang on there,

251
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,840
 stand firm, having done all, stand firm, and take up the whole armour of God.

252
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,200
 And even though I'm going to be going through the specific parts of the whole

253
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,480
 armour of God next week, I wanted just to finish off by sharing

254
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,840
 some of the things that pop up in my mind when Paul writes this in

255
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,280
 verse 13, "take up the whole armour of God." And for me,

256
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,400
 it really, there's two things that really pop up.

257
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,520
 One is that we have to be ready and the other is

258
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,520
 we have to be obedient. So the first one first, we have to be ready.

259
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,360
 The whole point of putting on armour is you put it on before the battle. You

260
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,920
 don't end up in a battlefield where people are

261
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,200
 slinging shots at you and trying to attack you, you

262
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,880
 don't walk in there without the armour and say, "Pause,

263
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,560
 I can see this is a battle, let me pop back into the changing room,

264
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,520
 slip into something more appropriate and I'll come back out and we'll carry on

265
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,480
 fighting." No, the whole point of this imagery of being a battle and

266
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,440
 wearing the whole armour of God is that you do it beforehand.

267
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,080
 Just like these days as we're going out, before we go out we put on the masks

268
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,440
 to protect ourselves. And if only we would

269
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,160
 protect and prepare our souls and our whole beings as well as we are

270
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,760
 in trying to protect ourselves from the virus. And actually maybe

271
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,440
 if only we would be so committed to protecting our bodies and maintaining

272
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,440
 healthy lifestyles and balanced diets as much as we are trying to protect from

273
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,160
 this virus that will pass. And this idea of we have to be prepared,

274
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,080
 we have to be ready. Growing up in school, in the school

275
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,200
 changing rooms, I used to see just a post that was up

276
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,360
 there when I was about 15 years old and just says,

277
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,440
 "Fail to prepare and prepare to fail. Fail to prepare and prepare to fail."

278
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,160
 This idea of we have to be prepared, we have to be ready. The whole point of

279
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,760
 putting on the armour is that you do it beforehand and that

280
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
 you do it on a daily basis, that you pick up your armour and you protect yourself

281
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
 on a daily basis. And we'll go through next week what each part of the

282
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,040
 whole armour of God does. But that for me is the first one. That the victory is

283
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,440
 already confirmed, we just have to be ready. See I was

284
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
 flying recently and of course everything happening,

285
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,120
 a lot of the flights are cancelled. So they're cancelled or delayed or changing because

286
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,520
 borders are shutting and whatnot. And so when I finally saw

287
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,160
 on my screen, "Your flight is confirmed." That brought me relief. I'm finally going

288
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
 home. I can see that my flight has finally

289
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
 been confirmed. The one that was before was cancelled,

290
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
 but now this one is confirmed. And that's great in some ways, that's just exactly

291
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,520
 like the victory that is already confirmed by Christ. It's already done.

292
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,240
 But even though I received the email saying that the flight was confirmed,

293
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,320
 I still had to get ready. I still had to make sure I had packed everything I

294
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
 needed. I still had to make sure that I had my

295
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,880
 passport, that I had everything I need to check in. I still need to make sure

296
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,280
 that I get myself to the airport on time so I can catch that flight.

297
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,720
 So even though the flight is confirmed, there's still lots of things that I can

298
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,320
 do to make sure that I am ready. And in some ways it's the same. We know

299
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,600
 that there is a battle. We know there's a battle because we

300
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,480
 believe in the victory that is coming at the end, and the one that's already

301
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
 happened 2,000 years ago. So for us, if we know the victory is

302
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,240
 confirmed, our job is to be ready, is to be prepared, to protect

303
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,400
 ourselves, to continue to guard our hearts and guard

304
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,520
 our minds. And recognising that the battle has

305
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,160
 already been won, but it's our job to also, second point, be obedient. So we have

306
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,880
 to be ready and also be obedient. Because you know

307
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,640
 here, the passage says, "Put on the whole armour of God." Not just put on

308
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,560
 your armour, not just put on your own armour, not put on James's armour,

309
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,920
 but to put on the whole armour of God. You see, the moment you put on the armour

310
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,880
 of God, the moment you put, and a soldier puts on any armour,

311
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,400
 they identify with that army. And so when Paul says, "Put on the whole

312
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,920
 armour of God," it's basically saying, you identify yourself as a warrior and as a

313
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,920
 soldier and as a child of God. And what that means

314
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,960
 is if you are part of his army, then you also do as he says.

315
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,880
 And recognising that this is not our fight, that we can't think of what is the

316
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,680
 best way to defeat the enemy, God knows. Our job as his soldiers, our job as we

317
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,800
 put on his armour is to be obedient. Imagine if soldiers

318
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,520
 would question the instructions from their sergeants and their lieutenants.

319
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,520
 That wouldn't work right. Our job is to put on the armour

320
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,640
 and be ready and be obedient to God because we know that his thoughts

321
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,360
 and his ways are so much higher than ours. I came across a quote recently

322
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,560
 by Alexander the Great and he said this, "I'm not afraid

323
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,400
 of an army of lions led by a sheep. I'm afraid

324
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,680
 of an army of sheep led by a lion. I'm not afraid of an army of lions led by a

325
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,880
 sheep. I'm afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion."

326
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,640
 And we are that army of sheep. We are following

327
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,320
 the Good Shepherd. We are following Christ, the Lion and the Lamb.

328
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,680
 We are following him and we know that if we follow him,

329
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,840
 go back to verse 10, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his mind.

330
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,360
 If we follow him, if we are ready for him, if we are prepared,

331
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,640
 if we are obedient, if we stick to him, then the victory

332
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,120
 that is his will be the victory that is ours.

333
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
 And so therefore, having done all, stand firm.

334
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,800
 See this is interesting because when we think about warfare, we maybe think

335
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,400
 about more contemporary warfare, about getting behind enemy lines,

336
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,480
 about being on the attack, about invading their bases, whether that's

337
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,680
 in contemporary warfare that we see on the news or maybe in just

338
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,440
 contemporary gaming that we see. It's all about attacking and invading that place.

339
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,040
 But here, this is interesting because if you

340
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,480
 look at these verses here, the word 'stand' comes up an awful lot.

341
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,760
 And it's interesting because it's not attack, it's not run, it's not invade,

342
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,120
 it's just stand. It's saying here, withstand the schemes of the enemy.

343
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,120
 It's saying, take your stand. It almost comes from a

344
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,320
 place where it's simply just, you just have to defend

345
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,000
 what you already have. You see I think that's interesting because what it's

346
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,160
 saying here, if you take it in the context of whole

347
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,720
 of Ephesians, our identity is already there, our salvation is

348
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,440
 already set. The kingdom of God has already won.

349
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,480
 Our leader, our commander has already put death to death through death.

350
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,680
 And so what the enemy is trying to do is to break that down.

351
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,160
 But we already have it, we are in a place of security,

352
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,920
 of victory and all we have to do is stand.

353
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,560
 Is to stand firm, to withstand the assault because our identity has already

354
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,440
 been secured, our salvation is already ours. And we can

355
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,840
 stand because of who stands with us. That we can

356
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,560
 withstand the forces of evil because Christ himself

357
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,400
 came down to earth and withstood all the forces of evil. He absorbed

358
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,680
 all the darknesses and the consequences of our sin

359
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,960
 on our behalf and he put them all to death and he withstood them all and he

360
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,720
 stood and he remains Lord of all and that is why we have the courage to

361
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,960
 also do the same. So finally be strong in the Lord in the

362
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,880
 strength of his might so that you may be able to withstand in

363
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,240
 the evil day having done all to stand firm. So that's I am

364
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,800
 victorious part one, that there is a basket that was

365
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,720
 happening long before this year, it's obviously happening now and it

366
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,000
 will happen after the crisis that is in Hong Kong

367
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,080
 passes as well. The battle for souls remains, it is here.

368
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,240
 The battle for your soul remains and it is a battle and it's a struggle and a

369
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,280
 wrestle. That's why we do it together, that's why

370
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,160
 we stick to Christ. The battle against the enemy

371
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,840
 who we can't see, who is more powerful than us.

372
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,920
 Who often points us to some of the darkest places within our own hearts

373
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,680
 but remembering that he has no control over us.

374
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,360
 We need to resist him, we need to not let him have a foothold

375
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
 on our lives but from there we need to stand firm

376
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,400
 and be confident because finally the victory is

377
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,920
 already ours. The victory is confirmed, we just have to be ready, prepared

378
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,880
 and obedient to follow our commander. Brothers and sisters, I certainly miss

379
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,320
 all of you very dearly and I pray that this week as you

380
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,760
 head into the battle again, as you don the masks

381
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,200
 and the hand gel and that you would also put on the whole

382
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,360
 armour of God, knowing that the moment you put it on

383
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,840
 you are ready, you are strong, you are protected and that he is for you

384
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:10,480
 and none can be against. Bless you.
