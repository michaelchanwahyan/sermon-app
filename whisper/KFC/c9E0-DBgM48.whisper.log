[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   - Heavenly Father, we thank you for this time
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.000]   that we can read your word,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.900]   that we can meditate on it and understand it.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.500]   And I ask that Lord, your Holy Spirit would empower me now
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.400]   as I preach your word,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700]   that Lord, it may not be my words,
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.700]   but it would be your words, Father,
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.700]   that you would soften our hearts to receive your word now.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.200]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.700]   All right, good evening, everybody.
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.500]   Hope you're doing well.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.500]   And we finished 1 Timothy,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.300]   and now we are on to 2 Timothy.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.000]   And in 1 Timothy, Paul charged Timothy,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.800]   who was a pastor, a young and upcoming pastor,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.200]   to uphold the truth, to pray, to lead, to serve,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   to love others, and also to fight the good fight of faith.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.500]   And now he starts off his second letter.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000]   And once again, he introduces himself, right?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Paul, he's an apostle who he's talking to, to Timothy.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   He treats him like a dear son, right?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And he blesses him with grace and mercy and peace from God.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Paul is actually writing from jail in this second time.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Has anybody been to Rome?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I know you have.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   This is the second time.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Has anybody been to Rome before?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   Anybody been to Rome before?
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500]   Has anybody been to the Roman Forum there?
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.300]   Right around the Roman Forum is the prison
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.800]   that they believe Paul was imprisoned
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.000]   in his second imprisonment in Rome.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.600]   And you can see it's a dark cave.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.100]   It's not a nice place to live.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100]   It's kind of roomy actually for Hong Kong.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100]   But I still wouldn't rent it probably.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.100]   Not enough light, I think.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.500]   Although when you go visit it now,
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.200]   it's nicely lit up for you as you visit it.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   Paul was in his last days, before he was to be executed,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   before he was to be judged in Rome.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700]   And this was the condition he was living in.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   A dark, moist hole where food was dropped down to him.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.100]   And where was Timothy?
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.400]   He was writing to Timothy and Timothy was in Ephesus
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   as you see in the next picture.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.100]   Ephesus was the New York of that day, right?
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.100]   That's where all the craziest,
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.600]   brightest things were happening at that time.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.700]   Ephesus was the New York of those times.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.800]   And so Paul is writing to Timothy.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.900]   And how do you usually start off a letter?
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.100]   Or how do you usually start off an email?
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.800]   How do you guys usually start off?
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.100]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.400]   It was really good seeing you last time.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.800]   Thank you, Albert, for coming today.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.300]   Yeah, Albert's waving.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.000]   Paul does the same thing.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   He's like, hey, I wanna thank several things
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.200]   before I get started in this letter.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.400]   And he says, I thank you firstly,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.900]   for God whom I serve as my ancestors did.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.000]   And so he's thankful for the Israelites
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.400]   that God had called them to be his people.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.700]   The second thing he is thankful for
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.800]   is his personal relationship with Timothy.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.200]   In verse four, he says he recalls the tears
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.100]   that Timothy had.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.000]   I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   They had a very close, deep, personal relationship.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.400]   And the third thing that Paul is thankful for
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.900]   is the faith that Timothy had.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.400]   And this faith was actually passed down
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   from his grandmother to his mother, and now to him.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.100]   And some of us were at Joe and Alex's wedding
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.800]   on Monday, and one of the great things
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   that we remembered was Joe's father.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.200]   He was a great man of faith,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   and that faith was passed on to James and Joseph.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.600]   And they were able to celebrate that,
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.400]   that faith on that wedding day as well.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.900]   And so now Paul goes into the heart of his letter,
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.400]   or the first part of his letter,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.700]   and he says to guard, "Timothy, guard several things.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.300]   The first thing is guard the physical gifts
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.100]   that the Spirit has given you.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.100]   Guard your emotions.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.800]   Guard the spiritual truth that I've passed down to you
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.700]   in the gospel.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.700]   Guard your commitment.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.700]   Stand guard."
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.300]   And when I think about guard,
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.800]   I really like to think about those guards
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.200]   that stand outside the Queen's Palace.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.400]   Has anybody been there before?
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.500]   So, yeah?
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.300]   Has anybody taken selfies with those guards before?
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.000]   Michelle has.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It's amazing, right?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Michelle takes all sort of selfies with them,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.700]   makes funny faces, and what do they do?
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.700]   Do they make faces as well?
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.600]   No, they are stone-faced.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.200]   They, I don't know, look at something.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.900]   I don't know what they're looking at.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.100]   Stone-faced.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.000]   They're emotionally blank, it seems,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   or focused, emotionally focused, mentally focused,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.400]   committed to their, do their job
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.200]   of guarding the Queen's Palace.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.300]   Although I watched that Netflix show,
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.200]   and it showed that somebody jumped the fence
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   and stole something, right?
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.000]   So, I don't know.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.300]   Maybe at night, they're not on guard.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.700]   I don't know.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.200]   But Paul tells Timothy to also stand guard.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.500]   And the first thing he tells them to stand guard
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.400]   is as we read in verse six,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.000]   "For this reason, because of your faith,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.500]   "I remind you to fan into flame
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.000]   "the gift of God, which is in you
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.800]   "through the laying of hands."
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.600]   Fan into flame, the gift that has been given to you,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.100]   the spiritual gifts that have been in you.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.500]   Another translation is stir up, fan into flame.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.800]   Who knows how to start a fire?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.000]   Who knows how to start a fire?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.500]   Paul knows how to start a fire?
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.100]   Okay, Paul, how do you start a fire?
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.100]   The traditional way.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.500]   - Well, you can get some lint and spark,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.300]   or just use a lighter.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.200]   - Traditional way.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.700]   - Traditional way.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.500]   - Oh, just rub some sticks together.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.200]   - Right, rub sticks together.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.900]   And then what else do you do afterwards?
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.200]   - Rub more sticks together.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.600]   - Right, okay.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.300]   All right, rub more sticks together.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.700]   And then eventually, there's a spark.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.100]   And then Michelle's doing this,
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.500]   and it's not 'cause Philemon's beside him.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.300]   And he's smelling, I'm joking.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.200]   But you gotta fan into flame, right?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.000]   Fan into flame.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.400]   There's this combustion that happens
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.900]   between oxygen and this spark that happens.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.500]   What happens when you're doing your barbecue?
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.600]   You know, Hong Kong people love those barbecues.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.300]   And you leave the coal.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.400]   What happens to it?
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   Does it get eventually brighter and brighter?
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.700]   No, it starts to die.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.700]   It starts to die down.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.200]   And Paul is telling Timothy here,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.100]   the gifts that you've been given,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.900]   don't just stay, you know, and don't use them.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.200]   Don't be passive and sit on the couch.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.100]   He's saying fan into fame.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.700]   Stir up, be active, not passive.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.700]   The gifts, the spiritual gifts that you've been given,
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.000]   fan into flame.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.300]   I'm reminded of that parable, that story that Jesus told,
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.900]   the parable of the talents.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   The master was gonna go away on a trip,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.600]   maybe a staycation, all right?
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.100]   And on the staycation, he was like,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   "Oh, I should entrust my wealth to some of my servants."
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.900]   And to one he gave, how much?
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.800]   10, oh no, see, tricked you, five.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.100]   To the other he gave, two.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.200]   And to one, to the other one, he gave one,
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.600]   according to their ability, right?
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.000]   As the scripture says.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   And most people who have gifts or who have wealth,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   they start to invest it.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   And so do the ones that have been trusted with two
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.800]   and the one with four or five.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.500]   And what happens is they multiply.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   They double what they've made.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.100]   But there's one servant here,
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.400]   the one that's been trusted with one.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.400]   And Jesus says, what was his emotion?
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.700]   He was afraid.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.100]   And so what did he do?
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.100]   He dug up a hole and hid his talent.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.000]   He hid his talent.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.900]   And Paul is telling Timothy here,
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.000]   "Be like those servants who've been entrusted
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.400]   "with money, with talent, and multiply it."
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.600]   Stir up those gifts, use them.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.400]   Fan into flame those gifts.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.700]   Anybody grow up in Canada here?
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.100]   Canadian, Canadia, a couple people.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.600]   In Canada, there's two main languages.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   Do you know what?
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.300]   It's not Chinese, Cantonese.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.800]   It's French, en Francais.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.300]   Bonjour, ça va bien?
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:24.000]   Okay, Albert is slightly recalling those years.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.900]   In Canada, you have to learn French
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.600]   because it's also the other official language.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.400]   And I learned it from grade one to grade 10.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.600]   I actually took it in grade 10 as well.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.800]   So imagine spending probably, I don't know,
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.400]   an hour, an hour and a half, five days a week
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.700]   learning that for 10 years.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.100]   You should say, "Well, Johnny,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.300]   "your French should be amazing, right?
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.900]   "You should like, it should be better than your Cantonese."
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.500]   I actually don't remember any French.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.600]   I mean, Michelle could barely recount the numbers, right?
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.500]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.700]   She knows one, two, three.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.000]   What happens when we don't use our gifts?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.700]   We lose it, we lose it.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.300]   And my French is bad,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.000]   even though I spent all those hours learning.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.300]   And if we don't use the spiritual gifts
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   that we've been given, we may lose it as well.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.500]   And so Paul tells Timothy,
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.200]   "Fan into flame the gifts that you have
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.900]   "that's in you with the laying of hands."
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.000]   The laying of hands, it shows community,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.400]   the body of Christ working together.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.300]   It shows dedication as we anoint our pastors,
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.900]   our reverends to serve.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.700]   The second thing that Paul tells Timothy
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.600]   as we continue in verse seven,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.300]   "For the spirit God gave us does not make us timid,
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   "but gives us power, love, and self-discipline."
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.600]   In other translations, it says,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.500]   "God's spirit doesn't make you afraid of people."
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:34.400]   So this sort of tells us that possibly Timothy was timid.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.300]   He was maybe a bit shy or a bit laid back.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:46.200]   Maybe he was a normal, a person of normal courage,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.300]   but he had so much work to cover, so much work to do, right?
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.400]   Sometimes ministry can be overwhelming.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.100]   Maybe it might not have been just this church in Ephesus,
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.100]   but a lot of churches surrounding him.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.300]   So he was overwhelmed.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.300]   And so Paul is telling Timothy,
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.100]   "Don't be timid, don't be afraid,
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.600]   "don't be fearful,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:14.400]   "because the Holy Spirit gives us power,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.500]   "love, and self-discipline."
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.800]   We need discernment.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.500]   We need discernment.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.000]   Because sometimes we're afraid of things
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.600]   that God isn't telling us to be afraid of.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, right?
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.900]   But sometimes we fear things that we shouldn't be fearing.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:48.500]   And these fears, they start to disable us, hinder us.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.400]   Maybe we're afraid to start a ministry
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.900]   because we think, "Oh, we don't know if anybody will come."
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.100]   Sometimes we do that, right?
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.300]   Like, "Oh, should we start a ministry?
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.300]   "Like, oh, should we start Alpha this season?
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.000]   "Because we don't know if anybody's gonna sign up.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.500]   "What if nobody signs up?
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.900]   "Then it's just me doing Alpha by myself
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.400]   "with my helpers, the three of us.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.340]   "Should we start it?
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.900]   "I don't know, I'm afraid.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.700]   "Maybe, oh, I'm afraid to serve
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.700]   "because, oh, I don't know if I'm good enough.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.400]   "Maybe I don't wanna serve
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.600]   "because, oh, I don't know what other people will think of me.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.800]   "What if I do a bad job
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.500]   "and people will look differently upon me
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.900]   "and look down on me?"
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:45.400]   Sometimes fears hold us back.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   Fears hold us back.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.800]   And Paul is telling Timothy, "Do not be afraid
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.500]   "because the Holy Spirit gives us power."
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.100]   The power to save lives,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.700]   the power to serve Him with His gifts,
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.700]   the power to love people.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.700]   That is the central aim of ministry,
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.500]   to love people, to love God and His people.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.700]   God also gave us the Holy Spirit
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:27.200]   for sound mind or self-discipline, as it says.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.100]   Fear or distraction can take control of our ministry.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.100]   That God's Spirit imparts steadiness, steadiness.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.500]   So are we paralyzed by fear
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.000]   or are we courageous in faith?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.500]   Are we paralyzed by fear or are we courageous in faith?
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.200]   One of the summer activities that we did
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.800]   in the Titus Fellowship
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.700]   was we went bouldering, indoor bouldering.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.800]   Anybody been indoor bouldering before?
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.700]   It's quite popular nowadays.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.600]   So you climb up and then there's these like really soft mats
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.500]   and you can just jump down or whatnot, right?
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.000]   Or down climb and then jump when it's a safe distance.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.100]   But as some people climb higher and higher,
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:23.600]   they start to possibly be afraid, afraid of heights.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   And when they're afraid of heights, what happens?
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.200]   They start to panic and maybe they'll jump down
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.800]   or maybe they won't be able to climb the rest of the route.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.200]   Fear paralyzes them,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.300]   prevents them from doing what they can do.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.500]   Are we paralyzed by fear
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.600]   or are we courageous in faith as we depend on His Spirit?
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.500]   The third thing that Paul tells Timothy
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   as we read in verse eight here
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.200]   is that do not be ashamed of the gospel
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   or the testimony about our Lord or of me, His prisoner.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.400]   Rather, join me in suffering for the gospel
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.300]   by the power of God.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.900]   He has saved us and called us to a holy life.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:20.800]   The third thing that Paul tells Timothy to guard
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.600]   is the gospel, the spiritual truth.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.800]   Don't be ashamed of the gospel.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.100]   And Paul certainly wasn't ashamed, right?
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.700]   He was willing to go wherever God told him,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.200]   even when it meant trial,
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.800]   even when it meant imprisonment.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.500]   He was not ashamed.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.000]   And he went so far as to say to Timothy here,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.500]   "Join me in suffering.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.500]   Join me in suffering for the gospel."
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.900]   And Paul's reasoning is this.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.100]   It's because this gospel has saved us
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.300]   as we see in the next slide.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.400]   Paul's reasoning is that this gospel
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.600]   has called us to a holy life
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   and it has given us grace.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:18.100]   And this grace came with the appearing of Jesus Christ
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.600]   which destroyed death and sin
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.300]   and has brought life, an eternal life.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.300]   And that is why Paul is a preacher.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.600]   He's preaching this gospel so fervently.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.100]   That is why he's an apostle.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.000]   An apostle is one that is called to go
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.600]   and take the gospel where it is not.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.300]   An apostle is one that writes the word of God,
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.400]   has been given that gift.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.100]   He's a teacher of the gospel as well.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.700]   And Paul tells Timothy here
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.600]   to hold fast, to keep the gospel,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.100]   hold fast to it
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:12.200]   because it is sound teaching.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.100]   It is reasonable.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.400]   It is truthful.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.200]   And you hold fast to it.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   And as you hold fast to it,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.300]   your faith is revealed
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.300]   and the love of Christ is revealed.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.800]   As we see in the next slide here,
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.900]   guarding the gospel truth
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.700]   reflects our faith and love.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.700]   As we guard the truth of God in our lives,
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.600]   we automatically reveal our faith.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.500]   Automatically we reveal the love of God.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   As we go about standing up for the truth,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.600]   we can't help but show the faith that we have
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.600]   in what God has done for us and to love others around us.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.200]   Okay, the last thing that Paul tells Timothy in verse 14
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.600]   is to guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.800]   So Paul spent a lot of verses saying, guard the truth.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.100]   The truth is so important
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.200]   because there were so many false teachers
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.600]   and so many false prophets, right?
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.400]   The truth is so important.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.000]   How we are saved.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.400]   It's not by works.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.300]   It's through faith.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   And the last thing that Paul tells Timothy
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   is to guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.600]   Now, what is this good deposit?
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.800]   What is this good deposit?
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.400]   Well, in other translations,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.800]   the New Living Translation,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   it says through the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.200]   who lives within us, carefully guard the precious truth
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.600]   that has been entrusted to you.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   So it could be continuing what Paul has been already saying.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.000]   He's saying, guard the truth.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.700]   And he's saying, before he was saying, keep the truth.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.000]   And now he's saying, guard the truth as well.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.600]   Other people could think it is possibly the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.840]   right?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   In Ephesians, he says he put his spirit in our hearts
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.040]   as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:47.540]   All right, this deposit is our passport to heaven.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.540]   Could be the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.040]   In other translations, the New King James Version,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.740]   it says this, the good thing which was committed to you,
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.440]   keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.340]   Or another translation says, guard the treasure
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.340]   that is entrusted to you with the help of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.040]   All right, let's have a wager here.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.540]   What do you guys think it is?
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.240]   Who thinks it's the truth, the good deposit?
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.060]   Anybody?
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.960]   The truth?
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.340]   Okay, Florence, maybe Vincent.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.400]   Oh, Bonnie thinks it's the truth.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.540]   Yeah, okay.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.440]   All right, more takers.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.840]   Who thinks it's the Holy Spirit?
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.000]   Anybody?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.840]   Anybody?
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.040]   Okay.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.160]   Michelle, Albert.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.460]   Okay, four, five.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.240]   Okay, six.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.640]   Holy Spirit.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   Who thinks this good thing possibly is the ministry
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:54.400]   or this treasure, this ministry that God has given Timothy?
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.340]   Anybody?
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.240]   Any takers?
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.940]   Ministry?
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.700]   No, no takers?
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.100]   Okay, who has no idea?
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.940]   Raise your hand.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.760]   Who has no idea?
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.240]   No idea?
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.060]   Okay.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.960]   Okay, and the last option.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.440]   Who thinks it could be all of the above?
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.200]   Okay, Paul just like totally raises his hand
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.100]   like he won the lottery or something.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.740]   (laughing)
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.560]   Me.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.740]   I possibly think it might be all of the above.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.600]   Paul is telling Timothy,
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.100]   the thing that you've been entrusted,
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.200]   what has Timothy been entrusted with?
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.800]   He's been entrusted with the truth,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   the pass on the truth, absolutely.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.900]   He's been entrusted with the church
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.560]   that he's been given to pastor that church,
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.200]   with the congregation he is to serve.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.460]   And he has been blessed with the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.260]   That empowers him, that teaches him to counsel him.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:09.700]   In the parable of the talents,
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.700]   Paul, just like how this master is saying,
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:20.260]   he entrusts his servants with precious things, right?
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:24.060]   Not garbage things.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.260]   He's entrusting him with significant things.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.100]   These talents are worth a lot.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.500]   They mean a lot to the master.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:39.100]   And I think likewise, Paul is saying to Timothy,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.260]   God has entrusted you with so much.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:50.300]   With the truth, with your ministry, with your church.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.260]   He's given you the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.700]   And so you must guard those things
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.700]   with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:10.500]   And so Paul, to recap, Paul is telling Timothy
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.500]   to firstly guard the physical, spiritual gifts
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.800]   that he's been given.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.460]   Paul is telling him to guard his emotions.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.260]   It's easy to be overcome by fear.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.660]   But overcome fear through the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.100]   the spirit of power, love, and self-discipline.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.820]   We need to guard spiritual truth.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.300]   'Cause in those days, there were so many false prophets.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.500]   And today we also have many false prophets.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.460]   We must also guard the truth.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.500]   And lastly, Paul is telling Timothy
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.100]   to guard the things that have been committed to him.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:02.900]   The truth, his church, the people he's mentoring,
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.500]   guard those things.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:12.100]   And so here is some application.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.100]   Paul tells Timothy to guard his spiritual truths.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.900]   Are we using our spiritual gifts?
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.100]   Are we using our spiritual gifts?
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.500]   Or are we hiding it?
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.500]   Are we hiding it?
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.820]   Are you making up all sorts of excuses?
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.100]   Oh, I'm too busy.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.500]   Oh, I have work.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.500]   Oh, I have to take care of this and that.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:42.700]   Or are we investing time to serve the Lord?
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.100]   The second thing is, are we overcome by fear?
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.820]   Are we courageous in faith?
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.700]   We need to seek discernment.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.220]   Is this fear from God?
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.420]   Or is this fear from the devil,
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.300]   preventing me from serving God,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.300]   paralyzing me from doing what God wants me to do?
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.900]   We need to seek discernment and surrender to the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:25.500]   And we also need to reflect the truth
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.100]   and the life of Christ in our life.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:34.900]   Every day, as we go to work, as we go to school,
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:42.300]   the media, everybody is telling you something different
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.700]   from what the truth is.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.900]   We're bombarded every day
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.900]   with something other than the truth.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.500]   And we need to protect the word of God.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.700]   And we need to reflect that truth and life in our life.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:04.300]   And lastly, what have you been entrusted with?
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.500]   What has God entrusted you with?
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.700]   Maybe it's the worship team.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.700]   Maybe God has entrusted you with responsibilities at work.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.100]   Maybe it's seminary.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:22.500]   Maybe it's your schooling right now.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   Maybe God has entrusted you with friends and family
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   who don't know Jesus yet.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.900]   And He wants you to commit your life
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.900]   to sharing His love and His truth to them.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:43.900]   Are you willing to stand on guard?
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.100]   Are you willing to stand on guard?
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.100]   And the last thing I think about when I'm standing on guard
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.700]   is Hong Kong's first gold medal.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.500]   What's his name?
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   What's his name?
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.700]   Cheung Ka-long, Edgar Cheung.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.300]   Do you know what he was ranked in the world rankings
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.700]   before he went to win the gold medal?
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.100]   Do you know what he was ranked?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.200]   10, good guess.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.400]   Any other takers?
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.200]   He was ranked 19th.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.500]   19th.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.600]   He wasn't expected to win.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:32.200]   That's like Canada winning the World Cup.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.600]   Is Canada worth 19?
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.000]   Probably not even 19.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.100]   Right?
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.600]   Probably 100 something, right?
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.440]   Canada's.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.000]   This is what he said.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.900]   "I thought to myself,
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.200]   "everyone was either an Olympic champion
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.900]   "or a world champion, and I was nobody.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.400]   "That helped me to relax a bit.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.100]   "At this moment, I still cannot believe
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.300]   "that I'm the champion."
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.100]   He was so, under so much pressure,
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.000]   and he had to relax himself.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.600]   Timothy was also overwhelmed
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.700]   by all the ministry that he had to do.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.800]   Maybe all the false teachers that were attacking him.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   He was also overwhelmed,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.300]   but he was willing to stand on guard
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   as Paul encouraged him.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.300]   And Edgar Chan says, Cheung says this,
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:41.100]   "After winning, I told myself, I can't get complacent.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:46.100]   "I'll continue to work hard to bring glory to Hong Kong."
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.200]   To bring glory to Hong Kong.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:54.400]   Imagine if we as Christians
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.700]   are as committed
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.900]   to guarding Christ and his truth
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.000]   as much as Edgar is willing
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.900]   to devote himself to a sport of fencing.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.400]   He dedicated his life,
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.000]   started from a young age to fencing,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.100]   and eventually he worked so hard,
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.400]   even though he was the underdog,
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.900]   he won the gold medal.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.000]   Are we willing to dedicate our life
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.700]   to guard the gospel truth,
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.400]   to stand for his truth,
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.700]   to use our gifts,
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.300]   dedicate our life,
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:40.100]   protect what has been entrusted to us?
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.700]   Are we willing to do that?
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:47.500]   And then eventually, we will also be champions.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.000]   Champions for the Lord.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.400]   To receive the crown of glory
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.300]   that Jesus has promised
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.900]   and Paul later talks about
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.000]   in the rest of the chapters.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Let us take some time to respond
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.500]   as the band comes up.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.000]   Are we willing to stand on guard?
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Let's take a moment to just think about
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.300]   what has God entrusted you with?
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.600]   Your gifts.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:34.400]   Your ministry.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.000]   The people around you.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.300]   The truth, the Bible, gospel truth.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.100]   God has entrusted you with these things.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:51.300]   Are you willing to guard these things?
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.400]   To use these things, fan into flame?
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.900]   The gifts that you have been given.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.100]   Surrender these things.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   Surrender your emotions, your fears to the Lord.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.100]   Are you willing?
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:20.200]   Let's just take a moment to pray and seek the Lord.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.700]   What has he entrusted us?
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.000]   (soft music)
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:38.700]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this message.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.100]   Paul's charge to Timothy,
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.600]   to guard his spiritual gifts.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.000]   Not be fearful.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.600]   To guard the truth.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.700]   To commit himself to what he's been entrusted with.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.900]   I pray that also for us.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.800]   That the things you've blessed us with,
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.400]   it wouldn't just stay with us,
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.100]   but that we would pass it on to those around us.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:17.100]   You bless us so that we could bless others.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.200]   Could bless others.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.700]   And they could know the truth.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.600]   And they can know the light and life of Christ.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   Bless us Lord.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.400]   Guide us by your Holy Spirit.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.800]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.700]   Amen.
