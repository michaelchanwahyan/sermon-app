1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Alright, how's everybody tonight?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Excellent.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,840
 Are you guys disgusted with life?

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,640
 This is apparently the topic that's been assigned to me.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,080
 Today's topic is disgusted with life, Ezekiel chapter 2.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,400
 And we've been talking about several main themes that sort of appear within this book.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,640
 The first is vanity.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,920
 Pastor Michelle talked about that, this word, habal.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,960
 It's like she gave us this metaphor, we're just grasping for something, we're just grasping

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,080
 for air.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,780
 And there's nothing, it's futile, it's lacking substance, pointlets.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,400
 It's like the wind or vapor.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,980
 And then Pastor John last week continued and explained more to us, right?

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,180
 That nothing seems to change.

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,640
 This life, what's good about it?

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,220
 Nothing seems to change.

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,480
 Nothing satisfies.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,740
 Nothing is new under the sun.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,380
 Everything, nothing is understood.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,380
 There's vanity, it's pointless.

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,220
 There's no meaning.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,320
 And then this concept of nothing new under the sun.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,740
 This preacher, it's going through a discussion on how do I find meaning in life, in this

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,380
 life on earth.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,460
 That's what it means.

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,980
 Nothing new under the sun.

27
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,340
 And he continues in chapter 2 and he talks about several things that we're gonna talk

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,340
 about tonight.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,220
 And the first is pleasure is meaningless.

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,940
 Wisdom is meaningless.

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,800
 And work is meaningless.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,780
 And Pastor, not Pastor, our administrator, Bonnie read to us.

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,640
 Yeah, future, future.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 There's meaning in this world.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
 Bonnie read to us the scripture.

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,780
 And the first thing that the preacher talks about is behold, he goes through laughter.

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,780
 It's mad.

38
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,720
 Pleasure, what use is it?

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,820
 He searched for how to fill his heart with wine, right?

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,240
 And how, you know, he even tried foolishness, right?

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
 All these things.

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,880
 He tried experiences.

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,960
 He wanted to experience things in life.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,460
 I work with a lot of young people, right?

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,460
 And these young people, they grow up and they want to experience life, right?

46
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,060
 They want to do the fun things.

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,240
 They want to do the maybe not so good things.

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,920
 They've all been there.

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,680
 They want to experience life.

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,760
 They want to experience pleasure, laughter, wine.

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,240
 This preacher talks about wine, maybe drunkenness.

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,680
 He wants to experience it.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
 And then foolishness.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,320
 He even tries foolishness.

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,040
 And I also really like experiences, especially sporting experiences.

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,320
 And this next picture, some of you might be in this picture, next picture after that.

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,340
 I was visiting UK before all this COVID stuff was happening.

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,480
 And I went to a Manchester United game.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,280
 And then after that, I met up with Pastor John and we went to another game.

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,980
 And I was like, wow, this is such a great experiences.

61
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,720
 And on the way, we did some work.

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,620
 You know, we met up with some students.

63
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,160
 We had some tea.

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,760
 We had such a great experience.

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
 You know, Pastor John took me to this game.

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,520
 It was a great experience.

68
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,080
 But what do I have at the end of it?

69
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,920
 What do I have at the end of it?

70
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
 My team lost Manchester United.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
 They lost.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,240
 I spent all this money to sit front row.

73
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,200
 Why are you cheering?

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,860
 We should be in the Chinese congregation.

75
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:19,140
 My team, I spent all this money to sit behind, not beside, behind the goalie, you know, front

76
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,540
 row.

77
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,140
 And my team lost.

78
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,860
 And there was, you know, the opposing team and they, you know, sort of fence off the

79
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,080
 opposing team and the home team.

80
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,220
 And the opposing team was like rattling the gate and everything and things were going

81
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
 crazy.

82
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,720
 You know, you know, Jesus was going to come soon, you know, like at that game, like it

83
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,500
 was, it was going to go bananas.

84
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,380
 My team lost.

85
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,820
 And then me and Pastor John went to this game.

86
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
 Fantastic time.

87
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,060
 What do we have to show for it?

88
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,700
 Maybe a photo of our great experience.

89
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,180
 Vanity.

90
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,900
 Pointless.

91
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,580
 That's what this preacher is saying.

92
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,120
 Experiences, they only last for a moment.

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:10,180
 He continues this preacher and says that he's done great works, great, great, amazing houses,

94
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,460
 gardens, fruit trees, pools, forests.

95
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,460
 Wow.

96
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
 Amazing.

97
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,900
 Can you imagine all these things?

98
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,620
 This is like Sim City, right?

99
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,180
 Just like maybe he was playing Sim City.

100
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,140
 You guys remember that game Sim City where you create a city, roller coasters, and maybe

101
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,500
 he was doing this game.

102
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,620
 But he also says that this is vanity.

103
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,740
 Accomplishments don't satisfy.

104
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,140
 Accomplishments don't satisfy.

105
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,780
 Back in Toronto, I competed for many years in this race.

106
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,440
 Have you guys heard of Amazing Race before?

107
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,140
 This is sort of called like a, within the city, it's called City Chase.

108
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,860
 And for many years, we competed.

109
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,580
 And for like the first couple years, we competed and we only came like third or fourth.

110
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,460
 And then we started finding the strategy of how to win.

111
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,860
 And we came in first like many years.

112
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,180
 And when I achieved that, I still remember, you know, my friend posted.

113
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:25,020
 He was like, "At last, all this hard work is worthwhile."

114
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,300
 And I remember texting my mom, "Hey, I came first."

115
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,540
 And she's like, "Love you.

116
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,880
 Proud of you."

117
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,620
 And I'm like, "Yeah, great.

118
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,780
 I'm first.

119
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,260
 Now what?

120
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
 Now what?"

121
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,580
 And you get first again and get first again.

122
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,180
 And now what?

123
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,380
 And then your bones and joints are, you know, tired and broken.

124
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,460
 Your body's broken.

125
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,940
 What next?

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,620
 Andre Agassi, eight-time Grand Slam tennis winner.

127
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,540
 He won the Wimbledon here.

128
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,340
 He still had long hair.

129
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,900
 And he says this, "Now that I've won a slam, I know something very few people on earth

130
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,460
 are permitted to know.

131
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,900
 A win doesn't feel as good as a loss feels bad.

132
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,180
 And the good feeling doesn't last long, as long as the bad, not even close.

133
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:33,180
 The goal line moved to achieving the number one ranking and lastly, the 1996 gold medal."

134
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,980
 Yet he never felt like it was enough.

135
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,620
 He says this, "I find it surreal, then perfectly normal.

136
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,820
 I'm struck by how fast the surreal becomes the norm.

137
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,820
 I marvel at how unexciting it is to be famous, how mundane famous people are.

138
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,260
 They're confused, uncertain, insecure, and often hate what they do.

139
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:06,020
 It's something we always hear, like the old adage that money can't buy happiness, but

140
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:12,820
 we never believe it until we see it ourselves."

141
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:21,980
 Andre Agassi won millions of dollars, won eight Grand Slams, but he says, "The good

142
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:29,180
 feeling doesn't last as long as the bad feeling."

143
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:36,900
 The surreal becomes norm, becomes the norm so quickly.

144
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,220
 And this is what our preacher is saying.

145
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,900
 He's tried experience, he's tried pleasure.

146
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,540
 The next thing he tries, well, he buys a lot of male and female slaves.

147
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,260
 He has a lot of possessions, right?

148
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
 And then what does he do?

149
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,540
 He gathers a lot of concubines, right?

150
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:03,180
 He's gathered silver, gold, male servants, possessions, and he's gathered concubines.

151
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,260
 He tries what?

152
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,900
 The next thing he tries to find meaning in life is possessions.

153
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,760
 Possessions.

154
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,300
 What do you guys like to possess?

155
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,140
 What do you guys like to hold?

156
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,420
 Is it football jerseys?

157
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,020
 Is it, you know, shoes, Kobe shoes?

158
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,620
 Is it guitars?

159
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,340
 Is it medical equipment?

160
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,340
 I don't know.

161
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
 I'm just looking at Mel.

162
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,420
 I'm just thinking what she collects.

163
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:43,060
 Medical equipment.

164
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,900
 Possessions don't satisfy.

165
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,740
 Lushly desires don't satisfy.

166
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,620
 We get disappointed in relationships.

167
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,820
 Relationships sometimes don't last.

168
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,980
 Sometimes it's not a happy ever after.

169
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,980
 King Solomon is a great example of this.

170
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,220
 Now the reason why a lot of people think King Solomon wrote this book is because a lot of

171
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,380
 this chapter too, right?

172
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,700
 He's possessed everything.

173
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,900
 He's tried everything, right?

174
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,000
 King Solomon, known for his wisdom.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,740
 He prayed, "God, I'm so young.

176
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,940
 I can't do this job.

177
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,420
 I can't be king.

178
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,660
 God, can you help me?"

179
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660
 And what does God do?

180
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:39,060
 God grants him the wisdom to do the thing that he's called him to do.

181
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,340
 And yet Solomon was also blessed with money.

182
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,620
 Do you know how much money he actually had?

183
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,140
 Let's look at it.

184
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:55,180
 Every year, King Solomon received over 25 tons of gold in addition to taxes paid by

185
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
 merchants.

186
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,340
 That's around 666 talents of gold.

187
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,020
 How much gold is that?

188
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,620
 Is anybody wearing 66 talents of gold?

189
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
 No?

190
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
 Nobody?

191
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
 Okay.

192
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,620
 Even the queen, I think, is wearing it right now.

193
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,020
 Okay.

194
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,260
 One talent of gold is worth, next slide, 75 pounds.

195
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,260
 And 75 pounds, okay?

196
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:27,940
 So one talent of gold in today's worth is around $1.6 million.

197
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,040
 $1.6 million.

198
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,620
 So how many talents of gold did he receive yearly?

199
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,340
 666 talents of gold.

200
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,300
 So how much money did he usually make?

201
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,780
 Around 1.1 billion a year.

202
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,020
 Does anybody make $1.1 billion here?

203
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,020
 Is Hank here?

204
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
 Is Hank here?

205
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
 No?

206
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
 Hank's not here?

207
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
 He skipped this talk.

208
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
 Yeah, he didn't want to raise his hand.

209
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
 I'm joking.

210
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
 His wife is here.

211
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
 Okay.

212
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:07,020
 I think it's USD.

213
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,020
 USD.

214
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,580
 1.1 billion.

215
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,140
 And he reigned for how many years?

216
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,580
 Around 40 years.

217
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,500
 Can you imagine how rich that was?

218
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,580
 That's crazy rich.

219
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,080
 What do you do with so much gold?

220
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,860
 You just like sleep in it.

221
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,540
 I think Mayweather has a toilet, you know, that's golden.

222
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,540
 Right?

223
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,220
 Maybe that's what Solomon did, had like golden toilet bowls, right?

224
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,980
 So he had all the money in the world.

225
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,940
 He had all the wisdom in the world.

226
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,460
 And because of that, he was so famous, people came to visit him.

227
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,180
 "Oh, I want to see Solomon, you know, perform."

228
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,220
 You know, like it was like a wisdom show.

229
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,340
 It was not a magic show.

230
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,700
 It was a wisdom show.

231
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
 Right?

232
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,660
 In addition to that, what did he try?

233
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,180
 He tried relationships.

234
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,540
 Oh, did he try relationships.

235
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:05,100
 Anybody have 700 wives and 300 concubines here?

236
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,020
 No, once enough, Pastor John says.

237
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,540
 700 wives and 300 concubines.

238
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,660
 Man, those were busy nights, huh?

239
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
 Very busy nights.

240
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,540
 How do you set up a schedule, you know?

241
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,140
 We have enough problems with our preaching schedule.

242
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,740
 How do you set a schedule like this?

243
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,300
 Anyways, all right.

244
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,060
 Solomon O'Solomon.

245
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,740
 And so, let's see what the preacher says here.

246
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,060
 So he sort of concludes here, this first part of his talk.

247
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,620
 "So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem.

248
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:52,960
 Also my wisdom remained with me and whatever my eyes desired, I did not keep from them.

249
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,220
 I kept from my heart no pleasure.

250
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,020
 My heart found pleasure in all my toil and this was my reward for all my toil.

251
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:09,820
 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil or the work that I had expended

252
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,180
 on doing it and behold, all was vanity.

253
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,820
 A striving after the wind.

254
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,860
 There was nothing to be gained under the sun."

255
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:31,660
 Man, he tried so hard to find meaning in life, in experiences, in pleasure, in possessions,

256
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,420
 in relationships, in fame, in all those fleshly desires.

257
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:43,700
 And at the end of it, he considered, imagine himself sitting at the beach, looking at the

258
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,460
 horizon.

259
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,300
 What have I done?

260
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,820
 And he's like, "I've done nothing.

261
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,300
 Nothing."

262
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,780
 Jim Carrey, one of my favorite actors, he says this, "I think everybody should get rich

263
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:09,260
 and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.

264
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,420
 That it's not the answer."

265
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,620
 So he tried pleasure.

266
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,460
 He tried pleasure.

267
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,860
 What have you tried to find the meaning of life in?

268
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,940
 What kind of pleasure?

269
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,140
 Is it experiences?

270
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,100
 Is it accomplishments?

271
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,220
 Is it possessions?

272
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,260
 Is it fleshly desires?

273
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,920
 Where has it led you?

274
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:44,400
 After an endless chasing, like endless chasing for the next iPhone.

275
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,640
 You get it.

276
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,600
 And then it's like, "Oh, it's nice."

277
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
 For a week.

278
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
 And then it's like, "When's the next one coming out?"

279
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,120
 And then you spend another, how much is it now?

280
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
 9,000?

281
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
 10,000?

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,680
 If you get pro or something?

283
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,040
 Yeah, have fun.

284
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,960
 The second reason why he's disgusted with life, he says wisdom is meaningless.

285
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,080
 Wisdom is meaningless.

286
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
 Let's continue to read.

287
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,120
 So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and fully or foolishness.

288
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,480
 For what can a man do who comes after the king?

289
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,860
 Only what has already been done.

290
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,480
 Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in fully.

291
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,360
 As there is more gain in light than in darkness.

292
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,840
 The wise person has his eyes in his head.

293
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,080
 But a fool walks in darkness.

294
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,240
 Yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.

295
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,840
 Then I said in my heart, "What happens to the fool will also happen to me also."

296
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,840
 Why then have I been so very wise?

297
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,940
 So I said in my heart that all this is also vanity.

298
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:09,200
 For of the wise, as of the fool, there is no enduring remembrance.

299
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:18,200
 Seeing that in the days to come, all will have been long forgotten.

300
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,160
 So the preacher continues and says, he tries wisdom.

301
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,680
 And he's thinking about, yeah, wisdom, it's good.

302
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,760
 I live a wise life.

303
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,500
 And he says, oh, it's good, because the wise, they have their eyes and their heads.

304
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,220
 The fools, they're sort of blind.

305
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,740
 They don't know where they're walking.

306
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,340
 Have you guys been hiking before or been on vacation?

307
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:48,480
 And somebody has led this trip or this hike, and they have no idea where they're going.

308
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,920
 Who enjoys it?

309
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,580
 Who enjoys that sense of adventure?

310
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,620
 Anybody enjoy it?

311
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,140
 No, you feel like you have no idea.

312
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,940
 You feel like you've lost your sense of purpose.

313
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,100
 You feel like you're lost.

314
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,460
 This is what Solomon is saying.

315
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,940
 The wise, they could see.

316
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,500
 They can know exactly where they're going.

317
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,700
 The fools, they're just blindly bumping into things.

318
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,780
 They don't know where they're going.

319
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,100
 But at the end of it all, what happens to both of them?

320
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,580
 Both of them have the same result.

321
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,100
 Death makes life meaningless.

322
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,540
 Both have the same fate.

323
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,900
 Both will not be remembered long.

324
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,380
 And so he's like, wisdom.

325
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,460
 I think I prefer wisdom over foolishness.

326
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,300
 But at the end of the day, we have the same fate.

327
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,500
 And that's what he says makes it meaningless.

328
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,980
 Who are some people you remember in history?

329
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
 Name some out.

330
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,540
 Some people you remember in history.

331
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,140
 Alexander the Great.

332
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,180
 Colby Bryan.

333
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,460
 Who else?

334
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,220
 Abraham Lincoln.

335
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,620
 Winston Churchill.

336
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,180
 All these people are great.

337
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,660
 They're remembered for their basketball playing, their conquering, their leadership.

338
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:34,060
 But yet there's all these other people that were fools or very evil, and yet we still

339
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,580
 remember their names as well.

340
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:45,420
 And so this is why the preacher says wisdom is meaningless.

341
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,460
 The great people, the good people, they die.

342
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,460
 The evil, the dumb people, they also die.

343
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,580
 How long we remember their name, who knows?

344
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,260
 Who knows?

345
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,300
 Pleasure is meaningless.

346
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,540
 Wisdom is meaningless.

347
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,660
 The third thing he talks about is work.

348
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,300
 Who loves their work?

349
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,460
 I know Joseph loves their work, his work.

350
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,580
 Joseph loves his work.

351
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,700
 Michelle loves his work.

352
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
 What do you do, sir?

353
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,300
 I'm a jewelry designer.

354
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,180
 Jewelry designer, very good.

355
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,220
 He loves his work.

356
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,020
 Let's see what the preacher says about work.

357
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,420
 I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the

358
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,100
 man who will come after me.

359
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,300
 And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool, yet he will be the master of all of

360
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,300
 which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun.

361
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,860
 This also is vanity.

362
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,860
 What's the point when I work so hard, I design all that jewelry, I design all those interior

363
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:07,700
 buildings, when I build into all these people at church, what's the point?

364
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:15,060
 All this work, all this money that I've saved, when it just goes to the person after me.

365
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:23,620
 And who knows whether the person after me will be a fool or a wise person.

366
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,640
 You don't know what they're going to do with their money.

367
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,740
 What is the best biblical example of this?

368
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,940
 What's the best biblical example of this?

369
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,860
 The prodigal son.

370
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,260
 The prodigal son, very disrespectfully, when his dad was still alive, was like, "Give me

371
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,500
 my inheritance.

372
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,620
 Give me my inheritance.

373
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,700
 Give me a third of all you own."

374
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,420
 Because he was the younger son, the elder son got two thirds, double portion, if you

375
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,800
 know the Old Testament.

376
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 And what does he do?

377
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,840
 He's like, "Yeah, I'm going to invest it in Bitcoin."

378
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,160
 And then it just plummets.

379
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,360
 And then he wastes it on wild living.

380
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,400
 Woo, you know?

381
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,600
 And then what happens?

382
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
 He's broke.

383
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
 Right?

384
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,160
 Bitcoin fell down and all his money he spent doing woo, just took all his money.

385
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,320
 And he was left with the pigs.

386
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
 Right?

387
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,120
 He was just like, "Hey, pal, how you doing?"

388
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,760
 He had some pets.

389
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,720
 And that's when he realized, "I got to go back to my father.

390
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
 He still can hire me to be his servant."

391
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,960
 Right?

392
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,240
 And that's what the preacher is saying.

393
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:54,960
 What's the point of storing up all this money when you don't know who it's going to go to?

394
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,720
 And whether this person could be your children would be wise or fools.

395
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 Right?

396
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,000
 And so he also says this, "Work is grief and pain.

397
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,080
 Even at night, our minds do not rest."

398
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,840
 Work is vanity.

399
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,000
 Because even when we're asleep, we can't even sleep.

400
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,360
 We're just constantly working.

401
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880
 We're constantly thinking about work.

402
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,400
 Joseph loves to think about work.

403
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,800
 That's how he gets to sleep.

404
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 He told me.

405
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,320
 I'm not putting words in his mouth.

406
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,760
 But work, the preacher says, "Work is pain and grief because we can't rest.

407
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,000
 We're constantly thinking about it."

408
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,760
 And so that's why he's disgusted with life.

409
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,920
 Well, he doesn't say disgusted.

410
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,280
 He says vanity and meaningless.

411
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,000
 You just put a fancy title to catch your attention.

412
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,520
 He's disgusted with life because pleasure is meaningless.

413
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,040
 He's tried everything.

414
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,940
 Everything he set his eyes on, he's tried.

415
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,920
 Everything his heart has wanted, he's tried it.

416
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,960
 But at the end of the day, it's nothing.

417
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,760
 He's tried wisdom, the wise way of living.

418
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,200
 But at the end, we all have the same fate.

419
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,360
 What's the point?

420
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,640
 He's tried work.

421
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,000
 But what's the point of work and storing up treasures when you don't know where this treasure

422
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,680
 is going to go?

423
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,400
 He makes it seem as if life, there's no point.

424
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,040
 We should all just give up right now.

425
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,460
 And that's how he sets us up.

426
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,600
 He sets it up where everything is doom and gloom.

427
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,560
 He ends with a conclusion.

428
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,680
 Let's read this conclusion together.

429
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
 Let's read it.

430
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,520
 Therefore, ready, set, go.

431
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,040
 Therefore is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment

432
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,920
 in his toil.

433
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,520
 This also I saw from the hand of God.

434
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,680
 For apart from him, who can eat and who can have enjoyment?

435
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,600
 For the one who pleases him, God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy.

436
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,920
 But to the sinner, he has given the business of gathering and collecting only to give to

437
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,240
 the one who pleases God.

438
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,560
 This also is vanity and a striving after the wind.

439
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,280
 So he's been for how many chapters?

440
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,040
 24 chapters.

441
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,640
 Kobe Bryant time, right?

442
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,120
 For 24 chapters, he's been talking about life is meaningless.

443
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:51,520
 And then he, at the end, he throws in three verses to try and catch you off guard.

444
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,360
 And this is what he says.

445
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,280
 It's interesting because the first thing we notice is that he believes in God.

446
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,560
 He believes in God.

447
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,200
 And what does he believe about God?

448
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:13,880
 He believes that God has given us this ability to eat and drink and have satisfaction.

449
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,560
 He has given this ability to us.

450
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,080
 It's not random.

451
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,120
 It's not just randomness.

452
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
 There was a design.

453
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,600
 There was a purpose.

454
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,440
 Somebody allowed it to happen.

455
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,960
 There was an intelligent designer that allowed this to happen.

456
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,840
 And so the first thing he says, how to make the most of your life, my first point is to

457
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:52,360
 recognize that God has given us the ability to eat and drink and find satisfaction in

458
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,000
 our work.

459
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,040
 And I wanna invite Winnie and Ricky to come up and share about how they have experienced

460
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:09,640
 God and how God has given them the ability to eat and drink and find satisfaction.

461
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,640
 Let's give them a hand.

462
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,160
 - Hi.

463
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,840
 So we are here to share about how good it is to be able to eat and drink.

464
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,000
 And we like eating, don't we?

465
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 We like eating.

466
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,720
 And just about two months ago, we actually went to a staycation, staying in this hotel

467
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
 in May.

468
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,560
 And throughout the two days in the hotel, we did nothing, just eating, eating, and eating.

469
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,920
 Yeah, it's so enjoyable.

470
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,160
 And God allowed us to do that.

471
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,240
 And it's amazing because at that time, we didn't know that something is happening.

472
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,760
 We have no idea.

473
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,680
 And we do know that very soon, we are going to have another staycation, just a different

474
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
 type of staycation.

475
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,240
 So it all happened on the 26th of June.

476
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,640
 It was a Sunday evening.

477
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,840
 Our family had a family dinner with Tony's family, and we totally enjoyed it.

478
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,440
 It was late in the night when we partied.

479
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,120
 And on the way to the car park, I was walking behind him.

480
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,960
 And when I looked at him, he walked as if he's pretty tired.

481
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,520
 He's as if he wasn't lifting his left leg up properly.

482
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,480
 So we asked him, and he said, "I have no problem.

483
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,040
 I'm fine."

484
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,680
 So we didn't let him drive.

485
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,400
 Our son Chester drove home.

486
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,640
 But when we arrived at home, he actually threw up, right?

487
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
 He threw up a little bit.

488
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
 And then what did he say?

489
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,680
 He said, "Oh, I'm having travel sickness because I'm used to be the driver.

490
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,400
 I'm not used to sitting at the back."

491
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,040
 So he was complaining about the driving skills of his son.

492
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
 So we brushed it aside.

493
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,640
 We brushed it aside, and we went home.

494
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,480
 And of course, I was the first one to grab the bathroom.

495
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
 I took a bath.

496
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,920
 I changed into my pajamas, and I sat there.

497
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,840
 It was like 10 to 15 minutes before the clock strikes 12, and that would be my serbath Monday.

498
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,640
 And I'm totally relaxed, enjoying my time there, winding down.

499
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,720
 And then he went into the bathroom to take a bath.

500
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,880
 And out of the blue, I got this idea in my head, popped him up suddenly, and I said,

501
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,320
 "I should take him to the hospital for a checkup."

502
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,200
 And strange enough, as lazy as I am, I got up onto my feet.

503
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,720
 I get myself changed even before he finished his bath.

504
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,400
 And when he came out from the bathroom, I said, "I'm taking you to the hospital for

505
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
 a check now."

506
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
 And he said, "Why?

507
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
 I have no problem."

508
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,640
 So, we went to the hospital.

509
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,500
 It was like 10 minutes past midnight.

510
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,400
 We were in the private hospital, and I explained my concern.

511
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,160
 And the doctor checked on him, examined him, and the doctor said, "Whoa, he's fine.

512
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,440
 He has no problem."

513
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:15,200
 But I cannot preclude that he might have had a minor stroke earlier on when he threw up.

514
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:23,640
 So, if you are keen to have a brain scan, because I asked for a brain scan, yeah, you

515
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,000
 can do it, but it's not worth doing it right now.

516
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 You can wait till the morning.

517
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 It's not urgent.

518
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,520
 He might have recovered by himself already, this minor stroke, because he's not perfectly

519
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
 okay.

520
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,520
 But it's good to find out whether he has had a minor stroke.

521
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
 So he said, "Okay, I'm going home."

522
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,760
 I said, "No, you're not going home.

523
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
 You're staying here in the hospital.

524
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,440
 And tomorrow morning, you're going to get a scan."

525
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,000
 So in the morning, the nurses asked him, "Why are you hospitalized, and what did you tell

526
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 them?"

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,200
 And I told her that my family was watching queer behavior, queer manner.

528
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,280
 So the nurse said, "I don't think so.

529
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
 You are all okay.

530
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,520
 You are normal.

531
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,680
 So I don't understand why you are here."

532
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,120
 Yeah, the nurse said he's all right.

533
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,080
 And then a neurologist came, actually a specialist came, and examined all over again.

534
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,920
 And he also considered that he's pretty normal, absolutely okay.

535
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,440
 So I was pressing and pressing for a brain scan.

536
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,740
 But since he's a normal patient, his scanning was kept being deferred.

537
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,400
 And it wasn't until 21 minutes past six, I think, in the evening, that he started to

538
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,480
 go into that room for a scan.

539
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,240
 And because I kept pressing to see the doctor, so the doctor came up to see me, it was like

540
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,880
 6.40.

541
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,240
 He was still in the room.

542
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,440
 MRI report wasn't out yet, but the doctor invited me to go and sit in front of a computer

543
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,120
 and look at the scan real time.

544
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,940
 And I saw this image.

545
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,160
 So can you interpret that?

546
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:05,480
 Actually, all that gray band over that little element, instead of a walnut in the skull,

547
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,560
 were blood.

548
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,960
 On the right, it was two, according to the report afterwards, on the right, the belt

549
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,660
 measures 2.44 cm.

550
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,240
 On the left, the belt measures 1.41 cm.

551
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,040
 And it's like a helmet all around his head.

552
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,900
 And if you look at the front scan, actually, the blood went all down to the eyebrow.

553
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:37,280
 So his brain was like being filled up by blood, taking up at least 25 to 30% of the space

554
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,040
 of his original size.

555
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,280
 So that was what happened.

556
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,160
 I feel really sorry for this poor neurologist, because in the morning, on a Monday morning,

557
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,840
 he went into the hospital, he ran into this patient who is perfectly normal and okay.

558
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,880
 And then he has a paranoid wife who kept pressing for an MRI scan.

559
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,480
 This wife is paranoid.

560
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,920
 But by the evening, when she looked at this scan, she didn't even raise her eyebrow.

561
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,880
 She said, "Oh, there's a lot of blood."

562
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
 And she's insanely calm.

563
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,760
 So he decided to do something to help me realize the significance of the situation.

564
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,880
 And he said, "Does he have any other family members?"

565
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
 "Yeah."

566
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
 He got two sons.

567
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
 "Are they in Hong Kong?"

568
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
 "Yeah."

569
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
 "Should I ask them to come over?"

570
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
 "Of course."

571
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,480
 Okay, rush our sons over.

572
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,880
 That's his instruction that he need an operation.

573
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,400
 So I think it was around seven, he came up back to the ward.

574
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,280
 And he looked a little bit perplexed.

575
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,320
 "Got blood in my brain?

576
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
 A lot?"

577
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,400
 Yeah, a lot.

578
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:50,840
 And so I sent the photo over to my sons, because the MRI report is actually not yet even printed.

579
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,280
 I just took a picture, a photo from the screen monitor.

580
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,240
 And my son Ryan actually sent it over to his doctor friends.

581
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,160
 And the doctor friends says, "Every minute counts.

582
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
 Every minute counts.

583
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,840
 This hospital is so slow.

584
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,440
 You immediately rush him over to casualty in a public hospital and get the surgery done

585
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,200
 immediately to remove the blood."

586
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,840
 And I said, "Son, hold on.

587
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,800
 While we're waiting for the papers to be discharged, let me make a call."

588
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,480
 So I called our friend who is the parent of Chester, our eldest son, one of his best friends

589
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
 in school.

590
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,520
 And we called that parent.

591
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,800
 And we just made it in time, because he was a professor, head of a heart center in Bat

592
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,160
 Tibbs Hospital.

593
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,280
 He was about to go into operation theater himself.

594
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,720
 We just catch him in time.

595
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
 So he immediately...

596
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
 - Postponed it.

597
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
 - Yeah.

598
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,760
 He just make all the arrangements.

599
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,840
 In 20 minutes, he gave me a call.

600
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
 He has everything.

601
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,200
 Everything is done.

602
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,960
 So it's so smooth.

603
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
 It's so smooth.

604
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
 And there's no worries.

605
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:01,320
 Because if he has gone into the theater, then we will be running around asking for surgeons

606
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,000
 and so on and so forth.

607
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,160
 So anyway, that's what happened that night in around, I think, 8 o'clock or so, a little

608
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
 bit past 8.

609
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
 - 8 o'clock, okay.

610
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,880
 - The director of ICU of Bat Tibbs Hospital rushed over.

611
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:26,080
 And he was here to escort him on an ambulance to the hospital on the current site for surgery.

612
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,320
 And when he arrived, we as a family was actually standing around the bed, chatting.

613
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,800
 And he practically jumped.

614
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,320
 Maybe not as Bonnie.

615
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
 He actually...

616
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,840
 It made him jump.

617
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,600
 He totally jumped up and said, "Oh my goodness, this is a patient?

618
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,760
 You really scared me.

619
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,000
 Why are you not lying on the bed?

620
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,400
 This is very dangerous.

621
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
 This is something very dangerous to do.

622
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,240
 Please, please, please, immediately get back onto the bed and lie down, not sit down.

623
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,960
 And from this moment onward, you're not to lay your feet onto the ground again.

624
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,400
 And even when the ambulance come, we're going to transfer you through a stretcher.

625
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,360
 You should not move at all," he said.

626
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,840
 You should not move at all.

627
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:14,200
 But, well, he has been moving around for a long time, okay?

628
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
 With all those blood in his head.

629
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,320
 And then he set up the things and he measured the blood pressure.

630
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,320
 Let's check on his memory, see whether he's okay.

631
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,200
 I think it's about more than...

632
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
 Greater than 180.

633
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
 His blood pressure is very high.

634
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
 Blood pressure was over 180.

635
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
 Yeah, but I don't feel any dizziness.

636
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
 I feel okay.

637
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
 There is no numbness.

638
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
 There is no headache.

639
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
 Everything is normal.

640
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
 Any headache?

641
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
 No headache.

642
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
 Any dizziness?

643
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
 Anything numb?

644
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
 No.

645
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
 He is very normal.

646
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:51,920
 So just think of anyone with a blood pressure of over 180, yeah, and he's still normal.

647
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,360
 And the doctor explained that the high blood pressure was result because of super high

648
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,960
 pressure inside the skull because of all those blood.

649
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:07,360
 Anyway, so we got onto the ambulance and let's check on his memory again.

650
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,320
 Who did the most talking on the ambulance?

651
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,640
 On the journey from Singapore Hospital to the Petro-Circuital, the consultant of the

652
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:23,240
 ICU of Petro-Circuital just together with me in the ambulance, I talked with him over

653
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
 the...

654
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,720
 On another journey and I do all the...

655
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,080
 I do most of the talking.

656
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
 He was...

657
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
 He could not stop talking.

658
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,360
 He was talking and talking, chatting and chatting throughout.

659
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
 With the doctor.

660
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,680
 And he answered phones and texted and...

661
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,520
 Because a lot of people, Sister and Brothers in Church, are horrified at the news and people

662
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
 are asking me, "Is this alert?

663
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
 Is this conscious?"

664
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,680
 It's not just alert and conscious, it was talking and talking.

665
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,160
 And he was very jolly, actually.

666
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,400
 So we arrived at the hospital, get everything checked and...

667
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,040
 Oh, yeah.

668
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,440
 The doctor actually asked what's the cause of that blood, the bleeding.

669
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,360
 And he asked him, "Have you hit your head in the past week?"

670
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,240
 We said, "No, definitely not."

671
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,440
 "How about in the past two or three weeks?"

672
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,200
 We said, "No, definitely not."

673
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,520
 He said, "No, it's impossible.

674
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,920
 There must be caused by some hitting on the head."

675
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,320
 And eventually we realised it was actually two long months ago, not two to three weeks

676
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
 ago.

677
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
 Two months ago, yeah.

678
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,520
 What happened on the 29th of April?

679
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
 Yeah.

680
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:34,040
 In the afternoon, I drove my car out of the car park of the PP, particular place.

681
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,920
 And I collided with the tail of the Norway.

682
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,660
 The Norway is coming down, I'm waking up.

683
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:47,400
 So it is quite lucky for me, or thanks God, we don't have head-to-head condition.

684
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,520
 Otherwise, the consequences cannot be imagined.

685
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,900
 But the airbags, both airbags actually popped out.

686
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,360
 So the force was strong.

687
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,720
 But he said he's not hurt.

688
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,840
 And we did our part.

689
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,040
 We forced him to go to the hospital for a checkup.

690
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,960
 And the hospital checked him over.

691
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,880
 And the hospital released him and said he is fine.

692
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,740
 And he's actually fine.

693
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:20,720
 If every minute counts, I counted roughly, it was about 85,200 minutes has passed.

694
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,880
 And he was running around carrying those blood in his brain.

695
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,520
 And we went to a staycation, eating and eating and drinking, allowed by God, enjoying life.

696
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,880
 He did a lot of things those two weeks.

697
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,880
 And there were, according to the doctor, there were bleeding on various locations throughout

698
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
 those two months.

699
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:50,200
 Anyway, so the next photo I want to show you is the photo we took just the very moment

700
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,480
 before he went into the surgery room.

701
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,680
 So we were allowed to go into the ICU to see him two by two.

702
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,200
 So that's why we took pictures two by two.

703
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,840
 And I lay down on him and prayed for him.

704
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:09,160
 And then I hope you agree with me that do you see panic in our eyes?

705
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,600
 Do you see worries in our eyes?

706
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
 We are actually smiling.

707
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,400
 And when I show this photo to one of the sister in my clan, she actually said, it looked more

708
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,360
 like you're going into a delivery room about to deliver a baby.

709
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,040
 I praised the Lord for giving us that supernatural peace.

710
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,400
 It's absolutely supernatural peace.

711
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,000
 Are you afraid at that moment?

712
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,320
 I wasn't afraid.

713
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,280
 And then he went into the operation theatre.

714
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,480
 We went downstairs to wait for the surgery to be done.

715
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,000
 A lot of loving brothers and sisters did not sleep that night lifting us up in prayers

716
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,320
 because the surgery was started like 15 minutes past midnight.

717
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,400
 And Bella actually called me and then she said, how come you sounded a lot calmer than

718
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
 I do?

719
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,640
 So because we are not afraid, we really are not afraid.

720
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,160
 Why am I not afraid?

721
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,120
 When I look at that much blood in the brain, I know that it was God who has sustained him

722
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,480
 over the past two months.

723
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,640
 If God has sustained him over the past two months, why should he not sustain him on this

724
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
 day?

725
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
 Why?

726
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,120
 I cannot think of a reason why.

727
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,560
 And if God is for us, who can be against us?

728
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,040
 Yeah, thanks.

729
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,960
 I feel so thankful for the Lord, not just for everything going so smooth, also for the

730
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,240
 supernatural peace that we are experiencing.

731
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,760
 Okay, question.

732
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,880
 Why did God allow us to wait that long for this scan?

733
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,240
 We waited for 18 hours before the scan was done.

734
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,880
 Guess what?

735
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,660
 Next slide, please.

736
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,720
 On that very Monday, my son was taking his pre-wedding photo on the beach with the whole

737
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,980
 crew.

738
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,240
 So he kept testing us and asking for results of the scan, and he said he didn't even start

739
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,900
 to do his scan.

740
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,380
 And the scan was only done by the time they finished the shooting.

741
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,900
 All things work for good for those who love God.

742
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,420
 This really amazing grace, we really thank God.

743
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,700
 All the timing, everything were in God's hand.

744
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
 He's sovereign.

745
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,220
 He's totally sovereign, so praise the Lord.

746
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:36,340
 And the last photo I want to show you is the photo we took as we left the hospital five

747
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
 days after the surgery.

748
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,540
 Actually, oh, can I ask you a question?

749
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:45,060
 Do you still remember what time did you send out your first text message after the surgery?

750
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:52,140
 When I was sent out from the surgery theater, I sent out my first message to my family.

751
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,220
 It is about half past seven in the morning.

752
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,940
 We finished this operation three in the, 3 a.m., and four and a half hours later, this

753
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,660
 guy is texting his family.

754
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,860
 And in the morning, in less than 12 hours, he's eating and drinking again.

755
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,140
 He's eating and drinking in the hospital again.

756
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,900
 And he could get off his bed, there's any brain damage on you.

757
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,980
 Actually, the doctor explained that the danger of his case was that a lot of people with

758
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,380
 that much blood in their brain would have passed out, and then they never woke up again,

759
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,180
 they would just pass away.

760
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,020
 And another possibility was that they would probably, even after surgery, they could have

761
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,980
 brain damage because the brain stem is being pressed so much.

762
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,580
 But this did not happen to us.

763
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:43,620
 And so we took a selfie as we left the hospital because my son said it really felt like a

764
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,620
 staycation.

765
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:51,380
 We have great family time over the week, a lot of family time, and I continue to water

766
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,740
 my plants during that week.

767
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,660
 I bake some scones, I make tea.

768
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,660
 People ask me whether it's a roller coaster week for me, I would say no.

769
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:10,260
 For me, I think it's a joyful week because God has revealed himself to us in our family.

770
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,180
 And I think that something great, something exciting is coming our way.

771
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,820
 I praise the Lord for that.

772
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,100
 And what do you have to say about this vacation?

773
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:28,380
 Yes, I would like to say that it's my feeling that nothing should be taken for granted.

774
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,540
 Nothing should be taken for granted.

775
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,660
 So we have to praise God.

776
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:41,820
 And I also like to praise God for his mercy and protection for me and for my family.

777
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:48,380
 And I also like to thank the church members who put me in their prayers.

778
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:55,580
 I know that when I was receiving the surgery in the early morning, some of the church members

779
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,100
 would not sleep.

780
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,700
 They say prayers for me.

781
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,700
 A lot of people were asleep.

782
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:06,540
 A lot of people just praying for me until my surgery is over.

783
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,060
 So here, I'd like to make my friends, I'd like to give my big thanks to them.

784
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,300
 We felt very much loved by this community.

785
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:22,900
 And while he was in the operation theater, while I was praying, some words kept popping

786
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,900
 up in my prayer.

787
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,820
 And I felt that the operation theater was filled with God's glory.

788
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:35,580
 And I think this thing that happened to our family is actually filled, it's actually all

789
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,500
 of us with his grace and his power and everything.

790
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,060
 So I'm very excited.

791
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:47,220
 I thank God that he provides, he sustains.

792
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,860
 Eating and drinking should not be taken for granted.

793
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,180
 And eating and drinking in the presence of the Lord is something so joyful.

794
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,460
 It was a joyful week for us, actually.

795
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,460
 Praise the Lord.

796
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,940
 To him be the glory.

797
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,940
 - Praise the Lord.

798
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,220
 What an amazing testimony of just how God has been working.

799
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:18,380
 And yes, indeed, he allows us to eat and to drink and to enjoy the things in life.

800
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:25,580
 And the second thing that the preacher talks about is that God allows us to find contentment

801
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,140
 in our work and in pleasures.

802
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:40,580
 And I just want us to stand, I just want us to be reminded of three things.

803
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,060
 And the first thing is that God is the one that provides for us.

804
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,180
 He provides life for us.

805
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,900
 The air we breathe, every moment that we have.

806
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:57,460
 And not only does he provide those, he provides life, he sustains our life.

807
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,540
 He sustained Ricky's life.

808
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,940
 He's sustaining our breath right now.

809
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,260
 Jesus is the author and sustainer of our life.

810
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:13,540
 And the last thing that the preacher talks about is that he is a God that rewards us.

811
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:17,700
 He rewards those that are his.

812
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:25,740
 If a father can give good gifts to his son, how much greater is our heavenly father who

813
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,360
 will reward us.

814
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,340
 Be not on this earth, but into the next life to come.

815
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,580
 Let us stand and respond in a song called Jesus at the Center of It All.

816
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,160
 (gentle music)
