[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]  Hello, I'm Pastor Johnny. 希望你在家裡有平安,和神保守你。
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]  Hope you're staying safe at home. 希望你在家裡保持安全。
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  Today we're going to talk about "You are adopted". 你是被接受的。
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  You are adopted as God's child. 你是被接受為神的孩子。
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  神領養你,做他的孩子。
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  在這個世界,Orphanism 是一個很大的問題。
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  有一個stat在2015就說,There are 15.1 million children that are orphans. 有一個stat在2015就說,有15.1萬名小孩是被接受的。
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  Orphanism is a big problem. 孤僻是一個很大的問題。
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  15.1 million 是好像Russia那麼大,一個國家那麼大。
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  And fatherlessness, fatherlessness, 在這裡有一個quote,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  Never have so many children grown up without knowing what it means to have a father. 從小到大都沒有知道什麼是有一個父親的意思。
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  Fatherlessness is the most harmful demographic trend of this generation. 父親性是這個世代最嚴重的民族流行。
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  It is the leading cause of declining child and adult well-being in our society. 這是我們社會中的最大原因,是孩子和成長的原因。
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  It is also the engine driving our most urgent social problem. 也是我們社會最緊急的社會問題的引擎。
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  If this trend continues, fatherlessness is likely to change the shape of our society. 如果這個流行繼續下去,父親性將會改變社會的形狀。
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  This is a family researcher from the United States, David Blankenhorn. 這是一位美國的家庭研究員,David Blankenhorn。
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  In the time of Paul, child immorality was a big problem. 在布羅時代,聖經時期,孩子的不道德是一個很大的問題。
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  Maybe the child was disabled. 可能孩子是失去能力了。
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  Maybe the child was a girl. 可能孩子是一個女孩。
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]  Sometimes, the family might have to abandon the child. 有時候,孩子的家庭就可能被丟棄了。
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  In the city of Ephesus, when Paul wrote a letter to Ephesus, 在那裡的城市,布羅寫了一封信給那裡的城市人。
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  There was a problem in the city, called "Death by Exposure". 在那裡的城市,有一個問題叫"死亡被爆炸"。
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  If the family didn't want the child, 如果那些家庭不想要孩子,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  they could have this Roman rule, called "Death by Exposure". 他們可以有這個羅曼法,叫"死亡被爆炸"。
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  Just like that, they threw the child into a garbage area. 就這樣把孩子丟到垃圾的地方。
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  If the sun and heat exposed the child, 如果太陽和熱能曝光了孩子,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  he would die. 他就會死。
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  At that time, Paul told them, 當時,布羅對他們說,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  "You are adopted as his child." 你是他的孩子。
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  In Ephesians chapter 1, he said, 在一書一書,他說,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  "For he has chosen us before him, 因為他選擇了我們在他面前,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  before the creation of the world, 在世界的創造前,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  to be holy and blameless in his sight. 以他的眼中,無罪無罪地存在。
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  In love, he predestined us for adoption 愛,他將我們預定
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  to sonship through Jesus Christ, 子女遷生到基督基督,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  in accordance with his pleasure and will." 以他的喜好和願望。
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  "神係領養你"。
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  那時,那些基督徒是怎樣? 那時,那些基督徒是怎樣?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  看到那麼多不同的孩子, 看到那麼多不同的孩子,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  就這樣被羅曼丟了, right? 就這樣被羅曼丟了,對嗎?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  因為可能disabled了, 因為可能不適合了,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  可能是女孩子,可能是不適合, 因為有小朋友是要錢的,對嗎?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  如果你要錢,可能take away from your social status, 如果你要錢,可能要脫離你的社會的地位,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  就不要了他。 那些基督徒在那個city,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  叫做Ethesis,那又怎樣呢? 叫做Ethesis,那又怎樣呢?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  他看到那些孩子被人abandon了, 他就adopt了他們。
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  adoption是一個很amazing thing, 是兩個parents,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  一個爸爸,一個媽媽, loving family,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  adopted an unwanted child, abandoned child,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  這個picture is a picture of what God has done for us.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  今天我們會看神領養我們, 有三個aspects,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  第一,我們有一個新的家庭, new family,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  第二,是一個新的identity, 第三,是一個新的inheritance,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  第一,我們為甚麼會有一個新的家庭呢?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  第一,是因為是天父initiate,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  God initiated it through Jesus Christ,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  今天我們會讀Galatians 4:4-5
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  及至時候滿足, 神就差遣他的兒子為女子所生,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  且生在律法意下, 要把律法意下的人屬出來,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  叫我們得著兒子的名分。
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  在這裡寫, 神把他的兒子生下為女子,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]  以律法下的兒子, 讓我們可以得著兒子的名分。
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  神把我們的兒子領養為他的孩子,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  第二,我們會看到, 我們的新的family,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  是through Jesus Christ,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  God sent his son, 他差遣主耶穌幫我們,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  去救我們,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  還有我們看到, 我們的新的family,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  是我們united with brothers and sisters,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  這個家庭是有不同的brothers and sisters,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  我們基督徒的brothers and sisters,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  brothers in Christ,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  第一,我們有一個新的家庭,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  第二,我們有一個新的identity,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  之前我們rejected,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  we were rejected because of sin,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  我們有罪,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  有罪我們和神的關係分裂了,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]  that now we are reborn, redeemed,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  and remade a child in Christ,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]  之前我們被罪control我們,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]  we were slaves to sin,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  但現在我們有freedom,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  freedom to serve God,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  去侍奉神,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  serve God and serve righteousness,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]  we are now free to be righteous,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]  在John 1是這樣說,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  凡接待他的,就是信他名的人,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  他就賜他們權並作神的兒女,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  這等人不是從血氣生的,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  不是從情慾生的,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  也不是從仁義生的,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]  乃是從神生的。
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  For those who received him,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  those who believed in his name,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  he gave the right to become children of God,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  children of God,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  如果你相信主耶穌,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  接受了他,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  是你的頭子,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  你可以做他的孩子,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  you are his child.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  第三,我們有一個new inheritance,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  new inheritance,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  在Romans 8說,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  因為凡被神的靈引導的,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  都是神的兒子,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  我們所受的,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  不是奴僕的心,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  仍舊害怕,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  所受的,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  乃是兒子的心,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  因此我們呼叫阿爸父,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  聖靈與我們的心,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  同證我們是神的兒女,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  既是兒女,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  便是後子,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]  就是神的後子,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]  與基督同作後子,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  如果我們和他一同受苦,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]  也必和他一同得榮耀。
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  你所受的靈,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  並不使你成為奴僕,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  讓你活在恐懼中,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  讓你再次生活在恐懼中,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  但是你所受的靈,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  帶給你兒子的育成,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  而我們呼叫阿爸父,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  靈自身與我們的靈,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  證明我們是神的兒女,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  現在如果我們是兒女,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  我們就是後子,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  是神的後子,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  與基督同作後子,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  如果我們一同受苦,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  也必和他一同得榮耀。
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  我們是後子,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  與基督同作後子,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  我們與主耶穌,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  一同得榮耀,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  這個榮耀是什麼呢?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  一個新的天堂,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  一個新的地球,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  主耶穌復活,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  我們有一天也會有,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  一個復活的身體,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]  我們也會復活,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  我們一同得榮耀,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  與天堂的寬廣,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  我們與主耶穌,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  一同分享天堂的未來。
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  哇!
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  我們說了三件事,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  神領養我們,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  有三件新事物,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  一個新的家庭,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  新的家庭,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  一個新的身份,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  新身份,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  新身份,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  還有第三件事,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  新身份。
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]  保羅在他的書,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  《二法所書》,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  說我們是他的孩子,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  問題就是,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  我們是否在演戲,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  像他的孩子,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  我們是否在演戲,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  像他的兒女,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  不是,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  如果我們是他的孩子,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  我們會奉服神,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  我們會改變生命,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]  我們會奉服神,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  我們會模仿耶穌,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  我們會變得像耶穌,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  在第五章,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  保羅叫那些"Ephesians",
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  做什麼?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  "The imitators of God",
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  "The imitators",
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  因為你是他的孩子,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]  你要怎樣?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  要模仿神,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  好像神一樣,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  是不是?
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  第二樣,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  他說"Walk in love",
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  "Walk in love",
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  你要走在愛的方面,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  你也要模仿神的愛,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  還有什麼?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  他說"Walk not as unwise, but as wise",
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  因為你是他的孩子,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  你要聰明,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  要聰明,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  "Do not be drunk on wine,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  which leads to debauchery,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]  but be filled with the Spirit",
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  給聖靈充滿,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  你做他的孩子,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  你沒有給神的聖靈充滿,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  "Be filled with the Spirit of God",
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  我們在華人的文化,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  是很不同的,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  和西方文化,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  是不是?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  這個亞洲文化,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  華人的文化,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]  是很表演性的,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  是不是?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  我知道你們讀書有很多壓力,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  很表演性的,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  爸爸媽媽說,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  為什麼你只有90%,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  為什麼不是100%呢?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  是不是?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  所以令到我們好像要很緊張,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  我們的性,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  我們的表演性,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  我們時時都要保護面子,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  給面子,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]  Hide all your weaknesses,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]  So that people don't look down on you,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  Hide your failures,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  在這個華人的社會,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  是有時很難的,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  是不是?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  是有很多壓力的,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  我們做基督徒,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  有時我們transfer,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  我們的Chinese culture,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  into our faith as well,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  有時我覺得自己要做很多很多的事,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  去侍奉神,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]  然後神才會愛我,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  才會領養我做祂的孩子,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  一個problem with faith and works,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  你是不是好像這樣,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  經常做事,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  希望別人去impress,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  be impressed by you,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  有時我做牧師,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  都會有這樣的struggle,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  是不是?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  如果我傳福音,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  傳到很多人,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  那神就可能很開心,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  會love me more,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  But that's not true,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  There's nothing that I can do,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  that would make God love me more or less,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  God loves me,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  and His love is consistent,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  and my identity needs to be found in Him,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  as His child, as His son,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  我們如果接受了,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  神是愛我們,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  神是領養我們,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  是祂的孩子,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  那我們不用perform,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  我們不用去教會,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  因為我們希望神開心,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  可以讓我們去天堂,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  不是的,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  我們去教會,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  不是去pleased,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  Hopefully God will be pleased with us,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  我們回教會,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  因為我們是worshippers,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  We are worshippers of God,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  We don't come to church to please God,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]  and hopefully He will save us,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  hopefully He will let us into heaven,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  No, we are adopted as His child,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  我們是祂的孩子,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  我們回來教會,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  是去敬拜,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  因為we are worshippers,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  we are worshippers,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  神adopted我們,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  給我們有個freedom,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  去serve 祂,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  We serve Him not because of obligation,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  我們為甚麼去serve呢?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  We serve because we love Him,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  這是很不同的difference,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  big difference,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  Being versus doing,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  Being versus doing,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  神愛我們,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  我們可以愛身邊的人,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  Not because we need to get love from each one of them,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]  We are not desperate for love,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  from relationships,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  from society,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  We are free to love,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  because God's love is in and through,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  love goes in and through us,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  goes in and through us,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  另一個林宣豪,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  Jeremy Lin,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  他剛剛上年贏過NBA Championship,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  in 2019,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  The first Asian to win an NBA Championship,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  但你知不知道他打了多久的時間?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  How long did he play for in the finals?
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  He played for only maybe a minute or two minutes,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  在game over那次,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  差不多over那次,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  他要有人sub,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  他就come in,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  He only played for a minute or two,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  他自己懷疑自己,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  Am I really a champion?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  我只是打了一兩個分鐘,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]  在那個final那次,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  做NBA的球員,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  不容易的,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  你的stat,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  你射得好,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  如果你的stat好,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  你射得好,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  你defend得好,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  You get to play,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  但你一射得不好,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  或者coach覺得你不是team的system,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  他就可能put you on the bench,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  You can't play,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  但林雪玉怎樣說,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  他的identity不是一些stat,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]  不是射得多好,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  多準,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]  His identity is found in God,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  in God's love for him,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  and he is a champion,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  not because of what he's done,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]  the minute that he played,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  but because of what God has done,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]  in and through his life,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  He is a champion,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  and we are champions,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  we are adopted as his child,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  not because of what we've done,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]  不是因為我們做了什麼special,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  我們自己不是可以當我們自己,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]  It's because of what God has done,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  through Jesus Christ,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  You are adopted.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]  我記得我們有一個學生,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  他之前,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  小時候,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  他爸爸媽媽經常和他讀聖經,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  讀什麼呢?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  讀The Book of Judges,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  or The Book of Deuteronomy,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]  經常說,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  如果你不做這件事,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  神會punish你,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]  神會punish你,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  神會punish你,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]  他長大的時候,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  就經常覺得神是一個punishing God,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  他經常覺得他自己是錯的,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]  He's not good enough,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  He's not good enough to be accepted,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  as his son and daughter,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  to be adopted,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]  to be loved,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]  他覺得他自己不是神愛,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  我記得我和他hiking一次,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  on the top of the mountain,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]  or the hill 那個時候,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  他就和我說,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  Johnny, 我很嬲神,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  I told God to strike me down,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  他覺得神很,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  so against him,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  我就說, 你冷靜點,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  神愛你的,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  我們開始讀新約的時候,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]  其實他沒有讀新約,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  其實舊約,新約都說,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  God loves us,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  God is slow to anger,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]  quick to listen,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]  and abundant in love,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  in the Old Testament,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  他慢慢看新約的時候,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  他發現神猜不住耶穌,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]  因為祂為我們,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]  為我們死,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]  主耶穌為我們死,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  釘十字架,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  and He is a love child,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  and now,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  He is willing to go out in love,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  to reach other people,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  other groups,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  non-Christians,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  and so today,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]  I hope that you know,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  you are adopted as a child of God,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  there's nothing you can do,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  that will change that,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  that God loves you,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  我們有三個application,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  第一樣,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]  是你,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]  do you realize,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  你是一個child of God,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  神是領養你的,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  我希望如果你未,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  你是可以接受主耶穌是你的救主,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]  and you have confessed Jesus to be the Lord and Savior in your life,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  你會有一個new identity,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  a new family,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  and a new inheritance in Jesus Christ,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  第二樣,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  are you acting like a child of God,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  a son and a daughter,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  are you acting like a son or a daughter,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  沒有的話,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  we need to be imitators of God,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  be more and more like Jesus Christ,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  walk in the light,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  walk in His love,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  be filled with the spirit,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  被聖的寵物,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  我們是不是acting like children of God,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]  第三樣,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  if we are acting like children of God,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  are we sharing His love,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]  我們在這個society,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  在這個時間,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  這麼多的hopelessness,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]  are we being the light of Christ,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]  are we going out in the love of Christ,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]  to love others,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  to give people hope in this dark time,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  the greatest hope is the living hope,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  and that is Jesus Christ,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]  there is no greater time now,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]  to share the love of God,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]  to share the hope of Christ,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]  and so I hope that today,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  you know you are an adopted child of God,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  and that God wants to live in and through you,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]  to be the light in this city,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]  in this dark time,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  God bless you.
