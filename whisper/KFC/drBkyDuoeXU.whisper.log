[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (electronic clicking)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.160]   Hello, and welcome back to SPAN TV,
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.080]   and it's time for another NAS face-off.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.440]   Slight difference this time.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.240]   I know you guys are probably sick of the Synology
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.720]   versus QNAP, QNAP versus Synology videos I do,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.400]   so we're trying to phase in more and more brands
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.480]   and get the brands interested,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.080]   and more importantly, to give you a better understanding
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.400]   of which NASes you should get
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.360]   for your individual media setup.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.480]   So, as you can tell from the title,
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.800]   this comparison is going to be
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.200]   between the WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.520]   WD's latest NAS there, the 2-Bay,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.040]   and we're gonna face it off against
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760]   Synology's own latest 2-Bay cost-effective NAS,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.960]   Synology's DS216J, a very popular NAS indeed,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.760]   and it's a NAS a lot of people,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520]   a lot of you guys out there are asking us
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.720]   to compare other units against.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.400]   Now, there's no denying they're part
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.960]   of the cost-effective bracket of NAS.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.840]   That is to say that you're not paying a huge amount,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.920]   but what you get, you do get quite a lot of features.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.560]   So, you can forget about things like Plex Media transcoding
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.800]   and high-end 4K surveillance,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.000]   and the big, big, and virtualization
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240]   would be an absolute joke on these two NASes,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.800]   to be perfectly honest with you,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.880]   but at the same time,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.520]   there are lots of things these NASes can do,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.800]   and if you are sticking towards the more traditional,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.140]   old-school ways of using NAS file backup,
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.240]   media streaming, DLNA, the occasional image backup,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.020]   then these NASes might be right for you,
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.040]   but of course, you don't know which one's,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.160]   you know, it's better of the two,
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.720]   which one better suits your needs.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.640]   So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna break down
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.360]   the pluses, the minuses,
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.800]   and give you a better understanding
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   which one deserves your data.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.160]   So, straight away, probably one of the more important factors
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.040]   for a great many of you is, of course, cost.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.520]   I can tell you right now that the WD MyCloud EX2
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360]   arrives at span.com, available now for, nice plug,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.440]   Â£123 without the VAT and without drives.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.280]   However, this unit can be purchased with drives,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.520]   and those are WD drives installed at WD MyCloud system.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.000]   And suitably, those drives are reduced in price as well.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.820]   So, if you do buy this unit pre-populated with drives,
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.360]   you will find those prices are lower
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320]   once you've installed the hardware, the hard drives.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.680]   Whereas the Synology DS216J arrives at Â£119,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.080]   so it's the cheaper of the two.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.280]   However, it should be stated that you can't purchase
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.880]   this unit pre-populated in the conventional sense.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.440]   You can buy this unit from vendors,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.040]   including span.com, again, subtle plug,
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.120]   with drives inside.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.200]   Now, install the drives for you at no additional cost,
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.680]   but of course, the drives will still work out
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000]   more expensive on the whole once installed in the Synology
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   as they would be if they're pre-installed,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.640]   pre-populated in the WD, so do bear that in mind.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.800]   So, yes, the Synology is the cheaper of the two,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.480]   but once you start looking at these devices
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   with the hard drives installed,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.920]   the WD will work out a pinch cheaper,
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.080]   particularly given that you will be installing
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.000]   most likely in this day and age,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.360]   and the popularity of them, WD Red NAS hard drives.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   Anyway, the drives that are installed in this device.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.000]   So, for the price round, I'm gonna give this to the Synology
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.640]   with that extra caveat.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.360]   Now, they're both 2-Bay NASes.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.800]   Neither of them can be expanded in the conventional sense
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.760]   with an expansion, but you can attach USB drives.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.720]   We'll get to that later on about ports.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.480]   With regards to the hardware,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.120]   the MyCloud EX2 arrives with a Marvell Armada 385 chip,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.880]   and that's a dual-core 1.3 gigahertz CPU,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.240]   and the unit also arrives with one gigabyte of DDR3 RAM.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.160]   The Synology DS216J, as mentioned in other videos,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.440]   arrives with the Marvell Armada 385,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.200]   exactly the same kind of chip,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.720]   but a lower frequency, being a dual-core 1.0 gigahertz chip.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.440]   So, a lower CPU of the two,
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.160]   and also arrives with half a gig of DDR3 RAM,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.360]   as you can see on the screen.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.880]   So, straight away, the WD MyCloud does have a higher spec
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.320]   with regard to those two,
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.920]   probably the most conventionally understood areas of hardware.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   It's got this lot of little thing
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.480]   about build quality and OS,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.960]   but when it comes to those two staples of CPU and RAM,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.080]   then these two factors in the WD give it superiority,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.760]   and I've got to give this round to the WD.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.080]   So, if we look at the rear of these two devices
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   on the screen right now,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.680]   'cause the front's only got some LED lights for you there,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.960]   and a button, you can see that both of these units
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.840]   arrive with two USB 3.0 ports and a gigabit LAN port,
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.680]   and they've both got ventilation on the rear.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.520]   But I've got to say,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.040]   there's a little bit more ventilation throughout
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.880]   on the WD MyCloud.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.040]   Additionally, the drives,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.000]   once you try to install them in the two ones that you j,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.160]   you have to dismantle the unit ever so slightly
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.560]   to slide those drives in,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.120]   whereas with the WD MyCloud EX2,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.640]   there is a little bit more of a hot-swapping ability there
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.200]   with the drives sliding through the two,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.000]   but I don't advise hot-swapping on this device as such.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.720]   But just for those ports and the physicality
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.120]   and the ventilation through the device,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.640]   and the fact that the WD MyCloud,
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.200]   I know you can't really tell on the screen there,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.920]   is quintessentially smaller.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.480]   If you look at the unboxing video for both,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.560]   you can see that they are smaller, the WD.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.400]   I've got to give this round also to the WD,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.140]   which is surprising even to me.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.480]   Now, both of them have got their own software on board,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.920]   the NAS software on the Synology, the DSM 5.2,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.680]   whereas WD have got their own native OS on there,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.480]   but it's not updated anywhere near as much,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.240]   and straight away, in terms of software,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.880]   louder rumble you're gonna hear in the video.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.840]   The software options, the bigger and better software options
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.880]   are, is superior on the Synology,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.520]   but we'll get to that more later on.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.440]   And they both use an EXT4 file system internally.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.320]   Now, with regards to use, the WD is nowhere near as diverse
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.120]   as the Synology in terms of apps and ability.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.960]   It handles, it should be said, though,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.000]   it does handle traditional NAS needs,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.400]   as mentioned earlier in the video, very, very well,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.520]   and in many respects, superior to the Synology.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.880]   The DLNA media sharing, it communicated with my PS4
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.800]   a lot better than the Synology.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   It sort of popped up immediately and integrated
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.640]   and accessed those directly, and the files were distributed
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.880]   a lot quicker and automatically better than in the Synology,
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.820]   where I had to create directories first.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.840]   As a media server, they're pretty much even,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.720]   and as a mail server, even still,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.920]   but as a download server, the Synology was a little better.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.680]   I think it just gave more license to do more things
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.020]   as a download station.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.600]   But the WD did hold its own very, very well.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.280]   As an image backup for you Apple Time Machine users
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.300]   out there, both of these units are completely compatible
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.660]   with Apple Time Machine.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.080]   However, the WD lets you create those images
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.440]   with the Apple software, whereas with the Synology,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.000]   they're phasing out the Apple Time Machine app
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.620]   in their app store, and slowly but surely,
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.960]   as many of you may have known about the DS216J
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.600]   in previous reviews, that the image software
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.220]   that the Synology comes with is becoming
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.580]   just more compatible with Apple Time Machine.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.960]   The Apple Time Machine app is slowly disappearing
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.460]   from the app store, but apart from that,
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.420]   the units are very, very similar indeed.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.380]   Last quick mention, the WD My Cloud arrives
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.620]   with a Plex Media app available to be installed.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.700]   Now, they both have that, but you have to kind of install
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.340]   it externally with the DS216J via the DSM PC
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.660]   and get the installation file and install it.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.700]   Now, neither of these units can transcode,
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.820]   as I've mentioned earlier in the video,
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.240]   but just because that Plex Media app
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.740]   and the way it was running things,
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.700]   and of course that hardware behind it,
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.920]   software-wise, if you're going for just traditional means
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.740]   for your NAS use, go for the WD.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.900]   Those small jobs, you know, you want them done well.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.040]   You don't need them quickly.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.980]   If you were looking at quickly,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.720]   you wouldn't have been looking at budget NASes like these,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.620]   these cost-effective NASes, but between the two of them,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.220]   for those core NAS needs, I've got to give this
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.540]   to the WD, with the caveat that the Synology
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.500]   has a huge app store by comparison.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.740]   You can do far more diverse things with it.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.660]   There's Torrent, other FTP, other mouse server options.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.700]   There's music sharing apps that you wouldn't get on the WD,
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.340]   and of course, educational apps as well,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.800]   but they can be a little temperamental
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.660]   and they are mixed among beaters.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.140]   With that phasing out of Apple Time Machine,
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.820]   it has put a lot of people off, but it has to be said,
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.440]   it does hold its own, and if you're looking
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.300]   for things outside of the traditional means
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.700]   of using a NAS, slightly more experimental by comparison,
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.260]   then definitely go for the Synology.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.420]   So in many respects, for me, the WD did win
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.380]   in terms of use in the traditional sense,
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.840]   but overall, it's got to be a draw.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.140]   Now, wrapping this comparison up,
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.540]   we can say they've both got two years
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.420]   of manufacturer's warranty, so if there's any hardware
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.900]   problems whatsoever, both respective manufacturers
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.880]   will cover you for that two-year period.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.260]   Now, for power consumption, the WD utilised 14.1 watts
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.100]   whilst in access, and 4.22 watts whilst
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.020]   in hard drive hibernation, that is low power
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   not being used idle, whereas the Synology utilised
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.180]   14.85 watts whilst in access, and 6.95 watts
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.020]   whilst in that hibernation standby,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.480]   whatever you want to call it.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.340]   So, less power was utilised by the WD,
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.860]   which I found a little bit surprising to be honest,
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.420]   'cause I thought Synology had really trimmed things down
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.820]   with the 216J.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.620]   Nevertheless, I've got to give that round to the WD as well,
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.140]   and again, I'm as surprised as you are by this comparison.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.180]   Finally, let's talk about read and write speed,
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.020]   with such similar chips, and not much of a difference
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.820]   between them, apart from the frequency and the double RAM,
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.660]   you'd think the results would be very similar indeed,
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.840]   and do you know what, they're not that far off.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.380]   The read on a WD MyClad EX2 was 116 megabytes per second,
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.860]   and the write was 118 megabytes per second,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.400]   where on the Synology, the DS216J,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.700]   it was 112 megabytes per second read,
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.220]   and 97.6 megabytes per second write,
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.420]   and a lot of that is to do with that CPU
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.020]   and that RAM being lesser than its contemporary.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.980]   So, straight away we can see the read and write,
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.220]   or upload and download, however you want to call it,
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.620]   was superior on the WD.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.740]   So, here we are at the end of the comparison,
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.500]   it might not come as a huge surprise to tell you
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.220]   that I'm gonna put my weight, surprisingly,
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.060]   behind the WD MyClad.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.160]   I've always put the WDs and the Seagates
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160]   behind the Synologies and the QNAPs.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.000]   Their software never seemed quite as user-friendly,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.160]   and if you're completely new to NAS,
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.920]   I've always thought you would find a very smooth transition
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.540]   with the Synology, but that said,
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.400]   I'm doing a video very, very soon
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.720]   that really goes through the WD MyClad software,
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.640]   and you will see they have made drastic improvements
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.980]   to that OS, and the UI is considerably better.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.640]   And not just that, but given the hardware
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.080]   and what you're spending and what you get,
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.100]   and not forgetting earlier in the video,
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.680]   the fact that if you buy the units pre-populated,
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.280]   they do work out cheaper overall,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.280]   and to you people that have come
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.200]   to a cost-effective NAS video, that must be important.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.480]   That's why the WD MyClad, for me,
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.700]   is the better NAS of these two.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.360]   That said, if the needs you have for NAS are ever-growing,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.440]   and you're looking for a NAS to really push the boundaries
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.820]   of network-attached storage on a server,
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.340]   then do give the DS216J a look.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.120]   Those extra apps, the software being more fluid,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.440]   and the fact that of the two, I would say
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.960]   that the Synology will sync much better
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   with you Mac users than the WD.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.680]   That isn't to say that it won't work with Mac,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.000]   but you'll just feel it vibe better in the way it works,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.960]   and the way the OS feels is far more Mac-appropriate,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.640]   then definitely give it a look.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.360]   So, I hope you enjoyed this comparison.
