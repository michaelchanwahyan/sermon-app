[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   What is life all about?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   12 weeks ago, Michelle seemed to take the words from the lips of the writer to Ecclesiastes,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   whether it was Solomon or not, by asking a question,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   "Is life worth living?"
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And for 11 weeks, the preacher, Kohalef, has been experimenting and investigating life under the sun.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   He appears to strongly come to the conclusion, "No, it is not worth living."
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And he supports his argument with the monotony of life,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   the vanity of wisdom, the futility of wealth, and the certainty of death.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   But this week, it's different.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   It's as though the speaker has reviewed his previous arguments and reversed his findings.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's like a spiritual version of football's VAR.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   He's come to the conclusion that life is worth living.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   The writer appears to have learned, "Oh yes, life is monotonous,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   but it's filled with challenges and opportunities from God.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Oh, and yes, wealth could be enjoyed and employed for the glory of God."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And though wisdom couldn't explain everything, it was better to follow God's wisdom.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Remember last week, the man's folly.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And yes, death is certain, but there's no way to escape it.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   So let's make the most of this life and the opportunities that it gives us.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And maybe this is the key.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   The author may be approaching the latter stages of his life
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and is beginning to see things in a truer perspective.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I love the Our Daily Bread reading notes.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I've been doing them for 30-odd years.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And they sent me a package about three weeks ago.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It was quite frightening.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   These are the books.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   They sent me seven books.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Seven books.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I don't know if they knew how old I was.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I think they just sent me because I was a pastor.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And the first one was called "Growing Old Gracefully, Following Jesus to the End."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I'm reading a chapter every night before I go to sleep.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And unbelievably, if finishing well wasn't direct enough, think about heaven.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Ecclesiastes employs many metaphors to describe the vanity of life.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It talks about chasing the breeze, a path of smoke, dust in the wind,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   or the laughter of fools, or a forgotten memory.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Life without God, as the writer has demonstrated in many ways, is utterly meaningless.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Now towards the end, the writer seems to resolve all the questions he has raised
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and he gives his ultimate conclusion.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Life is not about the five senses.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Life is more than we just see.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It is much more.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And here, the writer will summarise his conclusion by sharing four different conclusions.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   He's going to tell us this.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Life is an adventure.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Life is a gift.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Life is a school.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And life is a stewardship.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And what I want to do tonight is look at these one at a time.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Firstly, life is an adventure.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Life is an adventure and we are to live it by faith.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And the writer of Ecclesiastes shares two illustrations
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   which demonstrate what it means to live by faith.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The first one is the investor and the second one is the farmer.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Let's look at them one at a time.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Firstly, the investor or merchant.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Bonnie read this to us.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   For merchants in biblical times, going out to sea was a risky venture.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Ecclesiastes was saying, don't let that stop you.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And indeed, it offers some advice.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   As many of you know, I was involved in the financial services industry.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The running joke was, how do you make a small fortune?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   The way of making a small fortune was to give John Snellgrove a large fortune to invest for you.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Even my arrival in Hong Kong in 1987 was accompanied by the stock market crash.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   We know as Black Monday.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   But these verses actually give some practical financial advice.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   If you want to live life by adventure, you have to put some money aside for a rainy day.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So like they say, don't put all your eggs in one basket.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You learn to diversify your investments.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And yet, verse 2, look at it.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It says to give.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Notice, not to invest, give.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Give a portion to divide it amongst seven or eight.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So it's not just about diversifying income.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   It is also about stewardship.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   It's about how to give money away as well.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I love it how the New Living Translation translates this verse.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I'm going to read it to you.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Send your grain across the seas, and in time, profits will flow back to you.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Today, I guess we'd say, don't put your extra bread in the freezer, give it away.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Jesus underscored this wisdom when he said, "Freely you have received, freely give."
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Now to send your grain across the seas means to invest your money in other people.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It is an act of faith.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Our instinct, isn't it, is to hog all the money.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Or use the money on just ourselves.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Yet the point of this passage is that one has to have faith with the money that you give away.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   When you receive an amount of money, trust God with it.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Give it to God and his work.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   See how the investment returns back to you.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Now it doesn't mean that if you empty your bank account, and you give it to the church,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   that God is going to give you a windfall. I'm not saying that.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   But it does mean that when you give to God in faith, when you invest in his kingdom,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   there will be returns to that investment in your life.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   So the first example is the investor.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   The second example of living by faith is the farmer.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I've got a nice picture of the farmer here.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I want to show you four verses.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Four ways that the farmer demonstrates living by faith.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Let's look at the first one, verse 3.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So firstly, the farmer looks up and around to see if there is danger on the horizon.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   We're told here about falling trees, and we've had some today, I think.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Falling trees and/or falling rain. We've had both of those today.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I love the Hong Kong Observatory website.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   It's actually amazingly accurate.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   If we're preparing for a day out, perhaps a boat trip to an outlying island,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   we can check on the possibility of rain, the humidity, the wind direction.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   We can see if any typhoons are approaching.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And for a farmer, working in harmony with the weather is fundamental to maximizing crop yields.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And so farmers seem to have this inbuilt ability to sense conditions
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   that will be dangerous to that crop yield.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Let's read on, verse 4.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   "He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap."
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So secondly, the farmer is not so cautious that he does nothing.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But he doesn't spend his time daydreaming.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   He doesn't spend his time with his head in the sand.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   We all know enough, don't we?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   That we don't go to the swimming pool in the middle of a T8.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   In the same way, the farmer wouldn't go out to sow seeds or pick the crop.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   The context comes from verse 5. I've put it up.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   "As you do not know the way the Spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   so you do not know the work of God who makes everything."
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And thirdly, the farmer realizes that ultimately, all things are ultimately in God's hands.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   He realized that he cannot know everything that God can do.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So he trusts God by faith.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Look at verse 6.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   "In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Lastly, the farmer proceeds with his work with an eye towards all possible contingencies.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   This expression, "you don't know" actually appears three times in chapter 11.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yes, life is an adventure.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   While the farmer is trusting God by faith, he is prepared to act if the situation changes.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   So the first way to see life is that it is an adventure.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   The second way to view life is that it is a gift.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I want to tell you that life is a gift and we are to enjoy it.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Look at this.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   "Life is sweet and pleasant for the eyes to see the sun."
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   But let him remember that the days of darkness will be many.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   All that comes is vanity.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   First of all, what does the preacher mean when he says that light is sweet
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   and that seeing the sun is pleasant?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I don't know about you and I, I want to put my sunglasses on straight away.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   But from a psychological point, sorry, I got it wrong, physiological point,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   researchers continue to learn more and more about the truthfulness of this statement.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   We know that exposure to sunlight releases serotonin in the body,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   a hormone that helps regulate mood, calm anxiety, balance digestion and other many functions.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   For all its simplicity, a walk in the sunshine is one of the greatest weapons
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   against various forms of mood disorders.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But it's also interesting to note that the subtle shift is taking place
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   towards what is happening here.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Because the writer, for 11 weeks we've been talking about the phrase "under the sun"
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   throughout Ecclesiastes.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Now he's directing us to gaze towards the sun.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And the preacher will finally turn our attention above the sun in the epilogue.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   But in the meantime, what he's saying is this,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   don't wait until you're old and grey like me.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Start when you're young.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Now history has always seen the older generation, the so-called wise,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I'm right Vincent, aren't I?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   The so-called wise, telling the young generation what to do.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   When I was young, a long time ago, the advice to make it in life
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   was to forget everything else and concentrate on what we called the three R's.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Anyone remember those?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Which were apparently reading, writing, hold on, and arithmetic.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Obviously spelling wasn't one of them.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   But here the preacher, Kahlil, gives us his three R's.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He says rejoice, remove and remember.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   So let us first rejoice.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Rejoice, oh young man, in your youth.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   But know that for all these things that God will bring you into judgment.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Charles Spurgeon, the great 19th century preacher, once said,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "It's not how much we have, but how much we enjoy that gives us happiness."
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Rejoice and then remove.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Remove sorrow from your heart and put away pain from your flesh
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   because youth and the prime of life are fleeting.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Let go of the pain and remove sadness.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   You don't need to be filled with sadness in your life.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   We are told, aren't we, that the youth and the prime of life are fleeting.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Many of us ask ourselves, where did that time go, right?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And we ask it more when we get older, I tell you.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Ecclesiastes says, don't waste it.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   So rejoice, remove and then remember.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   The final command is to remember our creator in the days of our youth.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   We are told to do so before the evil days appear.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Turn to God before old age sets in.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Remember also your creator in the days of your youth
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   before the evil days come and the years draw near,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   of which you will say, I have no pleasure in them.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   The key words here, two words, remember and before.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   The word before begins the final poem of Ecclesiastes.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And for this poem, the preacher writes heavily in metaphors.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I'll need to explain it to you.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So the meaning could be quite difficult to interpret.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Now to find the meaning, we need to understand that verses 2 to 7 are poetical.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   They're poetically used to cement the idea presented in verse 1.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   He tells us to remember our creator in the days of our youth.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And now he defines what he means by youth.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   He says, remember God before blank happens to your body.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   That's the definition of youth.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Remember God before blank opens your body.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   God blanks in in a moment.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And between Ecclesiastes 12, 3 to 5, we see 13 parts of a picture
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   that are used to describe the process of life and ageing.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   The picture of a house.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Here we see different parts of a house that begin to fall apart.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   When we have an old house, it begins to fall apart.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Warren Wiersbe actually lists here 13 different parts of the house that fall apart.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   This is quite interesting.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   He said, in the day when the keepers of the house tremble.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   He's talking about your hands and your arms trembling.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It happens when you get older.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And strong men are bent.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Your knees, your legs, your shoulders, they weaken.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And you start to walk like this.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   You're bent.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And the grinders cease.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   You start to lose your teeth.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Thank goodness for Peter and for Florence.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   That's all I say.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   You start to lose your teeth as you get older.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And those who look through the windows are dimmed.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Your vision begins to deteriorate.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Thank goodness for Gordon and for others.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And the doors on the street are shut.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Either your hearing starts to fail, or you close your mouth because you've lost your teeth.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   On to the next slide.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   When the sound of the grinding is low.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   You can't chew your food.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Or your ears can't pick up the sound outdoors.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Rises up at the sound of a bird.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   You wake up with the birds every morning and wish you could sleep longer.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And all the daughters of song are brought low.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Your voice starts to quiver and waken.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And they are also afraid of what is high.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   You're terrified of heights.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And afraid of falling when you walk down the street.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   The almond tree blossoms.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   If you have any hair left, it turns white.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Like almond blossoms.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   The grasshopper drags itself along.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   You also drag yourself along like a grasshopper at the close of a summer season.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And desire fails.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   You lose your appetite.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Or perhaps your sexual desire.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Because man is going to his eternal home.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And the mourners go about the streets.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You go to your eternal home.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And people mourn your death.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   That's what the poem means.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   But let's have a look at the rest of the poem.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   This is interesting.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Before the silver cord is snapped or the golden bowl is broken.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Or the pitcher is shattered at the fountain.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Or the wheel broken at the cistern.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Again, poetic reminder to make the most.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   The silver cord is actually our spinal cord.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   The golden bowl is broken is our brain.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   The pitcher is shattered refers to our veins.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Or the wheel broken at the cistern.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   It means our heart no longer works.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And death follows old age.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   He says this, "And the dust returns to earth as it was.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And the spirit returns to God who gave it.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Vanity of vanities, says the preacher.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   All is vanity.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Look where we ended up.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Vanity of vanities.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   You've heard that before, right?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   All is vanity.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Vanity of vanity.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   How fitting is it that this poem of finality should conclude
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   with the verse that began in the first poem in Ecclesiastes.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   But let me summarise this call.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   This call to enjoy life with a message to both the young and the old.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Firstly to the young, rejoice in the days of your youth.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Remove the sins and the frustration that will ruin and waste your life.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And remember your creator now.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   As a young person now, prepare for the day that you will walk through chapter 12's poem.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Secondly, to the old.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Your latter years are not the time to coast through life.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   The race is almost complete.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   So sprint to the finish line.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And now we come to the final section of the final chapter of the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   For 11 chapters, we have been looking at ways that people try to find meaning in life
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   and how that effort fails.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   The author then turns to his take on what life is all about.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Earlier we looked at life as an adventure.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Life as a gift.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   We end this section as well as the book with two last ways to view life.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   One should live life as a school and as a stewardship.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   So thirdly, life is a school. We are to learn our lessons.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Someone said that life is like a school except you sometimes don't know what the lessons are
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   until you've failed the examination.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It's true, right?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   God teaches us primarily from his word.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I can't just reinforce what Bonnie said.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   We're doing 1 Corinthians over the next eight weeks.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Take time this week. Set aside time and read 1 Corinthians.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You will get so much more out of the sermon series if you've read the book for yourself
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   because God teaches us primarily through his word.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But he also teaches us through creation, through history and the various experiences of life.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   So let's take a look at the characteristics of God's curriculum in the school of life.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Number one, God's curriculum is wise.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Verse 9, "Besides being wise, the preacher also taught the people knowledge."
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   As always in wisdom literature, knowledge is more important than information.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   For verse 1-7 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, the beginning of knowledge."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   "Fools despise wisdom and instruction."
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   It involves the know-how of understanding and applying God's will to everyday life.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   But even more, it entails the know-whom of a relationship of fear, obedience and loyalty towards God.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Secondly, God's curriculum is orderly.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   It says here, "Weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs with great care."
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I mean, God's word may sometimes be difficult to read sometimes.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   But it does have an order, a pattern, a grand story, a narrative.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Once you understand that, then learning God's curriculum is easy to understand.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Thirdly, God's curriculum is accurate.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   "The preacher sought to find words of delight and uprightly he wrote words of truth."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   The truth that God's word shares is accurate.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Now there may be parts of the Bible we don't understand. I understand that.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   But I tell you, a 12th grade student has a better understanding of English than a first grader.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   The reason that student has spent much more time with the subject matter.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   The same is true with the Word of God.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Fourthly, God's curriculum is inspired.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   "The words of the wides are like goads and like nails, firmly fixed are the collected sayings."
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   "They are given by one shepherd."
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I think one of the things about church today, you know, it's...
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   There's a lot of comments on style, you know.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   When you talk about preachers, sometimes it's, you know, it's not what they're saying,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   but the way it's sort of delivered, the style, you know, which has become a little bit like that.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Particularly like those sort of mega church type model.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   God's word. God's word is just as important as the way it's transmitted.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It doesn't matter if you read it on a printed Bible or a smartphone.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   God's word will work. It is inspired.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   "All scripture is God breathed out by God and profitable for teaching."
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   "It is for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness."
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   "That the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   2 Timothy.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   It has a purpose.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And it doesn't matter the method of transmission.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   The message will be meaningful for eternity.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Jesus said it this way, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I just want to go back to that phrase, "The words of the wise are like goads."
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   You might not know what a goad is.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Goad is a pointed stick.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   It's used to guide and prod animals in the direction the herder wants them to go.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   A wise teacher sometimes use sharp and painful words to guide students as they think through difficult issues.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Lastly, God's curriculum is sufficient.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It says, "My son, beware of anything beyond these."
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   "Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of flesh."
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   You go to a Christian bookshop today.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   There's enough books there to last about 20 of your lives.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   There's so many books now.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I just want to tell you, read other books.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Other than the Bible, it's like taking elective courses.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Electives are not necessary to complete learning in school.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Being in band or sports may give you a wider understanding and experience,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   but they are not necessary to graduate from school.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   The same is true spiritually.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   You can read devotional books from various authors to gain insight, and it's very good.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   However, they are elective courses.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   They are not the Bible.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   We're nearly there, and we've possibly saved the most important to last.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Life is a stewardship.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Fear God.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Jesus summarized the Old Testament with the following two commands.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind."
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   This is the first and great commandment.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And the second is like this, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Now here in Ecclesiastes, we too have a summary of the Old Testament.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Verse 13, "The end of the matter, all has been heard."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   For God will bring every deed into judgment with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And so we are reminded to do two very important things.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   To fear God and to keep God's commandment.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Ecclesiastes ends where the book of Proverbs begins.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   With an encouragement for us, a command to fear the Lord.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Oswald Chambers said the remarkable thing about fearing God is that when you fear God, you fear nothing else.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Whereas if you do not fear God, you fear everything else.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   If I fear God, and by fear I mean give proper respect to God,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   then I'll want to keep his commands, keep his commandments.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   If God's word lasts forever, then it's best to learn to keep his commands.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And Ecclesiastes finishes with a call.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   A call to prepare for the final judgment.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I know we don't like talking about this in church, but it says,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   "For God will bring every deed into judgment with every secret thing, whether good or evil."
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   If there is no God, there is no judge.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   If there is no judge, there will be no final judgment.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   If there is no final judgment, there is no ultimate meaning to life.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Nothing matters.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   If there is no God to judge the world, then human existence is pointless.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   It's a pointless dispute that ends in meaningless despair.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   The preacher who wrote Ecclesiastes would have agreed.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   From the beginning of his book, he has been saying that if there is no God, there is no meaning.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Nothing matters.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   However, as Christians, we believe that life on earth does matter.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   There is a heaven and there is a hell.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   There is going to be a judgment.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It says here, there will be two judgments.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   The good and the bad judgment.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   If you are a Christian, you don't have to worry about judgment.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   The New Testament clarifies that a reward judgment awaits Christians.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Jesus paid the price. It was finished upon the cross.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   The bad judgment is for those who do not know Jesus.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   So, is life worth living?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Yes!
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   But only if you are truly alive through faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Then you can be satisfied.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   No matter what God may permit to come into your life.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   As I asked the band to come up, we are going to be singing a song.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   "I Will Build My Life."
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   My question to you is, what are you building your life upon?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Can I encourage you today, if you are not building your life upon Jesus Christ,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   if you are not trusting Him for your salvation,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   can I encourage you to do that?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Maybe you have never done that.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Maybe, well, I think I have, but I am not sure.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   The foundation has to be sure.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Let's just close our eyes for a moment.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   As I ask you the question, what are you building your life upon?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   If you are building your life upon anything other than Jesus Christ, it is quicksand.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   In Hong Kong, when we build a new skyscraper, the bit you don't see is actually those foundations go down deep.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   The foundations have to be laid first.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   The foundation is for you to surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Ask Him to forgive you of your sins and come into your life.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I just want to give an opportunity if there is anybody here tonight who hasn't done that yet.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Maybe you have been coming to church for weeks, but you have never given your life to Jesus Christ.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   You can do that right here and right now.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Just while every eye is closed, if there is anybody here tonight who wants to say,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   "Jesus, I give my life to you. I will build my life upon you."
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Just while every eye is closed, can you just raise your hand so I can see it, so I can pray for you.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It may well be we are all Christians and that is great together.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   But I want to give that opportunity.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Thank you, Jesus. Let's all stand together.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   And let's, as we finish this series in Ecclesiastes, let's declare this song together.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I will build my life upon the rock that is Jesus Christ.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   And yes, life is worth living. Amen.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
