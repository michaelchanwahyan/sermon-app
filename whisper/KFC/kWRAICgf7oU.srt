1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 Hello, Explorer!

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
 I know the pandemic is really bad in Hong Kong

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 but I hope this sermon will encourage you

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 to be a church of God

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 to continue to serve and pursue God.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 We are now in Explorer

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 talking about the Church series.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Last week, Pastor Irene told us

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 what the Church is.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 It's a fellowship of sinners.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 We all need Jesus to help us

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 to be our Savior.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Today, we are talking about what the Church is.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Church as the fellowship of the saints.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 In the book of Colossians, Paul tells us

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 "You have Jesus now.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Jesus has nailed the cross for you to die.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 So what?

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 We have accepted Jesus as our Savior.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So what?

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 We will not wear the old clothes.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Do you like to wear the old clothes?

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 The smelly clothes from the winter.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 The clothes from yesterday.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Do you like to wear them?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Of course not.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 They smell bad, right?

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Paul says, "Don't wear the old clothes.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 You have to wear new clothes.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 The old clothes are sins.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 What are they?

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 They are sins, they are temptations.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 But Paul wants you to wear new clothes.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 New clothes are beautiful, right?

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Are they beautiful?

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 These are not new.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 But Paul wants us to wear new clothes.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 What are new clothes?

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 We will look at Colossians 3, verse 12-17.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So you are the chosen ones of God, pure and unselfish people.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 You must wear the new clothes.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Therefore, you are humble, gentle, and patient.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 If this person and that person have a grudge,

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 they must be patient and forgive each other.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 The Lord has forgiven you,

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 and you must also forgive him.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 In addition, you must wear the new clothes,

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 because love is universal.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You must let the peace that Christ bestows

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 dwell in your hearts,

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 and for this reason you must be one.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 You must also have a heart of gratitude.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 When you use all kinds of wisdom

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 to enrich the heart with the truth of Christ,

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 use the verses of Psalms, Psalms, and Psalms to teach each other,

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 to advise each other,

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 and to plant the heart of gratitude.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Whatever you do,

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 whatever you say or do,

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 you must do it in the name of Jesus Christ.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Wearing the new clothes is a way of being grateful.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Yes, just now Paul told us

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 "You put on"

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 "Put on" these different things.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 He asked us what kind of people we are.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 We are God's chosen people.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Right?

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 We are holy.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 If there are so many people in the church

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 who have accepted Jesus Christ,

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 who are holy,

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 then this is a very good place.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Today I have seven points

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 about what quality our church has.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 First, the church is a place where we treat each other

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 as Christ does.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Verse 12 says, "Put on then as God's chosen people,

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 holy and beloved,

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 compassionate hearts,

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 kindness, humility, meekness, patience."

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Wow, if our church

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 has compassionate hearts,

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 kindness, humility, meekness, patience,

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 isn't that a very good place?

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 We see Jesus Christ,

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 he sees those 5,000 people

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 who are poor,

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 who have nothing to eat,

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 who are hungry,

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 he has compassion towards them.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He shows kindness towards them.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 He fed the 5,000.

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 He sees those prostitutes,

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 who are not liked by anyone,

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 who want to throw stones at them,

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 those adulterers,

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 what does he do?

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 He shows kindness towards them.

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Kindness towards them.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 First, the church is a place

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 where we treat each other

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 as Christ does.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Second, the church is a place

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 where we forgive one another.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Verse 11, "Bearing with one another,

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 if one has a complaint against another,

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 forgive each other,

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 as the Lord has forgiven you,

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 so you also must forgive."

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Paul tells us,

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Jesus has forgiven us.

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 God has forgiven us.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 He has nailed the cross for us.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 In the story,

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Jesus and the adulterer,

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 everyone wants to throw him into the ground,

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 because he committed a sin.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Jesus tells him,

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 "If you have no sin,

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 you throw the stone."

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But what is the result?

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 No one throws the stone.

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Why?

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Because everyone knows they have sinned.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 If they have no sin,

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 they will throw the stone.

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 He tells the adulteress woman,

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 "Has anyone thrown the stone?"

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 "No."

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 "I will also forgive you."

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 "Neither will I."

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 "Go and leave your life of sin."

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Church is a place where everyone is a sinner.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 We all have to accept one another,

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 and forgive one another.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Third, church is a place where we love with unity.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Love with unity.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 In verse 14, it says,

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 "Above all these things, put on love,

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 which binds everything together

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 in perfect harmony."

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Love brings us together.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Love helps us to accept one another.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Love is the most important thing.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 God first loved us.

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 We must love one another.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Fourth, church is a place of peace.

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 In verse 15, it says,

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts."

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 The peace of God, Jesus Christ,

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 must rule in our lives.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 During this pandemic,

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 do we have the peace of God, Jesus Christ?

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 This peace will bring us together as one body.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 One body.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Fifth, church is a place of thankfulness.

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Paul calls us to be thankful.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 When we are in church,

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 when we are in the Explorer,

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 do we have thankfulness?

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Do we have gratitude?

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 God says, "Wow, we can be together,

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 have a time of unity,

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 read the Bible together,

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 play together,

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 have a time to pray together."

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 When we are in church,

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 do we have gratitude?

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Are we thankful?

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Sixth, what is church?

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Church is a place where the Word of God

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 is the foundation.

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 The Word of God is our foundation.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 We are in the Explorer,

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 we read the Bible,

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 we have sermons,

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 we pray,

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 everything,

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 everything is the foundation of the Word of God.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 When we preach,

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 what is our foundation?

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 It's not our own inspiration.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Our inspiration is the Word of God.

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 We hope, we explore,

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 the foundation,

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 we worship,

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 we sing,

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 whatever we do,

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 the foundation is the Word of God.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Seventh,

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 last,

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 church is a place where everything is done for Christ.

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 In verse 17 it says,

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 "And whatever you do,

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 in deed or word,

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 giving thanks to God the Father through Him."

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 We are in church,

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 whatever we do,

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 we do it for the name of Jesus.

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Jesus is for Jesus.

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Then we, in everything that we do,

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 we must glorify God,

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 worship Jesus.

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Then we recap,

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 the church is a place where we treat each other as Christ does.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Church is a place where we forgive one another.

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Church is a place where we love in unity.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Church is a place of peace, of thankfulness.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Church is a place where God's Word is the foundation.

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And the church is a place where everything is done for Jesus Christ.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Wow, if we can do this kind of church,

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 isn't it an amazing place?

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 What a great place!

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Right?

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Now we will invite Sophia to share her experience.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Hello everyone, I am Sophia.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I am an intern at the church this year.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I am 18 years old and I am studying in England.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 What I like most about the church is that

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 we can strengthen our relationship with God in the church.

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Every Sunday we sing to God,

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 and after listening to the sermon, we have a discussion.

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 This is to prevent me from deviating from the path that God has chosen for me.

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And I think it is easier to make friends in the church than in school.

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I just finished saying that the church is a place where we treat others as Christ does.

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 I think we all experience God's love without conditions.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 It is easier to have more love and care for others.

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And it is less judgmental.

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 We can make the church great again.

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I think I can make more effort to improve my relationship with God.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And I can pay more attention to others.

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 We thank Sophia for her testimony.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 If we can do this at 7pm,

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 isn't the church an amazing place?

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 A great place.

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Now I have four points.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 How to make our church great again.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Upward, inward, outward, downward.

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 First, upward.

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 We need to focus on our relationship with God.

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 If we are closer to God,

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 we will become more like Jesus.

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 We can love those around us.

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Love those who are difficult.

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 We can have compassion to care for others.

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Become more like Jesus.

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 First, look upward.

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Second, look inward.

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 We need to look at ourselves.

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 We all have weaknesses.

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 We all have different places that make us angry.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 We are very angry.

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 We need to be aware of our weaknesses.

256
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Look inward.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Third, we need to look at our weaknesses.

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 What do we need to do?

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Look outward.

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 We need to make a plan.

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 When we run, we see a point.

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 We have a focus.

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 When we make a plan, we need to have a focus.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 We see our weaknesses.

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 How can we take initiative to help our church?

266
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 To love those around us.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 We need to have a plan to care for our church.

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Fourth, look downward.

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Look to give, not receive.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 John F. Kennedy told the United States,

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 "Do not look to what your country can do for you,

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 but look to what you can do for your country."

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 We are the same in church.

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 We don't always say, "Oh, what can the church give us?

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 What can we take?"

276
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But if we are truly following Jesus,

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 we will look to give to the church.

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Give to one another.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 We need to look downward.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 We need to see where our feet are going.

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 We need to give our best to Jesus.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 To serve.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 To use our gifts to serve our church.

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I remember when I first entered college,

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I experienced a group at college.

286
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Wow, we went out to preach together.

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 We cared for each other.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 We studied, we had many difficulties.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 We had relationships.

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 We prayed for our friends.

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 We served together.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 We organized fellowship campaigns at college.

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 This was the first time I experienced

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 an amazing fellowship.

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Church is an amazing place.

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I hope that we, as Explorers,

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 can do this 7-point.

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 To love one another.

299
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 To forgive one another.

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 To love one another.

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Church is a place of peace,

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 of thankfulness.

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 The Word of God is our foundation.

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And everything we do is for Jesus.

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 God bless you.
