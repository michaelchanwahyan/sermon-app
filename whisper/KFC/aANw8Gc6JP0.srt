1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 It's great to see everybody today.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,520
 We're starting a new series and it is our Advent Christmas series.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,960
 When you think of Christmas, what's the first couple of things you think of?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
 Shout it out.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,760
 What's the first couple of things you think about?

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,160
 Trees, lots of trees.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,560
 They especially grow in the winter, right?

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,560
 What other things do you think about?

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,560
 Huh?

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
 Heat?

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
 Food.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
 Yeah.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
 Party parties.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
 Yeah.

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
 What else?

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
 Come on, shout it out.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
 Beach.

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,560
 The beach in Australia.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
 Yes.

20
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
 Okay.

21
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
 Yeah.

22
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,880
 Paul is definitely thinking about the beach in Australia.

23
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,160
 Definitely a different side of the world.

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,560
 Presents.

25
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,080
 Yes.

26
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,240
 Presents.

27
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,040
 And a lot of the different pictures we get about Christmas come from this image that

28
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,560
 we have, right?

29
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,200
 And it could come from our Hallmark cards, right?

30
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,800
 We see Mary in her beautifully styled hair.

31
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,960
 She just came from Cathy's salon.

32
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,160
 She just got a nice hair straightening.

33
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:21,560
 She's in her beautiful dress and baby Jesus is perfectly washed in his white crib.

34
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,120
 Joseph is perfectly styled hair in his perfect robe.

35
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,640
 And then these beautiful kings come with all their presents and gold.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,920
 That's the sort of picture we might get of Christmas.

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,280
 It's a perfect picture.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
 Christmas is perfect.

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,360
 It's beautiful.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,240
 But is that the reality?

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,240
 Is that really Christmas?

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,960
 And today we're going to look at a specific person and her name is Mary.

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,360
 There's something about Mary.

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,600
 And the first thing we're going to look at, the first point is from unknown to favored.

45
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,080
 From unknown to favored.

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
 The angel Gabriel appears to her.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:21,000
 Now it's been over 400 years since an angel or God has directly spoken to the people of

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,200
 Israel.

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,560
 And when does Gabriel usually come out?

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
 Who is Gabriel?

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
 Well, Gabriel is one of the head angels, right?

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,160
 With Michael and Gabriel, there was Lucifer a bit.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,680
 He went a little, you know.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,640
 Gabriel, do you know when he usually comes out?

55
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,280
 He comes out in dealings with messianic things.

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,560
 So with Daniel, he appeared to Daniel and told him about the prophecies that were to

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
 come.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,600
 And now he appears, firstly in the chapter earlier, to Elizabeth, talking about John,

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,680
 how he is going to come and be born and prepare the way for Jesus.

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
 And now he appears to Mary.

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
 And who is Mary?

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
 What do we know about her?

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,560
 Well, we read six months, in the sixth month, angel Gabriel was sent from God to the city

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,760
 of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph.

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,920
 And so Mary, her Hebrew name was probably Miriam, was a very popular name back then,

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,480
 and she's from Nazareth.

67
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:49,360
 Now back then, Nazareth was just a very small town, maybe just like 50 to 100 people, maybe

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
 like a very small town in the territories.

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
 Has anybody heard of Mthongchoi?

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
 Mthongchoi, has anybody heard of that?

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
 It's a small town in the territories.

72
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,680
 And I know it, actually Kathy's been to it as well, because a couple of us went to visit

73
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
 the waterfalls there.

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
 It's a small little village.

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
 Actually, it's a hidden secret in Hong Kong.

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,480
 There's like seven waterfalls there.

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,920
 Vincent should go.

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,920
 Nazareth, it's in the middle of nowhere.

79
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,440
 It's a small little town.

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,960
 There's a picture of it on the next slide, right?

81
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,840
 In Nazareth, it's just a couple of houses, a couple of 50 to 100 people.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
 And what was Mary's job?

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,520
 She was just a peasant girl, taking care of the farm, taking care of the livestock, nothing

84
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
 significant.

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
 What did we know about her?

86
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,440
 Well, she was a virgin.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:59,520
 And we also know that she was betrothed or pledged to be married, pledged to be married.

88
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,440
 And we know that in Jewish customs back then, they usually married the girls off when they

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,560
 reached maturity.

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,400
 And so we can sort of calculate, oh, maybe she's in her early teens, right?

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
 Could be 13 or 14 years old.

92
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
 Anybody 13 or 14 here?

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,640
 I see some of my tightest kids are 13 or 14 and they're here.

94
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,200
 It could have been a teenage girl.

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,280
 It's not what we think about.

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,320
 Oh, Mary, she's middle-aged, mature, very ready for this task.

97
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:43,280
 No, it's a virgin girl, 14, working the farm.

98
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,720
 Just in the middle of nowhere, working the farm.

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,960
 And the Lord appeared to her through an angel.

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
 And let's see her response in verse 20.

101
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,120
 She was greatly troubled and said, at the saying, and tried to discern what kind of

102
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,680
 greeting this might be.

103
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,400
 And the angel said to her, do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,360
 You have found favor with God.

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:27,560
 From an unknown girl in this middle of nowhere town with a small population, a peasant girl,

106
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,960
 from unknown to favored.

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,520
 And she was greatly troubled at this greeting.

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,920
 She was greatly troubled.

109
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:48,280
 And at the end, we can continue to see that she goes from fear to faithful.

110
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,200
 She goes from fear to faithful.

111
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,400
 Let's continue reading verse 34.

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,120
 And Mary said to the angel, how will this be?

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,360
 Since I am a virgin, how could I be afraid?

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,080
 Since I am a virgin, how could I have a child who is going to be the Messiah?

115
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,520
 How could this be?

116
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,360
 Since I'm a virgin?

117
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,720
 And the angel answered her, the Holy Spirit will come to you, come upon you, and the power

118
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,040
 of the Most High will overshadow you.

119
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,640
 Let's continue to the next slide.

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,720
 For nothing will be impossible with God.

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,840
 And Mary said, behold, I am the servant of the Lord.

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,640
 Let it be according to your word.

123
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,560
 And the angel departed from her.

124
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,920
 The second thing we see about Mary is that she goes from fear.

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,520
 What's going on?

126
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,860
 What's this greeting?

127
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,000
 Why am I most favored?

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,020
 How am I blessed amongst women?

129
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:59,800
 What is this greeting to a faithful girl, obedient servant of the Lord?

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:08,200
 Now back then, the Jews were subjugated under Roman authority.

131
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,400
 Servants were hired, right?

132
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,680
 They were allowed to work and they were paid.

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,640
 They had limited rights.

134
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,220
 Jews were known to be owned by their slave owners.

135
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,300
 They had no rights and they were considered property.

136
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:32,060
 Women back then were only basically housewives, mothers, and wives.

137
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:38,380
 In Jewish society, it was a patriarchal society, men were at the top, women had no legal rights

138
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,820
 either, and women were owned by their father and their husband.

139
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:53,140
 And so what Mary is saying here, I am the servant of the Lord.

140
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:02,640
 She's saying I am willing to serve the Lord, give up my rights, fully obey, fully follow

141
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
 the Lord.

142
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,500
 She doesn't understand how this might all be possible, but she is saying I'm willing

143
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,260
 to follow the Lord.

144
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,060
 She goes from fear to faithful.

145
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,220
 She goes from fear to faithful.

146
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:28,100
 The third thing we see is that she goes from virgin to mother.

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
 And how can this be, right?

148
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,460
 She said the angel of the Lord said to her, the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the

149
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,580
 power of the Most High will overtake you.

150
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,980
 Can you imagine being a 14, maybe 14, 13 year old girl and receiving this message and then

151
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:57,900
 all of a sudden you are going to be a mother, mother not just of any ordinary child, a mother

152
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,900
 of the Most High.

153
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,500
 Would there be some pressure?

154
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,460
 Was there any pressure when you were about to become mothers, mothers that are here?

155
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
 Was there any pressure?

156
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,020
 Or you were like, yeah, let's go, bring it on.

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,580
 Auntie Jackie is like, not just one, bring on two.

158
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,500
 Where is the second one?

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,780
 No pressure at all, no worries.

160
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:27,580
 There must have been some pressure that was there.

161
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,460
 And yet we know that back then, Jewish society, they understood scripture.

162
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,260
 They understood that the Messiah was to come.

163
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,220
 And this verse must have been on Mary's mind when the angel told her this.

164
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,960
 Isaiah chapter 7, verse 14, therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,540
 The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and will call him Emmanuel.

166
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,740
 That must have been on her mind.

167
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,660
 I did some research and it said that Jewish girls back then knew of this verse.

168
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:15,180
 What a privilege it would be to be the mother of the Messiah.

169
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,740
 Now back then, the Jewish custom was arranged marriages.

170
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,180
 There was an engagement.

171
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,580
 The fathers would say, hey, yeah, this girl, she's becoming mature.

172
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,860
 Let's strike a deal.

173
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,220
 James, you got a nice son coming up.

174
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,500
 Let's strike a deal.

175
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,140
 Pastor James agrees.

176
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,220
 And they have an engagement, a formal agreement.

177
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,860
 Yes, your son will marry my daughter.

178
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,660
 And then there's some sort of meeting.

179
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,660
 It's called a betrothal or pledge.

180
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,500
 It's some sort of formal meeting where they say, yes, in a year's time,

181
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,380
 we will have a wedding and we will get married.

182
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,540
 And so which stage was Mary at?

183
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,740
 You guys remember?

184
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,620
 Was it the first one?

185
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,860
 No, it wasn't.

186
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,340
 The arrangement was already made.

187
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,260
 They were pledged to be married already.

188
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,380
 So you think about it.

189
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,500
 You've been pledged to a man.

190
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,740
 His name is Joseph.

191
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,860
 What does he do?

192
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,740
 He's a carpenter.

193
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,780
 He's a carpenter or a stone cutter or a wood maker or something like that,

194
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,220
 whatever they worked with back then.

195
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,980
 And you are going to be pregnant.

196
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,340
 What is Joseph going to think?

197
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,700
 Auntie Jackie, what is Paul going to think?

198
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,580
 Hallelujah.

199
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:07,300
 It's a little bit awkward.

200
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,660
 It would be awkward to explain to your parents.

201
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,340
 It would be awkward to explain to your fiance.

202
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,380
 And if we read-- let's read in Deuteronomy.

203
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,740
 Let's read this together.

204
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,700
 One, two, three.

205
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,540
 "If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married

206
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,460
 and he sleeps with her, you shall take both of them to the gate of that town

207
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,580
 and stone them to death."

208
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:43,420
 What is the cost of adultery or premarital sex?

209
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,920
 Death.

210
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,020
 It's not being stoned like high stoned, all right?

211
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,340
 It's being literally stoned to death.

212
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,220
 Not a pleasant thing.

213
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,060
 And so there was considerable risk of this teenage girl.

214
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,300
 How do I speak to my parents?

215
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,380
 How do I speak to my fiance that I am pregnant

216
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,940
 and that I am pregnant with the most high?

217
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,620
 She must have had real faith in God, in his message.

218
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:28,300
 And once she accepts that this is what the Lord has given her,

219
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:37,780
 the task to be pregnant with baby Jesus, she goes from silence to praise.

220
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,020
 From silence to praise.

221
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,540
 So six months earlier or a couple months earlier,

222
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,140
 the angel also appeared to Zachariah.

223
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:54,380
 And that was another promise that John the Baptist would come and prepare

224
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,700
 the way for a baby Jesus.

225
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,180
 And Elizabeth and Zachariah, they were very old.

226
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,100
 They were around 80 years old.

227
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,180
 And God gave them a baby at an old age.

228
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,740
 And so Mary takes a trip and goes to Elizabeth.

229
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,060
 Elizabeth is in Jerusalem.

230
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,900
 She's in Nazareth.

231
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:27,380
 So it's not a short trip back then.

232
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,780
 And what happens is that when they meet, John erupts.

233
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,620
 The Holy Spirit convicts Elizabeth.

234
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,700
 And the baby John in her belly.

235
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,860
 And there's sparks all over.

236
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,140
 And Mary sings this song.

237
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,460
 Let's just read the first two slides together.

238
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,900
 Or let's read it together.

239
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,980
 Let's read her song together, OK?

240
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,540
 One, two, three.

241
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,420
 And Mary said, my soul--

242
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,340
 let's read again.

243
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,700
 One, two, three.

244
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,660
 And Mary said, my soul magnifies the Lord.

245
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,380
 And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.

246
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,100
 For he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.

247
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,420
 For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.

248
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,300
 For he who is mighty has done great things for me.

249
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,900
 And holy is his name.

250
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,660
 And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.

251
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,540
 Let's skip a slide and read the last one.

252
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,900
 He has helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy

253
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,020
 as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.

254
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,060
 And Mary remained in her three months and returned to her home.

255
00:16:50,060 --> 00:17:00,260
 So she visits Elizabeth, who understands her because she was also given a promise.

256
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,540
 And Mary is excited.

257
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,860
 Elizabeth excited.

258
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,980
 The babies are excited.

259
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,700
 And she breaks out into song.

260
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,260
 It's like a Disney movie, right?

261
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,820
 Like, it's just a Disney--

262
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,540
 yeah, musical.

263
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,220
 And I'm not going to sing it for you.

264
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,180
 I know Mo likes to sing and rap.

265
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,540
 I won't rap it either.

266
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,340
 But let's look at this song that she sings.

267
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,140
 What do we see in this song?

268
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,460
 We see that it is very scriptural, very scriptural.

269
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,340
 Can you imagine, like, our tightest 14-year-old kids coming out

270
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,900
 and singing these songs, these type of songs?

271
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,180
 It would be amazing, very amazing.

272
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,140
 We see a lot of Old Testament scripture.

273
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,460
 Firstly, in verse 46, she says, "My soul magnifies the Lord."

274
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,380
 It's very similar to Psalm 34, verse 6.

275
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,780
 "O, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together."

276
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:17,260
 In verse 47, it says, "And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior."

277
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:29,740
 In Isaiah 45, it says, "There is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Savior."

278
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,220
 In verse 48, "For he has looked on the humble estate of his servant."

279
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,580
 It's very similar to what Hannah said in 1 Samuel.

280
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,500
 She made a vow saying, "O Lord, if you would only look on your servant's misery

281
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:52,900
 and remember me, and not forget your servant, but give her a son."

282
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:01,420
 There's, if you look closely, there's around 15 different scriptural references.

283
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,460
 And what does that tell you about Mary?

284
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,980
 That she must have really paid attention in Titus Fellowship,

285
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,340
 when Pastor Johnny was talking about the Old Testament.

286
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,660
 We see Psalms, we see the Prophet Isaiah book being read out,

287
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,140
 we see Samuel being read out.

288
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,740
 She must have really understood the Bible or the Old Testament back then.

289
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,220
 She was scriptural.

290
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:41,860
 She was worshipping the Lord out of the joy that comes from her heart.

291
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,740
 And what comes out of her heart?

292
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:52,500
 Scripture, the Bible, the Old Testament, the laws, the Psalms.

293
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,100
 Beautiful.

294
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,980
 Beautiful.

295
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:05,940
 And lastly, we see she goes from deliverer to delivered.

296
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,340
 Deliverer to delivered.

297
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,460
 Now, there's many misconceptions or misunderstandings about Mary.

298
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,940
 There's a couple I would like to mention tonight.

299
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:35,140
 And some Catholics and some Orthodox sections of Christianity

300
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,500
 believe these things about Mary.

301
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,380
 And I would like to explain them to you.

302
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,540
 The first thing is the Immaculate Conception.

303
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,660
 Immaculate Conception.

304
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,500
 And this says that Mary is without sin.

305
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:59,260
 Mary conceived Jesus and Jesus had a perfect birth with a perfect mother.

306
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,980
 And that she is without sin.

307
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,220
 She has no original sin.

308
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,860
 And she lived a sinless life.

309
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:12,020
 That's the first sort of misunderstanding we have of Mary,

310
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,220
 or people had of Mary.

311
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:23,540
 Now, the Bible says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

312
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:29,540
 It doesn't say, "For all have sinned except Mary."

313
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,620
 It doesn't say that.

314
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:38,860
 The second thing that people have a misunderstanding of is perpetual virginity.

315
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,700
 So she remained a virgin the rest of her life.

316
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,660
 Let's read Mark 6 3 together.

317
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,260
 One, two, three.

318
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:55,300
 "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joseph and Judah and Simon?

319
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
 And are not his sisters here with us?"

320
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,980
 And they took offense at him.

321
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,380
 Jesus had brothers and sisters according to the Gospels.

322
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:14,620
 And so Mary probably was not a virgin for the rest of her life.

323
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,940
 Okay.

324
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,260
 The next misunderstanding we have of Mary is bodily assumption.

325
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,060
 Bodily assumption says that she never died.

326
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,460
 She was raised.

327
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,940
 Who were the two people that were raised to heaven that did not die in the Bible?

328
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,060
 You guys, Elijah and Enoch.

329
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,580
 Apparently, some people think there's a third and it is Mary.

330
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,220
 And that is also a misunderstanding.

331
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:54,060
 And the last one that is also the most disturbing one is that he is a co-mediator with Christ.

332
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,100
 She is a co-mediator with Christ.

333
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:04,660
 And what that means is that not only did Jesus die on the Christ and he is the high priest

334
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,220
 and sacrifice for our sins.

335
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,100
 As you see in the next picture, Mary is also on there.

336
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:23,580
 She is dying with Jesus on the cross and she also takes part in this sacrifice.

337
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,060
 And obviously, we do not believe this.

338
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:36,700
 We believe that Mary was just like any human person.

339
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,900
 We believe she wasn't sinless.

340
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,660
 She was learning about God.

341
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,180
 She was learning to be a parent just like us.

342
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,460
 She was not sinless.

343
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,860
 She did not die with Christ on the cross for our sins.

344
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:03,460
 It is only Jesus because Jesus is God, the second person of the Trinity.

345
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:10,140
 It was the Holy Spirit that overshadowed and empowered her so that she would conceive,

346
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,460
 not the power of Mary.

347
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:23,140
 It was the power of the Holy Spirit working, overshadowing her.

348
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:30,260
 Jesus Christ died for our sins once and for all time.

349
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:42,220
 He alone can save us because he is fully man and fully God.

350
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,260
 Let's read this part of her song once again.

351
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:57,500
 And Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior,

352
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:05,100
 for he has looked on my humble estate, on the humble estate of his servant."

353
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,580
 Who needs a Savior?

354
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,940
 Who needs a Savior?

355
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,420
 We all do.

356
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,540
 Because we have sin.

357
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,740
 We can't save ourselves.

358
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,260
 No matter how hard we try, no matter how hard we go and try to fix the things that are wrong

359
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,660
 with us, we still have sin.

360
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,260
 And Mary said this.

361
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,140
 Mary said, "In God, my Savior."

362
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:42,700
 She also needed a Savior.

363
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,180
 The lyrics of "Mary, Did You Know" say this.

364
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:54,740
 Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?

365
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:03,220
 This child that you delivered will soon deliver you.

366
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,700
 This child that you delivered will soon deliver you.

367
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,340
 Amazing, amazing song.

368
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,940
 We see Mary from unknown to favored by God.

369
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,740
 And favored by God, it doesn't mean, oh, you're gonna have a beautiful house on the peak

370
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,940
 and 10 cars and four children and send them all to abroad

371
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,580
 and they're gonna all live happily ever after.

372
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,220
 It doesn't mean that.

373
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,820
 'Cause we see Mary, she had some of the best, best times.

374
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,580
 She experienced the birth of Christ.

375
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:51,500
 Did she also experience some of the hardest times?

376
00:26:51,500 --> 00:27:02,060
 Seeing her son beaten, scorned, humiliated, nailed to a cross.

377
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:10,620
 It's a very hard thing to see your child being favored.

378
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:18,580
 It means obeying the Lord in where He has called you.

379
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,540
 We see that Mary was favored.

380
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:28,300
 She was faithful to what God has called her to.

381
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:34,420
 She wasn't, as we see in the next couple of chapters, you know, she lost Jesus for a couple

382
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,620
 of days.

383
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,660
 She was also learning how to be a parent to a perfect child.

384
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
 She was learning.

385
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,980
 She was teachable.

386
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,900
 She was faithful.

387
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:58,940
 An incredible woman, incredible little girl who obeyed the Lord, who did what the Lord

388
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,020
 asked and was faithful to her task.

389
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:12,840
 And as the band comes up, I want to invite us to think about what has the Lord called

390
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,240
 us to?

391
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,800
 What has the Lord called us to?

392
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:26,940
 Are we faithful to what the Lord has called us to?

393
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:36,060
 The Lord asked Mary to conceive the Savior of the world, the Messiah in her womb.

394
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:42,940
 And the Lord also asks of us that we have the Messiah inside of us and we should share

395
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:49,220
 His light and His love to the world.

396
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
 Are we willing?

397
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,100
 What has God called you to?

398
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:05,220
 Are you willing to be faithful, obedient, to be favored and blessed by the Lord?

399
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,700
 Let us pray.

400
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:16,940
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for the story of Mary, a beautiful, innocent girl, unknown

401
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,640
 but favored by the Lord.

402
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:31,260
 She was fearful at first at the message, but she stood in courage and in faithfulness to

403
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,920
 her calling.

404
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:46,220
 She went from silence to praise, praising you with the scripture that filled her heart.

405
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,320
 She went from virgin to the mother of the Most High.

406
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,740
 What an honor it was for her.

407
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,620
 We thank you for who Mary is.

408
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,340
 We thank you for her example of obedience, of faithfulness.

409
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,820
 We ask that Lord you would give us the courage to do the same.

410
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:20,420
 Bless us Lord this Christmas to spread your love and your light to those around us.

411
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,700
 In Christ's name we pray.

412
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,300
 Amen.
