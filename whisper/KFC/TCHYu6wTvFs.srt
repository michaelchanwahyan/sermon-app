1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,160
 Good evening everybody and the first thing I want to say is a big. Thank you

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,680
 These last few weeks have not been easy for Sandra and I we actually have four

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,520
 Relatives who are shall I say on the final lap of their life?

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,480
 We don't know how long that laps going to be my two sisters my brother-in-law and in particular Sandra's father

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,360
 We almost didn't come back and it was a nip and tuck decision

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,220
 But I'm so pleased to be here with you. It's good to be back. I've really missed you

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:43,840
 I've missed preaching and you know, it's I want to encourage you though. I have two weeks. I I preached in Wales and

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,420
 I preached

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,260
 sermons from our church together series the Spirit-filled Church and the Kingdom Church and

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,720
 They liked it so much. They made it into a

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,380
 Small group material so they've got their own their own clan material out out of our sermon

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,800
 so what I'm gonna say just like the Alpha little acorns right growing into big trees and

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,600
 This alpha this time. It's been very small, but actually it's an acorn and

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,240
 It's great when churches around the world are doing

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,240
 Small group serious based on on our material here. So well done everybody

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,920
 But I'm back to the eight five two. I've loved the one Corinthian series and

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,400
 I want to thank Michelle twice Johnny not forgetting pastor Steve. That was amazing and

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,680
 I can't forget you Julie that that week on missions was incredible and

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,180
 We've been watching each week live and it's been amazing to see what God has been doing through this series

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,600
 And this is my first chance to speak on one Corinthians

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,840
 I'm grateful to bring this sermon

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,760
 It's it's track five in the one Corinthians series and it's on order in the church

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,940
 Now you might think this is a subject that is not a natural fit for me

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,880
 order in the church

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,060
 Let's be honest

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,220
 I'm often seen in church circles as a bit of a maverick

28
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,840
 Always seemingly pushing conventional boundaries

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,640
 I've put some pictures up just from here from KFC. I but I mean how many churches in the world? Do you know?

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,360
 When you talk about the kingdom of God, we did it with Lego sets. Do you remember that? We did the Lego building, you know

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
 how many churches in the world have

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,360
 Something like g5 series, you know where where our speakers are in their 20s and their 30s. Sorry Anthony

33
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,440
 But

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,000
 It was amazing, you know to see Bonnie and Gabe and Paul and Anthony speak to us in the g5

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
 How many churches when they do the armor of God?

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,880
 Demonstrate it in this way. Do you remember that? We're Chloe

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,320
 How many churches have a gender reveal in the service look?

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
 And

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,640
 I've even been known to preach

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,120
 With plastic fruit when we did the don't allow the enemy a seat at your table. I

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:26,120
 Guess you can say that I've sometimes well, maybe more than sometimes push the envelope

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,280
 Perhaps I should give you some background to that. See I I grew up

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,960
 I went to strict Anglican schools from from primary school to secondary school. I had to go assembly every day of the week

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,960
 I calculated that's over two thousand assemblies

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,560
 The only exception was the special days when we went to church like Saints days

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,800
 And I've got to be honest. It was kind of boring

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,280
 No, no, no, no. No. No, it was very boring and

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,760
 I

49
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,240
 Remember back. I think it was in I was 10 as 19. Yeah, they're right

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,600
 They're about I was 10 years of age and I just had a birthday and someone had just given me a football diary a soccer

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,320
 Diary for for those Americans and you know

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,840
 And I decided it would be far more interesting for me in church to read my football diary

53
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,360
 Than to to listen to the church service

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
 my headmaster didn't agree and

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,840
 Took me back to school gave me two strokes of the cane and for many years

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,440
 I thought of thought is God like that is God like a headmaster waiting to to give you the cane when you do

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,240
 Something wrong and as a result of this and other experiences

58
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,720
 I've become a strong opponent of

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
 legalism in the church and

60
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,440
 Have seen and spoken of the danger. You will have heard me of

61
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,720
 exalting the law of Moses above the grace of Jesus

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,040
 but actually I

63
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
 am a champion of

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,680
 church order or

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
 Should I say?

66
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
 biblical

67
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 church order and

68
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,640
 Current one Corinthians is an ideal place to start to see what scripture has to say

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,680
 about this important subject I

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,680
 Mean to be honest. I'm not a fan of

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,600
 The free-for-all that I see in many so-called modern churches

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 They often use the expression

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,720
 You've heard it as the spirit leads

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
 but actually

75
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,160
 why a

76
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,680
 hundred-percent support this sentiment I

77
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,600
 believe it is used as an excuse as much as a theological statement and

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,800
 The Apostle Paul would seem to agree with me

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,560
 the church in Corinth

80
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,400
 had become a decidedly as the spirit leads fellowship and

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,000
 It ended up quite frankly as a mess and I have witnessed this in

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,960
 churches even in modern times I

83
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,080
 Will cover the use of spiritual gifts in a future talk

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,500
 But it is the misuse of spiritual gifts, which has led to most of the Corinthian churches

85
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,520
 issues

86
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,200
 And my guiding verse for this evening's talk is this one Corinthians 1440. I've put it on the screen

87
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,760
 But all things should be done

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,160
 decently and

89
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
 In order, let me say it again

90
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,560
 But all things should be done

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,920
 decently and

92
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
 in order

93
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,640
 The problem with this is that one man's definition of decently and in order will vary from another

94
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,220
 That is maybe why we have close to 50,000 Christian denominations today

95
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,140
 so what I want to try to do is to put aside pastor John's version of

96
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,860
 decently and in order and

97
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,460
 attempt to see what the Bible says as

98
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,120
 described in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians

99
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,060
 in fact several of the Bible's principles of order within the church and

100
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,660
 Perhaps some of the most important ones are found in the book of one Corinthians

101
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,220
 This evening I'm going to address these particular matters

102
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,520
 to show that what we do as a church and

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,900
 How we do them are not arbitrary at all

104
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,620
 They are based on

105
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,820
 legitimate religious authority

106
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,900
 It's

107
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,940
 impossible to read the book of one Corinthians as we've been doing each week and not see Paul's

108
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,460
 Authority coming through now the amazing thing is

109
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,240
 He was almost certainly writing this in

110
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,740
 Ephesus

111
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
 Which was 300?

112
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:23,100
 Miles or so away. It's like me preaching this sermon tonight, but being in Hainan Island right exactly the same and

113
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,860
 Yet he was 300 miles away, but he was

114
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:35,180
 unquestionably still in charge still despite being separated by all this distance

115
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,780
 He was the one in charge of this church and this comes through in his writing. Look at this

116
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,940
 with a few strokes of the pen

117
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
 Though a few hundred miles away

118
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,300
 He does this he dis dis fellow

119
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,620
 Disfellowships a man who was sleeping with his father's wife. He gives instructions and direction like a general

120
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,220
 commanding his officers

121
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,900
 He also gives orders concerning judging

122
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,580
 lawsuits

123
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,820
 fornication marriage and divorce meets offer to idols

124
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:17,660
 idolatry the Lord's Supper preaching church services taking up a collection for the Jerusalem Saints and the way the

125
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,500
 Corinthians need to treat the ministry

126
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,300
 Paul's epistle is just chock full of

127
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,500
 instructions commands and orders

128
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:37,620
 Only a person who is dimwitted or intentionally blind would fail to see the authority in Paul's writing

129
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
 Paul's instruction on

130
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,020
 administration within the church are primarily in four chapters

131
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,900
 namely 9 11 12 and 14

132
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,420
 Although there are bits and pieces in various other sections

133
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,980
 these particular chapters covered the subjects of

134
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,100
 ministerial prerogatives

135
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,220
 privileges and rights

136
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,260
 the principle of headship

137
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,660
 the conduct of the Lord's Supper which we call communion the

138
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,100
 organized division of labor within the church and the order in church services I

139
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,580
 Will cover the last one in my talk on spiritual gifts in two weeks time

140
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,260
 Today, I will look at the other four

141
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,540
 Now you may feel these are all pretty

142
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,340
 fairly basic subjects

143
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,060
 But we must remember that there are four

144
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,220
 We must remember that the church in Corinth was a very young church

145
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,620
 It was by this time, maybe only five years old

146
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,540
 That's younger than KFC. I

147
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,780
 And it may have been less than that

148
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,300
 Accordingly they did not have a great church background

149
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,060
 some of them may have been Jews and had background in the synagogue and

150
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,100
 Some of these things may be brought from there

151
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,980
 Not all of them were though

152
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,660
 We have to remember where Corinth was and the makeup of its residents

153
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,860
 Where they were all from and the backgrounds they had

154
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,620
 Paul was trying desperately and an entirely new situation to bring order out of chaos

155
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:31,180
 to get people from Egypt Judea Asia Minor Europe and wherever else the people came from

156
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,980
 To all do and speak the same thing

157
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,300
 It was an enormous task it was enormous task to ask people to turn the cell phones off

158
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,340
 Paul never had cell phones in those days. I'm sure I

159
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,700
 Understand this I used to be pastor the vine and in the vine at time we had 55 different first languages

160
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,060
 It's difficult to bring them all together

161
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,780
 The first thing that Paul did of course

162
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,100
 Was to set down who was in charge

163
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,740
 He was

164
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,940
 From there they could work out the details

165
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:18,980
 There were problems in the Corinthian Church and they had been reported to Paul the situation was becoming worse

166
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,460
 Remember there were various factions

167
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,740
 We saw a few weeks ago for one said I follow Paul and another one says I follow a polis

168
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,820
 Are you not mere human beings?

169
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:38,300
 Paul thought the best thing to do in this situation was to set down plain and

170
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,340
 Understandable directions and that is exactly what he does in one Corinthians

171
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,580
 What we're going to do today is we're going to take an overview of these four major sections

172
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,740
 We're not going to try and go through every little detail because that would take too many sermons and I want to do this in only

173
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,780
 one

174
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,780
 Therefore if it's okay with you

175
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:08,540
 We will take the highlights out of this to allow you to understand the principles from which Paul was working

176
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,420
 And I've taught the first section

177
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,100
 ministerial authority rights and privilege

178
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:24,020
 Paul clearly wrote 1 Corinthians 9 because he felt

179
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,980
 defensive about his own position

180
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,100
 The reports he had received from those who had come from Corinth

181
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,300
 Included some that were very critical of Paul himself

182
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,740
 And we get so much of this in the modern church as well

183
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:49,400
 In other places it talks about how Paul sounded strong in his letters, but in person was rather weak

184
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,540
 He came across strong in those epistles, but when they saw him in person he was not what they expected

185
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,660
 Perhaps he seemed to be a pushover

186
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,820
 Paul's speech may even have had a lisp or stutter

187
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,780
 things they continued consider contemptible

188
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:18,060
 So Paul was feeling a bit defensive and he felt like he needed to set the record straight

189
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
 Paul

190
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,700
 Could not win

191
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:32,740
 He went into Corinth he decided not to take their tithes and to work for himself making tents

192
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,820
 We do not know for sure if he was married, but if he were he did not bring her along

193
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,580
 He brought no one with him as far as we know here

194
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:48,220
 He decided to do these things to help persuade them to the gospel

195
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,420
 Because he did not want to appear demanding things of them

196
00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:00,660
 He did all of this out of the goodness of his heart trying to be a good example to them and it all got

197
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,060
 thrown back into his face

198
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,220
 Paul you are not a biggest person in this church as you say you are

199
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,900
 You do not have the authority you claim

200
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,220
 Paul then has to set the matter straight

201
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,580
 And in defending himself he explains the principles behind the authority he has

202
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:29,300
 As we start you'll notice from this chapter 9 notice the rhetorical questions he asked here

203
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,980
 rhetorical questions are questions that do not expect an answer

204
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,860
 Here we go 1 Corinthians 9

205
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,180
 Am I not free

206
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,660
 What he was?

207
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,660
 Am I not an apostle?

208
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,020
 Course he was have I not seen Jesus our Lord. He did

209
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,620
 Are you not my workmanship in the Lord?

210
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,780
 He then goes on

211
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,260
 If to others I am NOT an apostle

212
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,100
 At least I am to you

213
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,180
 For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. This is my defense to those who would examine me

214
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,540
 Do we not have the right to eat and drink?

215
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,820
 Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife or

216
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,780
 Do the other apostles and brothers of the Lord and Cephas or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to?

217
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,460
 refrain from working for a living

218
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,540
 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense?

219
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit and who tends a flock without getting some of its milk?

220
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,820
 Do I say these things on human authority

221
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,820
 Does not the law say the same for it is written in the law of Moses?

222
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,460
 You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain. Is it for oxen that God is concerned?

223
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,260
 Does he certainly not speak for our sake it was written for our sake?

224
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,700
 Because the plowman should plow in hope and the fresher fresh in hope of sharing in the crop if

225
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,780
 We have so spiritual things among you

226
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:18,260
 Is it too much if we reap material things from you if others share this rightful claim on you? Do we not even more?

227
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,060
 Nevertheless we have not made use of this right

228
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:28,460
 But we endure anything rather than put up an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ

229
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,860
 Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple?

230
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:40,900
 And those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings in the same way the Lord

231
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,580
 Commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel

232
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:54,380
 Interesting Paul's teaching style very infantile. It's the same way you teach a little child

233
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,020
 Do you know what this thing is? Yeah, this is one thing one. Do you know what the other one is?

234
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,940
 This is another one you put them together. How many do you have to?

235
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,180
 This is the way Paul is doing this. Am I not free?

236
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:16,540
 Point number one. Am I not an apostle point number two? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord point number three

237
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,080
 Are you not my work in the Lord point number four?

238
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,500
 He is just putting point after point after point

239
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:32,300
 Leading them to an obvious conclusion and the bottom line and the conclusion is in verse 14

240
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,660
 Those who proclaim the gospel

241
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:43,540
 Should get their living by the gospel that is the end of the matter for him. However

242
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:52,700
 The key word in this whole passage this whole section is translated into English as right or power

243
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,620
 Verse 4 do we not have the right to eat or drink?

244
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,980
 But this word actually means the authority to do something

245
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,780
 rather than the brute strength

246
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,380
 Authority has more to do with freedom and the right to do something

247
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:22,540
 This word can be translated a right authority power freedom privilege to leave permission power of rule or government

248
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,380
 It can be translated any one of those ways and even some others

249
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,580
 What he is saying throughout this whole chapter is the Paul

250
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,900
 Certainly have permission from Christ to do these things if he should need to

251
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,500
 They are part of the package of being a minister and certainly of being an apostle. I

252
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,140
 Have the awesome privilege of

253
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,220
 Fellowshipping with hundreds of pastors and ministers here in Hong Kong and around the world

254
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:03,180
 I've been honored and pastor Wayne's been part of this to host our international pastors breakfast here in Hong Kong for more than 15 years

255
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:09,740
 But what I've seen is that many ministers across the globe are

256
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,540
 Overworked

257
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,500
 Underpaid and

258
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,060
 undervalued I

259
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,900
 Have seen church leaders treated so badly in many cases in a way

260
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,980
 You would not even expect the secular world to treat its people. I could tell you some horror stories

261
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,300
 but I

262
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,460
 Have on the other hand

263
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,900
 seen church leaders

264
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,180
 Abuse their positions and cross the line from a perceived God-given right

265
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,660
 to an abuse of position and power

266
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
 Let's be clear

267
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,700
 Neither is correct and

268
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,940
 Paul is saying that in this chapter

269
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:02,420
 Christ gives his ministry authority within the church, which includes preaching teaching

270
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,380
 Organizing having a wife supported through contributions

271
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,700
 Paul's example however

272
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:18,060
 means that ministers must never abuse their authority by any means so as to bring glory to God and

273
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,980
 Praise no hindrance to the preaching of the gospel. I

274
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,660
 Need to move on get off my high horse the next session. I've entitled leadership

275
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,260
 headship or

276
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,140
 hierarchy

277
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,740
 Paul started off like this be imitators of me as I am of Christ

278
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
 That must have spurred a thought in him

279
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:47,420
 Because then he says now I commend you because you remember me and everything and maintain the traditions

280
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,980
 Even as I deliver them to you

281
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,180
 But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ

282
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,180
 The head of a wife is our husband and the head of Christ is God

283
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:06,460
 I'm gonna skip the portion the 12 verses regarding head coverings and hair lengths. Brian you're safe. It's okay

284
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,020
 But I want you to look at this only a joke I

285
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,260
 think

286
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,820
 If anyone is inclined to be contentious

287
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,580
 We have no such practice

288
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:29,860
 Nor do the churches of God. I want to go back to verse 1 be imitators of me as I am of Christ

289
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:36,980
 He said imitate the Apostle as he follows Christ leads that in itself is hierarchy

290
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
 The Apostle is under Christ

291
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:45,620
 He then says in verse to maintain the traditions even as I deliver them to you

292
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:52,060
 In verse 3 he says in effect. There is a natural God ordained order authority

293
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,460
 There is God the Father there's Christ the Son there is man. There is woman and

294
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,220
 The full thing in verse 16 if anyone is inclined to be contentious

295
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,780
 We have no such practice

296
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,780
 Nor to the churches of God

297
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,500
 This is important

298
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,820
 One person's contentions are

299
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:21,820
 Not enough to overturn the long-standing practices of the Church of God

300
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,100
 I need to say this we get a lot this in church, right?

301
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,300
 one person's contentions one person's whim is

302
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,420
 Not enough to overturn the long-standing practices of the Church of God

303
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,740
 We need to be aware of the flavor of the month

304
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,580
 The flavor of the month in church and jump into the latest fad or fashion

305
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,300
 What the Apostle Paul is talking about

306
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,660
 Just because one person wants to introduce something that they may think is a good idea

307
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:06,460
 We should not make the change if it contradicts what has been traditional in the church and cannot be proven to be any better

308
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,580
 We've had many contentions

309
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,660
 over this principle headship leadership

310
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,580
 hierarchy

311
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,340
 But Paul states it clearly and unequivocally as a matter of fact in the next chapter

312
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,700
 He gives a kind of org chart for the Church of God

313
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:33,700
 1 Corinthians 12 28 and God has placed in the church first of all Apostles secondly prophets third teachers

314
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:41,380
 They're miracles then gifts of healing of helping of guidance and of different kinds of tongue. He has given us a ranking

315
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,980
 From top to bottom of authority of power and importance. This is repeated in Ephesians 4

316
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:56,240
 Now what this organizational chart does what this stacking of leadership on level that will fraud he does is to provide

317
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
 organization

318
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,660
 It provides order within the church a

319
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,140
 Tool that God has used from the very beginning

320
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,260
 In fact in 1 Timothy 2 Paul reaches back to Adam and Eve

321
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:18,900
 The man was created first and then the woman to show the proof that this is the way that God works

322
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:27,540
 Everywhere in the Old Testament is the same it worked for the patriarchs it worked for Moses and Joshua

323
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:33,940
 For David and the Kings Elijah and Elisha as well as it worked for the Apostles in the New Testament

324
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,900
 It is a consistent way that God works

325
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,660
 If we go to John 14 28 we see that Jesus

326
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,140
 recognizes the same thing for himself when he says

327
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,380
 the Father

328
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,380
 Is greater than I?

329
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
 There is a chain of command

330
00:25:53,180 --> 00:26:04,100
 Jesus proceeds from the father the Holy Spirit proceeds from Jesus. There is a chain of command since God finds that this works

331
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,300
 He has put it in the church

332
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:15,180
 And one of the things I'm so grateful for us at KFC and KFC I is our deacons here

333
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:23,540
 You know, I've never in my years in the church known a group of deacons who've been more committed

334
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:31,100
 To the body of Christ who've worked so hard for the body of Christ and I I'm just so grateful

335
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,700
 That we have these men and women

336
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,740
 who fearlessly tirelessly

337
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,940
 support us and

338
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,820
 I'm so glad that we've got this order this authority in the church

339
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,580
 Now it doesn't mean there won't be any hurt feelings

340
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,500
 It doesn't mean there won't be any kind of discipline

341
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,580
 However, if it is done for love

342
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:05,420
 It's gonna produce what God intended it to produce

343
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,020
 And can I just say I've never found a church fellowship as loving as this one

344
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,980
 This is a loving fellowship if this is done in love

345
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,620
 if

346
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,860
 We use this principle the best interest of the church could be served

347
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:27,380
 So I want to assert some of this section the principle of headship

348
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,820
 provides

349
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
 organization within the church and

350
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,620
 enforces God's righteous standards

351
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,380
 within the church

352
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,220
 The next section concerns the Lord's Supper, which we call communion

353
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,420
 It says here

354
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:50,140
 The way that the Corinthian Church was observing the Lord's Supper was for the worse

355
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:57,700
 It was divisive. It was unloving it was self-serving and as Paul sums it up. It was unworthy

356
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,620
 Let's read it

357
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,980
 But in the following instructions

358
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,580
 I do not commend you because when you come together is not a place for the better

359
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,980
 But for the worse for in the first place when you come together as a church

360
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,980
 I hear there are divisions among you and I believe it in part

361
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,820
 For there may be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be

362
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,620
 recognized

363
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:31,220
 In verse 20 when they came together to observe the festival. It was not to keep the Lord's Supper

364
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,380
 It was something very different. Let's read it when you come together

365
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,740
 It's not the Lord's Supper you're eating for an eating each one goes ahead of his own meal one goes hungry

366
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,180
 another gets drunk

367
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,100
 The way he goes on to explain it is almost like some pagan right they were doing

368
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,060
 They were getting drunk

369
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,860
 It was BYOB and happy hour rolled into one

370
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,260
 They brought more than one bottle of communion wine, I guess

371
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:09,300
 What they were calling the Lord's Supper was unfair because some could eat and some could not some got drunk and some did not

372
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,060
 They were actually shaming those who did not have the means to eat with them

373
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:19,420
 Remember this city was in many ways like Hong Kong

374
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,500
 very diverse

375
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,780
 With very poor people and very rich people

376
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,380
 There were Egyptians Jews Syrians and more from all over the Mediterranean

377
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,180
 All with different customs who brought their ideas into the Church of God

378
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,700
 evidently all mixed together

379
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:46,820
 They were having this out and out knees up to the point that people were actually getting drunk

380
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:54,180
 During what should have been the communion service. I think I'm quite glad we have grape juice

381
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,940
 What

382
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,340
 Paul essentially says is their practice was dishonoring Christ in the worst way his supreme sacrifice

383
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,220
 Does not seem to have been entered into their thinking at all. He had to remind them

384
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,060
 Look, this is why we come together for the Lord's Supper is the honor Christ

385
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,500
 He's to take the bread and remember his body and his take the wine

386
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,820
 I remember he shed blood and all the things that go with it

387
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,320
 He was telling them it was to be a sober evening in more ways than one. He had to lay the Lord down to them

388
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,340
 He told them that if they were spiritually discerning really spiritually discerning they would know better

389
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,540
 But they were such carnal people. He had to command them and judge them

390
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,220
 Look how he concludes this section

391
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,820
 So then brothers when you come together to eat wait for one another if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home

392
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,960
 So when you come together, it will not be for judgment

393
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,900
 About the other things I will give direction

394
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,460
 when I come in

395
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,620
 summary

396
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,120
 The church should not treat the Lord's Supper like a potluck

397
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,860
 or a feast

398
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,840
 When we take communion it is a sober commemoration of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and should be

399
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,100
 Observed with the respect it deserves

400
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
 My last section is

401
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,700
 entitled organization and

402
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,060
 Division of labor within the church. I gotta tell you we could do a whole series on this one

403
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,260
 I hope you're not rushing off afterwards

404
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,660
 Look at these verses from 1 Corinthians 12

405
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,500
 For just as the body is

406
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,900
 One and has many members and all the members of the body low many are one body. So it is with Christ

407
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:52,080
 For in one spirit, we were all baptized into one body Jews and Greeks slaves and frees and we're all made to drink of the one

408
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,460
 spirit

409
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:59,140
 Verse 18, but as it is God arranged the members of the body each one of them as he chose

410
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,340
 verse 27 now you are the body of Christ and

411
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,260
 individually members of it

412
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:13,340
 Paul uses the analogy of the body to show how the church is organized and how is directed

413
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,380
 The body yours mine everybody's is directed by the head

414
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:24,980
 All the functions of the body begin in the mind and go through the nerves to the rest of the body and those parts perform

415
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,380
 their functions

416
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,020
 the body of Christ is the same way he is the head and

417
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:35,260
 He sends orders through his Holy Spirit to the rest of the body

418
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:42,900
 Since those are in his body have the Holy Spirit and can receive and be inspired by the Holy Spirit

419
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,100
 Those members do what Christ tells them to do

420
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,560
 Everything works together because we are all working towards the same goal

421
00:32:51,560 --> 00:33:00,140
 Paul says here putting it in my own words that the body of Christ is a spiritual organism

422
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:06,220
 Every part has a place and a function every part has a place and a function and he

423
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:14,060
 Emphasizes that these places and these functions are determined by God the Father himself and are directed by Jesus Christ himself

424
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,380
 They are involved

425
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:23,520
 The father puts us where he wants us and then Jesus Christ says, okay dad. I can use this person and he gives his orders

426
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,580
 No person is

427
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,580
 Unneeded if God has put him into the body of Christ

428
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,500
 To sum up this section the Church of God is

429
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:45,220
 Organized by God under Christ to fulfill God's purpose in the church each member each member

430
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:51,220
 Each member has a place and a function that are necessary to reach the goal

431
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,940
 Wherever we have been placed

432
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,220
 We should be content

433
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,820
 I'll say that again

434
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,260
 Wherever we have been placed

435
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,300
 We should be content if we desire something more we need to wait for God's providence

436
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,500
 But in the meantime

437
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,060
 Continue working but

438
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,700
 Where I started

439
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,740
 But all things should be done decently

440
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,060
 and

441
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
 in order

442
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
 This verse comes as Paul

443
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,740
 concludes his focus on

444
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,700
 spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 14 by

445
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:45,140
 Encouraging the whole church to come to worship ready to contribute

446
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:50,340
 But to do so in an orderly way

447
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,940
 So that people can be edified and

448
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,340
 built up in their faith

449
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,380
 Can I ask the worship band to come back and I'll sort of stand please

450
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:11,580
 What is it

451
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:26,620
 I'm desperate for us to be the church that Christ wants us to not just for us

452
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
 But for our city for our world

453
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,940
 You may have noticed we're in a mess

454
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,300
 Governments all around the world are in a mess

455
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,500
 We're gonna sing this song heal our land it's a prayer I

456
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:55,060
 Want to pray for us before we sing I

457
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,500
 Want to really as it were complete this picture together

458
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:06,820
 Because it's not my words it's not a sermon

459
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:13,100
 We need the Spirit of God to come upon the church

460
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:20,660
 To heal us there are so many divisions in the body of Christ I

461
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,780
 Said earlier, that's why we got 50,000 denominations

462
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,780
 50,000 I

463
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:35,740
 Say so many times you've heard me said there's only one church in Hong Kong Church of Jesus Christ

464
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:43,740
 We're gonna pray now Spirit of God fall on your church

465
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,460
 Pour out your presence

466
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,660
 Bible says if my people will call by my name will humble themselves and pray I will hear their prayer. I

467
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,340
 Will come from heaven and I will heal their land

468
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,240
 So I'm gonna ask you before we sing just to stretch your hands out in front of you

469
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:17,120
 When I asked the Holy Spirit to come to us we need this the church in Hong Kong needs this

470
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,140
 Father we thank you for the church. We thank you for the church you

471
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,780
 Ordained we thank you Lord for the way you spoke about order in the church

472
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,420
 We thank you for this body

473
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:43,660
 Thank you for our deacons I thank you for pastor Peter I thank you for those who

474
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,700
 Have served this church for more than 35 years

475
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
 I

476
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,780
 Just see us here in Admiralty in this place I

477
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:05,700
 See us as beacon I see us as a lighthouse for this city I

478
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:12,820
 Don't want to take it for granted where we are here, but God has put us here for a purpose

479
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,860
 Lord in a city, which is so divided

480
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,620
 Politically socially economically

481
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,780
 For families that are divided

482
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:36,940
 We say Lord would you pour out your spirit on this land

483
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:44,580
 Would you start with us Lord we are open to receive we are open to be used

484
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,060
 Pour out your spirit on this church we pray

485
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:57,260
 Pour out your spirit on our leaders on our helpers

486
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:07,500
 I

487
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,780
 Pray Lord that we would become the church that you saw

488
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:21,260
 In your mind on that day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came and lit the flame and the church began

489
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:32,740
 May we be that church and may we be a beacon here for the people of this city and this nation

490
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,420
 In Jesus name

491
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,220
 Let's sing this song heal our land

492
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,800
 (gentle music)

493
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,860
 you
