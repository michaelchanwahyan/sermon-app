1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
 - And good evening, everybody, and good evening to those who've chosen to watch in the dry

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,320
 at home, in your own home.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,560
 You're welcome here with us.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:22,120
 I get the privilege to kick off this new series, Church Together.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,200
 It's a series that I am particularly excited about.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:36,760
 Now you know, yes, I'm always really excited, but I am really excited about these next six

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,640
 weeks.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:47,240
 I remember speaking here, well, I think it was on Zoom about 18 months ago, and I was

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,880
 commenting about people who were saying to me, "I can't wait to get back to church."

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
 Have you heard that, right?

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,080
 "I can't wait to get back to church," as we were doing Zoom week after week.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:07,720
 And I remember saying to them, you'll remember this, "The church you want to get back to

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,920
 doesn't exist."

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:20,840
 As I encouraged the church to reset, renew, and revive.

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:31,400
 Eighteen months later, and five COVID waves later, what does the church look like?

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:46,040
 Well, church physical numbers worldwide are down 40 to 50%, but online numbers have literally

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,280
 soared.

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,680
 Churches have begun to take their focus on just their Sunday service or their Saturday

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,880
 service and began reaching out, feeding the poor, caring for those struggling with the

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,200
 physical, emotional, and practical strain of a world that was suddenly different, with

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:22,320
 war and hatred compounding the virus effects.

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,980
 In short, I believe this.

23
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:32,840
 We have begun to be the church rather than doing church.

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,980
 Let me say it again.

25
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:43,040
 We have begun to be the church instead of doing church.

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:52,280
 The pandemic seems to have taken particularly its toll on several so-called mega churches.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:01,680
 And what we've seen, haven't we, in our newspapers, high profile failures, including reported

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,600
 abuse of staff and congregation and serious moral failures that have been featured everywhere

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,440
 in the press and the social media.

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,560
 I'll be honest with you, this has really saddened me.

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,120
 So in response, I started to pray.

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,560
 I started to dialogue with other church leaders here in Hong Kong and around the world.

33
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,840
 And I waited on God.

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,480
 As I waited, this is what I believe God encouraged me with only about a month or so ago.

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,240
 I saw a picture of a chair with four legs.

36
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,720
 And I was led to the early church in Acts 2, the passage that Michelle just read, and

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,560
 sensed that God is raising up His church in this season to be the church He intended it

38
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,560
 to be.

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,000
 I've put a picture on the screen.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,440
 This is what I believe the churches look like.

41
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:22,880
 Historically, we as the worldwide church have tended to balance our churches on single legs,

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:35,880
 like great preaching, great worship, or even great venues, maybe even big donors.

43
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,000
 Now all this has been stripped away, maybe forever.

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,400
 And the four legs that I see are prayer, community, generosity, and the Word of God.

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,440
 I'll say that again.

46
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,080
 Prayer, community, generosity, and the Word of God.

47
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,560
 I believe that when these are aligned, when we have these four legs in place, evangelism

48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,960
 will flow.

49
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,560
 Perhaps I believe through the workplace, it's the only place where numbers can be added

50
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 daily.

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:27,520
 And I believe that God said this to me, "I am gonna turn the world's perceptions of church

52
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,600
 upside down."

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 Too often we've based our perception on the reputation of a pastor or a leader.

54
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,240
 And this has been flawed in recent times.

55
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,800
 Or by the size of a church's ministry.

56
00:05:49,800 --> 00:06:03,920
 From here on in, the success of the church shall be determined by the love of the people.

57
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,560
 John 13, 35.

58
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:17,400
 My friends, it is a new day and it is a new way.

59
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,080
 Welcome to our series.

60
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,040
 We are gonna focus on the early believers in Acts chapter 2 and spend some time over

61
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:38,920
 the next few weeks to look closely at them and how they did church.

62
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:48,160
 Acts 2 tells us how the Holy Spirit miraculously reversed the curse of Babel.

63
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,760
 Have you thought of that?

64
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:59,440
 The story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11 explains the origins of the multiplicity

65
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,800
 of languages.

66
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,840
 God was concerned that humans had blasphemed by building a huge tower.

67
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,160
 And when I say huge, it was apparently a reported 1.6 miles high.

68
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,920
 That's three times the height of the Burj Khalifa.

69
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,640
 And I've been to the top of Burj Khalifa.

70
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
 That's high.

71
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,200
 Why did they build it?

72
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,120
 To avoid a second flood.

73
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,640
 So God brought into existence multiple languages.

74
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:47,360
 And here we see that God reversed the curse of Babel and instead created a new community

75
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,160
 through the gospel.

76
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,040
 The picture we see of this first century AD community is a wonderful reminder of what

77
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,040
 church can be.

78
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,600
 Philip Yancey in his amazing book, I think it's one of my favorite books, "What's So

79
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,640
 Amazing About Grace?"

80
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,440
 He said this, "At the height of the Cold War, Billy Graham visited Russia to meet with their

81
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,640
 political and religious leaders.

82
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:29,440
 Many conservatives in the US criticized him for not taking a more prophetic role.

83
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,640
 One accused him of setting the church back 50 years."

84
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,680
 I love Billy Graham's response.

85
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,040
 He said, "Yeah, I'm deeply ashamed.

86
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:51,200
 I've been trying very hard to set the church back 2000 years."

87
00:08:51,200 --> 00:09:02,840
 And as it were, we are going back to the future, 2000 years and taking a look at this first

88
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,880
 church.

89
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,360
 What we notice first of all is this, we notice a healthy posture.

90
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,340
 I say a healthy posture because I wish I had one, right?

91
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:21,420
 Now a word of warning, we must not glamorize the early church.

92
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,180
 They had their own set of problems.

93
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,800
 A perfect church has never existed and never will.

94
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:40,340
 And another word of warning, being a Christian doesn't mean nostalgically looking back to

95
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,980
 the good old days.

96
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:55,300
 We can and we will look at how the early church related to God, to one another and to the

97
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
 world.

98
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,300
 And what we will find is a beautiful picture, a beautiful picture of how the church with

99
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:11,460
 all its imperfections can be a community like no other.

100
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:23,740
 Let's consider the three postures of the early church, inward, upward, and outward.

101
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,940
 The church had a healthy inward posture.

102
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:35,980
 Upon receiving baptism, these 3000 new believers immediately began devoting themselves to one

103
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,260
 another.

104
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,000
 This church had a healthy upward posture.

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,740
 This new community experienced God deeply.

106
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,800
 And the church had a healthy outward posture.

107
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,860
 This community not only moved toward God and knew each other well, but they also moved

108
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,140
 toward the world.

109
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:17,340
 The early church, though flawed, is a wonderful model for us.

110
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:25,260
 The way it emulated these postures is a challenge for all churches today and for us here at

111
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,360
 KFCI.

112
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,340
 So we will be examining these areas.

113
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:40,660
 We'll be asking hard questions and resting in the gospel to find strength and motivation

114
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,340
 to fulfill them.

115
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:53,900
 That's why Christ gave himself up to create a community like nothing the world has ever

116
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,740
 seen.

117
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:06,060
 May we be that community.

118
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:15,260
 But for today, by way of introduction, I want to set this in context.

119
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,300
 We sang the line, didn't we?

120
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,380
 And the church of Christ was born and the spirit lit the flame in the song, "King of

121
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,380
 Kings."

122
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,780
 I love this line.

123
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,980
 Every time I sing this line, it gives me goosebumps.

124
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,540
 The church of Christ was born and the spirit lit the flame.

125
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:45,420
 And Acts chapter 1 and chapter 2 tell the story of how the resurrected Jesus had ascended

126
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,700
 to the Father.

127
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:54,020
 So the promise of the Father, the precious Holy Spirit, would be poured out on the church,

128
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:02,180
 fulfilling the prophecy shared in the book of Joel centuries before.

129
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:09,740
 But what I want to do before we focus on Acts 2, 42 to 47, you're going to hear those verses

130
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,040
 quite a lot the next few weeks.

131
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,700
 What I want to do is to set the scene, as it were.

132
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:29,980
 As I reread chapters 1 and 2, I was reminded of four prerequisites to the birth of the

133
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,660
 early church.

134
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,100
 And they can be summarized in four words.

135
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,540
 And they are effectively the entry points for our series.

136
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:53,380
 And they are waiting, togetherness, receiving, and boldness.

137
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,020
 Let me say them again.

138
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,660
 Waiting, togetherness, receiving, and boldness.

139
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
 Let's look at them one at a time.

140
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
 Waiting.

141
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
 Who are we waiting on?

142
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,440
 Waiting on God, of course.

143
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,380
 In chapter 1, on one occasion while he was eating with them, he gave him this command.

144
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,260
 Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait.

145
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,140
 Wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.

146
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:29,020
 John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

147
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,460
 That word wait, I put the Greek up there, perimenein, is to wait for, to wait.

148
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,580
 None of us enjoy waiting, do we?

149
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:46,460
 Oh, what do you think about these telephone, hotlines, right?

150
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,800
 For English press, one, for Canadian press, two.

151
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
 What department do you want?

152
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 I've got no idea.

153
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,060
 One, two, three, four, five, six.

154
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,360
 And oh my goodness, if you want this and that.

155
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,740
 So many decisions and they're saying that.

156
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,300
 Eventually you get around to speak to a customer service representative, press zero.

157
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,100
 We all do that, right?

158
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:13,100
 Now it says, "Your customer service representative will be with you in a moment."

159
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,460
 Fifteen minutes later, no one.

160
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,260
 And then the voice comes on and you know there are call centers somewhere in the Philippines

161
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,940
 or India, right, when they speak to you anyway.

162
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,100
 No one enjoys waiting.

163
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:38,420
 I'm learning that waiting on God is actually very important in our relationship with Him.

164
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,100
 And it plays a key role in our spiritual development.

165
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:51,620
 Waiting does not have to create bitterness, anger, or loss of hope.

166
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:59,140
 It can establish a deeper trust and knowledge of who God is and His love for you.

167
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:09,780
 I pray, I pray that you would experience Him intimately as we wait on Him.

168
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,540
 But think about it for a moment.

169
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,380
 Jesus told His disciples to wait.

170
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,020
 He didn't say how long for, right?

171
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,460
 They did not know how long they would have to wait.

172
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:36,720
 Imagine me inviting you to a prayer meeting with no end time.

173
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,940
 This prayer meeting lasted 10 days.

174
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,500
 Could you imagine going to a 10-day prayer meeting and before you went, you didn't know

175
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,940
 when it was going to end?

176
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,780
 Now what was the reason they were able to endure this?

177
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:01,620
 In my opinion, it was togetherness.

178
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:09,180
 In Acts 2, verse 1, we read, "When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together

179
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,940
 in one place."

180
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
 Interesting that phrase.

181
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:21,900
 The Greek word for "in one place," omathumodon, is translated in some other versions of "with

182
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
 one accord."

183
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:32,460
 Actually, what it means is they were in the same place physically, like we are tonight,

184
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,260
 but they were in the same place spiritually.

185
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:46,740
 It means being unanimous, having mutual consent, being in agreement, having group unity, having

186
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,980
 one mind and purpose.

187
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,980
 Don't get me wrong.

188
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,340
 Unity is not uniformity.

189
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,980
 We don't have to look like each other, think like each other, or act like each other.

190
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,640
 But we can, I believe, and I believe this church can.

191
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:15,020
 We can be of one heart, one mind, and one purpose.

192
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,260
 Let's read on to see what happened as the result of being one.

193
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,220
 "When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.

194
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,780
 They were all of one accord.

195
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:38,640
 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came up from heaven and filled the whole

196
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,500
 house where they were sitting.

197
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,420
 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of

198
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
 them.

199
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:54,080
 All of them, all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other

200
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,560
 tongues as the Spirit enabled them."

201
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,040
 A little bit of background here.

202
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,940
 Jerusalem, it was the feast of Pentecost.

203
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,020
 It was filled with visitors.

204
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:14,840
 They were God-fearing Jews from all over the known world, gathering to give thanks for

205
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:23,420
 the first of the harvest and to celebrate the giving of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai.

206
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
 And isn't it amazing?

207
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,500
 It is here.

208
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:37,060
 Not in a secret stable, not on a lonely mountaintop, but in the middle of a city.

209
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,980
 It calls way bay, right?

210
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,780
 In the middle of a city bursting with people who had come to see Him.

211
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,340
 Isn't it amazing?

212
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,020
 That was where God showed up.

213
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:57,060
 God, the creator of the universe, who had existed from before the beginning of time,

214
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,760
 is physically present by His Holy Spirit.

215
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,900
 We read that wind from heaven fills the whole house.

216
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,300
 Wind just like Elijah felt in the cave.

217
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,720
 Fire, like Moses saw at the bush that didn't burn up.

218
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:24,500
 Like the fire that consumed Elijah's soaking sacrifice.

219
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:37,820
 And God speaks, not through a prophet or a priest, or in our case, a famous pastor, but

220
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:45,620
 through 120 uneducated, uncultured Galileans.

221
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,420
 So that everyone can hear and understand in their own language.

222
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,340
 I have a theory here.

223
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,880
 It's only my theory.

224
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,360
 This was not so much a gift of tongues, but a gift of ears.

225
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,460
 Because we read they were able to hear this in their own language.

226
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,560
 So it's quite likely that somebody was speaking something and two people or a number of people

227
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,800
 heard it in their own language.

228
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:20,360
 It is the story of the Tower of Babel in reverse.

229
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:27,880
 When the visitors eventually go home, they will return changed.

230
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,000
 Taking with them the experience of Pentecost.

231
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,960
 The Spirit living in them.

232
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,920
 The law written in their hearts.

233
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,200
 The first fruits of a new life in Christ.

234
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,160
 And then lastly, we see boldness.

235
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,120
 Now I want to tell you a joke now, but the only people in this room who are going to

236
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,760
 get this joke will be James and Paul.

237
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,320
 It's a cricket joke, right?

238
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,800
 You know what cricket is?

239
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,400
 Someone says to me, "Where does cricket occur in the Bible?"

240
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
 It's here.

241
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,000
 Peter went out with the 11 and was bold.

242
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 You won't understand that.

243
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,200
 I don't expect you to, but humor me for a moment.

244
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,880
 But what it meant was that Peter put his hand up.

245
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:26,640
 Peter, the denier, who had denied Jesus three times, became Peter the evangelist.

246
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,040
 That's why we have John chapter 21 and the story of Peter's restoration.

247
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,240
 Why Jesus asked Peter three times, "Do you love me?"

248
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,600
 And our team, we were there at that spot, weren't we, three years ago, where Jesus said

249
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,520
 to Peter, "Do you love me?"

250
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,960
 Now we've got to remember here that Jews from all over the known world are in Jerusalem

251
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,960
 for the Feast of Pentecost.

252
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:03,760
 So Peter takes his opportunity and he begins to preach.

253
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,680
 Throughout the sermon, Peter hammers away at a single point.

254
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:19,480
 Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour and people must put their faith in Him.

255
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:29,640
 This turning to Jesus in faith is summarized in a simple charge in verse 38, "Repent and

256
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,880
 be baptized."

257
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,300
 What are these Jews to repent of?

258
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:45,120
 It is their rejection of Jesus as Messiah and Saviour.

259
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:52,920
 And then we come to the result, verse 41, "So those who received His word were baptized

260
00:23:52,920 --> 00:24:00,800
 and there were added that day about 3,000 souls."

261
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,300
 I've got to come clean now.

262
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:15,100
 If I was Peter, if I was the disciples, what I would have done after 3,000 responses to

263
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:22,020
 my altar call, I would have started planning the next evangelistic meeting.

264
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,460
 Maybe we need a bigger venue.

265
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,740
 Oh, let's get our best worship band in, right?

266
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
 Who knows?

267
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,340
 Next time it might be 5,000 or 10,000.

268
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:42,100
 But my friends, the lesson is that church is not a one-and-a-half-hour service.

269
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:50,620
 Church is not even a gospel meeting or an evangelistic rally.

270
00:24:50,620 --> 00:25:01,580
 Over the next six weeks, we're going to be looking at how the early church responded

271
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,620
 to this influx of new believers.

272
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:18,420
 And in doing so, I believe that what we might be doing is redefining church.

273
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,820
 Redefining church.

274
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,020
 We're going to be looking at the four legs on my stool so we're not sitting there balanced

275
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,660
 on one.

276
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,900
 And we are going to be challenged.

277
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:40,780
 Next week, we're going to look at what happens when we gather around God's Word.

278
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,620
 Pastor James will be talking about what it is to have a Word-rooted church.

279
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,540
 We open chapter two with Pentecost, and then we heard Peter preach and 3,000 people repent

280
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,820
 and believe in Jesus.

281
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,340
 But those who stay behind in Jerusalem and don't return to their homes in the countryside,

282
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,180
 they form the first church.

283
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:10,660
 It's like they almost naturally come together to do what they are supposed to do to be a

284
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:18,660
 church and it starts around gathering around God's Word.

285
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:24,100
 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.

286
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:32,980
 Jerusalem was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.

287
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:43,100
 Pastor James, who I know deeply loves the Word of God, will introduce us to someone

288
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:51,460
 who unites us despite our different ethnicities, our different backgrounds, our different movie

289
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,860
 and food and exercise preferences.

290
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:05,740
 We will gather around Jesus and His Word.

291
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,780
 The week after that, we're going to look at that they shared meals and took communion

292
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:17,500
 together as Pastor Johnny looks at a hospitality-driven church.

293
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,500
 Food is a big deal for Pastor Johnny.

294
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,400
 And food was a big deal for the first church plant.

295
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,880
 They devoted themselves to the breaking of bread.

296
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,280
 They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts.

297
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,320
 The early church would eat together and celebrate the Lord's Supper as part of the meal.

298
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,100
 There was a continued time of fellowship focused around Christ and aided by food.

299
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,220
 And as you heard earlier, we have got the best deal ever for you to have food after.

300
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,900
 So what we're going to do after this sermon, Johnny, keep the sermon short, we're going

301
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,220
 to...after this sermon, we're going to go out and we're going to put this into practice

302
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
 downstairs.

303
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,860
 The third thing, we pray together.

304
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,940
 And on the 4th of June, Michelle is going to share with us about a prayer-centered church.

305
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,920
 It says here they devoted themselves to prayer and to praising God.

306
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,220
 In Acts, we found the early church praying together and worshiping God.

307
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,880
 Have you ever heard that they got church that prays together, stays together?

308
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,260
 We as a church have much to learn about prayer.

309
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:46,620
 And I know Pastor Michelle has a special burden for this topic and is someone who practices,

310
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,060
 really practices what she preaches.

311
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,780
 She will encourage us and challenge us at the same time.

312
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,900
 And we're going to come back to doing life together.

313
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,500
 And Pastor James is going to talk about what it is to be a community-based church.

314
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:10,700
 He will remind us that Christianity is not just a Bible study, but it's a lifestyle.

315
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,660
 They devoted themselves to fellowship.

316
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,500
 All the believers were together and had everything in common.

317
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,740
 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who needed.

318
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,860
 Every day, they continue to meet together in the temple courts.

319
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:32,820
 And this is the week that we will look at the church that is not a building, not a place,

320
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,340
 but a fellowship.

321
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,060
 People doing life together.

322
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,220
 James is someone who practices what he preaches.

323
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,780
 I'm so looking forward to hearing this sermon.

324
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,160
 So how do we do church together?

325
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,340
 We gather around God's Word.

326
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,960
 We share meals and take communion.

327
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,500
 We pray together and we do life together.

328
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,180
 So what's the fruit of all this?

329
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,780
 What is the outcome?

330
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,740
 Well the result is we grow.

331
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,380
 And on the 18th of June, I'm going to talk about what it is to be a kingdom-minded church.

332
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,720
 The last verse ends like this.

333
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:21,380
 The Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

334
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:28,660
 The result of this church family studying scriptures together, doing life together,

335
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,060
 sharing meals and communion together, and praying together is there's something so unique,

336
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:42,700
 distinct, and wonderful about them that others can't fail to come to faith in Christ.

337
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,860
 It's not they don't evangelize and witness.

338
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,660
 They do.

339
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,860
 But how they live positively affects their witness.

340
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,340
 My friends, this is what I want to see for this church.

341
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,860
 Mark the next six Saturdays in.

342
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
 Make sure you're here.

343
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,020
 And on the 25th of May, we're going to have a surprise for you.

344
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:15,200
 As we draw this all together, we're going to ask, what is church?

345
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,340
 As I ask the band to return, I'm going to make a declaration.

346
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,020
 It's not the way we normally finish the service.

347
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:29,420
 I'm going to make a declaration.

348
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:35,860
 On the 16th of March this year, at an event that was called The Tide is Turning, James

349
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:45,900
 and I were part of this, an event of Christians across Hong Kong, local, international, across

350
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:57,980
 denominations, I was invited to make a declaration on behalf of Hong Kong's 1,300 plus churches.

351
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:07,900
 Other people made declarations on behalf of business, education, government, next generation,

352
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,220
 etc.

353
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:16,020
 As we stood as one before our King.

354
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,620
 Tonight I'm going to make a similar declaration.

355
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,420
 I'm going to ask you to stand in a moment.

356
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:33,300
 I invite you to stand with me, say amen with me, and join us for the next six weeks as

357
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:39,100
 we investigate church together.

358
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,100
 Would you stand?

359
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,580
 If you feel comfortable closing your eyes, that's fine as well.

360
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,220
 There's going to be nothing on the screen.

361
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,660
 I want to read a verse from 2 Chronicles 7, 14.

362
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
 You know this one.

363
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,220
 "If my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face

364
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,700
 and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin

365
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,500
 and will heal their land."

366
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,140
 This is what I want to declare.

367
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:21,300
 "We are the church that you have established, that you gave life to by your Holy Spirit.

368
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:29,560
 But we have made the church to be things other than you intended.

369
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,740
 We have been guilty of building our own kingdoms and not yours.

370
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,100
 We have worshipped the gifting of men rather than the one who has bestowed their gifting

371
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,660
 upon them.

372
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:49,100
 We have exalted pastors, preachers, worship leaders, buildings.

373
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,400
 We have worshipped at the altars of big numbers, big donors.

374
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,060
 We have been divided.

375
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,220
 Church fighting church, denomination fighting denomination.

376
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,940
 We have placed our dogma ahead of relationships.

377
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:14,540
 We have wandered far away from the church you intended us to be.

378
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:22,820
 Father, we humble ourselves before you and choose today to repent of our sin, our pride,

379
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,820
 our worship of mammon.

380
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:34,880
 We are sorry when our religious zeal has placed the law of Moses above the grace of Jesus.

381
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,260
 We are sorry for inventing man-made rules to replace the work of your Spirit.

382
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:49,140
 We are sorry of making church a building, a place to go to rather than a thing we are.

383
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:55,780
 Our war is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities of this world.

384
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,600
 We bless you for our church communities.

385
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,540
 We bless you for our church leaders.

386
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,080
 And we bless you for our brothers and sisters in Christ.

387
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:11,280
 We recognize the love of Christ and the Spirit in God in so much of our church.

388
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,340
 Today we pray for healing, for those who have been hurt by our comments and our actions,

389
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,440
 for those we have rejected for doing things a different way or having a different style

390
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,160
 to ourselves.

391
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,560
 We pray for a new awakening, fresh wind and fresh fire.

392
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,960
 Renew your church from top to bottom.

393
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,600
 Remove the judgmental spirit from me.

394
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:44,560
 Free me from old habits and a spirit of religion and religiosity.

395
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,400
 Help me to be an ambassador of reconciliation.

396
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,040
 Give me a fresh love for your church and give me a servant heart.

397
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,120
 I declare that the Church of Hong Kong shall become your church, a pure and spotless bride

398
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,200
 awaiting the return of its bridegroom.

399
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,800
 I declare this is a new season, a new beginning, and the church will rise up to be the church

400
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,800
 you ordained on the day of Pentecost.

401
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,760
 I speak unity to the church.

402
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:23,360
 I take authority in Jesus' name to any spirit that would seek to cause division.

403
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:30,480
 I take an axe to the root of quarrelling, denominationalism and competition.

404
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:40,760
 I declare there is only one church in Hong Kong, the Church of Jesus Christ, and that

405
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,600
 you, Lord Jesus, are its head.

406
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,000
 I want to finish with some scripture.

407
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,720
 This is Jesus' last prayer before he went to the cross.

408
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,600
 My prayer is not for them alone.

409
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:03,480
 I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them

410
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,800
 may be one Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.

411
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,940
 May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.

412
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:21,400
 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one, I

413
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,320
 in them and you in me, so that we may be brought to complete unity.

414
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:39,320
 Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved

415
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,520
 me.

416
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
 Let's declare this in song.

417
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:53,800
