1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
 So I have the privilege of standing in for him on this Christmas Eve.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,800
 John, Sandra, we miss you.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
 We hope you're well.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,840
 We hope you're wrapped up nice and warm.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,840
 In England it's pretty cold here to be honest as well, right?

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,520
 Maybe even inside this church more than outside, but because of the air con.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,960
 Does anyone remember the name of the first candle that Pastor Johnny talked about?

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
 Hope.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,960
 Wow.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
 Wow.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 That's a really good, hope.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,920
 Well done, well done.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
 The hope of the world.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,320
 You hear this word quite a lot, right?

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,800
 And I feel as though we've been struggling with this word all these few years, at least

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
 since I've been in Hong Kong.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520
 We've just been like, "Oh, this has been such a hopeless situation.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,040
 Things have just been so hard.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,040
 It's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel."

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,040
 And then suddenly now things are starting to kind of ease up a little bit.

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,560
 Suddenly there seems to be a little hope.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,280
 So then I was thinking, "Well, wait, actually, why is that changing?

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
 Why am I feeling more...

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,280
 Who's feeling more hopeful now than they did maybe one year ago?"

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,920
 A few of us, right?

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
 And I feel it too.

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,920
 I mean, you see the light at the end of the tunnel.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,000
 Macau's opening up.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 That's pretty fun.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,760
 And then you're like, "Wait a minute.

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,880
 Why am I more hopeful today than I was last year?

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
 What is it...

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,080
 Wait, what is my hope actually based on?

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,880
 Is it based on the restrictions that are decided in the city?

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,900
 Is it my hope actually based on the economy?

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,120
 Is it based on how things are going in my life?"

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 That's sometimes how we base where our hope is, right?

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
 And the word we use...

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,740
 When we think about hope, I think we actually mis-sell what the word is actually really

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
 standing for.

41
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,080
 I say, "Look, I really hoped that England would win the World Cup."

42
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 Wow.

43
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
 That's a strong laugh, Charles.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
 That's a strong laugh.

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
 I really hoped that the weather would get a little bit warmer.

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
 I really hoped that the markets would go back up.

47
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
 I really hoped that the rents would keep going down.

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
 I really hoped that all these things...

49
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
 And I realized actually the way I use hope often is actually akin to how I say, "I wish."

50
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
 I wish England would win the World Cup.

51
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
 And yes, it was wishful thinking.

52
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
 But how do you use the word hope?

53
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
 When was the last time you said, "I hope"?

54
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
 "Oh, I just hope that I get to see this person.

55
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
 I just hope that I get to see this person."

56
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
 And I think that's a really good way to use it.

57
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
 I think that's a really good way to use it.

58
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
 I think that's a really good way to use it.

59
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
 I think that's a really good way to use it.

60
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:32,080
 I think that's a really good way to use it.

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,200
 What we're saying is, "I wish."

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,080
 I want.

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,680
 When we look at the word hope, especially in the Bible, it has a much, much stronger

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,640
 connotation.

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,920
 Jesus is not just the wish of the world.

66
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,600
 He is the hope of the world.

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,880
 So therefore, we need to understand what that word actually means, this word hope.

68
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,080
 We see in Hebrews 11 where it says, "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for."

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,840
 So what we're seeing is that the word hope is actually closer to the word faith than

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,760
 it is to the word wish.

71
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,980
 I may wish that the weather still is nice tomorrow, but hope is a different thing altogether.

72
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:17,200
 When I say I have hope in something, it represents something much more steadfast, much more assured.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,520
 That's what really hope is.

74
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,920
 And what we're going to do today is have a look a little bit about what that actually

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,920
 means, what the word hope means in the Bible, because it's not based on external circumstances.

76
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
 I can tell you that now.

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
 That is the final answer.

78
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,600
 It's not based on external circumstances.

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,840
 It's not based on the markets.

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
 It's not based on the weather.

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,680
 It's not based on which football team wins.

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,560
 It is based on something completely different.

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,220
 It's based on something that you cannot see.

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,320
 Because everything that we kind of try to become hopeful with is based on the things

85
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
 that we can see, right?

86
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,680
 Things that are happening in this world.

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,080
 But actually, the hope that is the biblical hope, the hope that transcends time, comes

88
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,600
 from things that we cannot see.

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,800
 And I'm going to do a short little message today.

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,720
 And the first passage we're going to look at is Romans chapter 8.

91
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,960
 So if you have your phones or your Bibles, I encourage you just to get them out.

92
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,920
 They're not going to be on the screen because it's just going to be a short little one.

93
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,540
 But Romans chapter 8, this majestic chapter in the Bible.

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,560
 Many scholars, many theologians love this chapter.

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,720
 It's their favourite one.

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,520
 It's packed with truth that can apply into every aspect of our lives.

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,400
 And Romans chapter 8, verse 24 says this, "For in this hope we were saved."

98
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
 For in this hope we were saved.

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,720
 And this kicks off three very short points regarding what actually hope is.

100
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,140
 One, the hope in this hope, this is the hope that saves.

101
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,280
 Number two, this is the hope that waits.

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,160
 And number three, this is the hope that lives.

103
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,000
 Saves, waits, lives.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,440
 I'm going to unpack briefly each one.

105
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,040
 Romans chapter 8, verse 24 says, "For in this hope we were saved.

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,680
 Now hope that is seen is not hope.

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,100
 For who hopes for what he sees?"

108
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,800
 So this hope that we're talking about is one that can actually save us.

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,520
 This isn't just wishful thinking just to have our lives to be more comfortable to the way

110
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,840
 that we want them to be.

111
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,680
 But this is the hope that actually saves us.

112
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,520
 The apostle Paul talks about this in Ephesians chapter 2.

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,840
 He says, "You had no hope.

114
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,560
 You were separated from Christ.

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
 You were alienated.

116
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
 You were strangers.

117
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
 You had no hope.

118
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,040
 And without God in the world, you were dead."

119
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,080
 But now you're alive because you've been saved.

120
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,960
 And Romans 8, if you just rewind and scan up a little bit or scroll up a little bit,

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,200
 you'll see that from verse 18, what he's talking about is he's saying, "Look, the sufferings

122
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,840
 that I'm going through at the present time are not worth comparing to the glory that

123
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 is revealed.

124
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,400
 Creation itself is longing, groaning, eagerly waiting for the revealing of the glory of

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
 God."

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,760
 What we're saying here, this is the hope that saves.

127
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,720
 What we're saying is that we are all waiting.

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,080
 We all have this hope that one day we will all be saved.

129
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,640
 One day creation itself will be redeemed.

130
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,000
 The whole of creation.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 You me.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,040
 Jesus says in Revelation 21, "When I come back, I'm going to make all things new.

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,440
 I'll wipe away every tear.

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,840
 There will be no more pain."

135
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,800
 That's the hope that we're looking for.

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,440
 And that is the hope that is saving us.

137
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,200
 And it starts with us recognizing this Christmas that actually we need saving.

138
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,960
 The whole point of Christmas is that we need saving.

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,680
 That's why Jesus had to come.

140
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,880
 So it's the hope that saves.

141
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,520
 It is the hope that saves.

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
 We hear this term quite a lot.

143
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
 It's the hope that kills you.

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
 Right?

145
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 You hear that.

146
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,280
 There's people telling you, "Stop hoping for things."

147
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,620
 But what they're saying is actually it's the wish that kills you.

148
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,720
 When you keep wishing for these things, it's not going to happen because life is all about

149
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 disappointment.

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,680
 Life is all about handling those disappointments.

151
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,860
 So that's when they say it's the hope that kills you.

152
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:56,080
 But if you have a hope in something that is actually way more than what this world has,

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,160
 then it's a hope that saves.

154
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,460
 It's a hope that is assured.

155
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,200
 It's the faith that you need.

156
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,800
 So number one, it is a hope that saves you.

157
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,160
 Number two, it is a hope that waits.

158
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,260
 If you carry on, chapter 8, verse 25 says this, "But if we hope for what we do not see,

159
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,900
 we wait for it with patience."

160
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,200
 We wait for it with patience.

161
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
 This is the hope that waits.

162
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 I'm an impatient person.

163
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,700
 I was just confessing the other week to a group of people that I do life with, and I

164
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,020
 was saying, "What's your worst fruit of the Spirit?

165
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,460
 If you look at all the fruits of the Spirit, which is the one that you really suck at?"

166
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,200
 And I said patience was my one.

167
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,460
 That's the one that really gets me.

168
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,540
 And if you look at 1 Corinthians 13 and the list of what love is, love is patient and

169
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,220
 I can't remember the rest because I can't get past the first one.

170
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,780
 I'm terrible with patience because I want things now.

171
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
 I want things yesterday.

172
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,220
 And we're in a culture that really does feed that.

173
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,860
 We had to renew my son's passport recently.

174
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,860
 I had to send it back to the UK, and they said, "It will be done very soon.

175
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,700
 It will be done in 10 weeks."

176
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,380
 I'm like, "This must be going by ship.

177
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,820
 They must be literally paddling towards the UK."

178
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,140
 I'm just like, "I want it now."

179
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
 Why?

180
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
 I don't know.

181
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
 I just want it now.

182
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,660
 I want to be able to watch it right now.

183
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
 I want to be able to do it right now.

184
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,380
 I want to be able to eat it right now.

185
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,820
 And in Hong Kong, that's the worst.

186
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,380
 And that feeds all my impatience.

187
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:22,060
 But true hope, true hope is one that is willing to wait.

188
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,300
 Because you know that it's coming, but it's not yet.

189
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,260
 But because you know it's coming, then you're filled with this kind of faith.

190
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,900
 You see, the reason why we're impatient is actually because we lack trust.

191
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
 The reason why we're impatient is because, you know, we're like, "God, actually, we don't

192
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,380
 believe that you know your timing.

193
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,940
 God, we think that you actually might be late."

194
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,940
 Can you see?

195
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,060
 When we're impatient for God, when we say, "God, when is that life goal going to be achieved?

196
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,140
 When is this going to happen?

197
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,140
 When is that going to happen?

198
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
 When is that?"

199
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,140
 What are we saying?

200
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,940
 We're saying, "Actually, God, I don't trust you."

201
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,420
 So patience is actually a key element to trusting in God, in faith, in hope.

202
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,420
 It is a hope that waits.

203
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,060
 So we instead are not filled with patience, not filled with hope and faith.

204
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,300
 We're filled with impatience and anxiety.

205
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
 And I've told this before.

206
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,860
 I'm the kind of person that likes to read the Wikipedia plot of a movie before I actually

207
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,420
 watch the movie, because I find myself getting so anxious when I'm watching these films and

208
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,220
 these TV shows, watching these characters go downhill, and watching these people break

209
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
 up, watching these people die.

210
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,020
 And I'm just like, "Oh, I just need to know the end already."

211
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,020
 I'm that person.

212
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,580
 Or maybe last week when I was watching the World Cup final, right?

213
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,380
 I mean, what a crazy game.

214
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,300
 For the first 79 minutes, it was all calm, and one team was dominating, and they were

215
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,060
 ready to go home.

216
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,220
 And then suddenly, the 80th minute, within 90 seconds, it's 2-2.

217
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,460
 And then you have 30-something minutes, 40 minutes of craziness and penalty shootouts.

218
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,460
 Everyone who watches penalty shootouts, whether you know the teams or not, you're like, "Oh

219
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,260
 my goodness, what's going to happen?"

220
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,540
 Don't we have that?

221
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,340
 Imagine if you went to watch that game now.

222
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,380
 Would you be filled with the same anxiety?

223
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
 No.

224
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,620
 You'd be like, "Oh, 78th minute, but something's going to happen.

225
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,740
 But it's going to be okay.

226
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
 Penalty shootout.

227
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
 Oh, it's okay.

228
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,900
 I know who wins."

229
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,420
 That's the same kind of hope we have, because as we look at this book here, we know the

230
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,060
 beginning and the end.

231
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,260
 And then we should be filled with that same calmness.

232
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,620
 It's like, "Things aren't going well right now.

233
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,020
 I know they're not going well.

234
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,540
 This Bible tells me that there will be many problems.

235
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,660
 If I flick to John 16, 33, it says, 'In this world you will have trouble.'

236
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,860
 But take heart, I have overcome the world, and I will come again."

237
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,300
 The power of Christmas isn't that Jesus came.

238
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,380
 It's that Jesus is going to come again, because this person that came 2,020 years ago is going

239
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
 to come again.

240
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,460
 And that's the end of the story.

241
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,820
 And because we know the end of the story, we're filled with calmness.

242
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,500
 We're filled with patience.

243
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,540
 We can wait.

244
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,900
 We can wait for something that we cannot see.

245
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,460
 We can wait for it with patience, because we know it's coming, because we know it's

246
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
 the end.

247
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
 Why?

248
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,740
 Because there was once a man that came to earth and said that he would die, and then

249
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,620
 he would rise again.

250
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,540
 And then it actually happened.

251
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,780
 And this man, Jesus, says he's going to come again.

252
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,440
 So we have hope.

253
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
 And so we can wait.

254
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,660
 And so we can be filled with peace and have no anxiety, because we can wait.

255
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,460
 And we can also tolerate.

256
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,460
 As we go through this story, as we go through extra time, as we go through penalties and

257
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,660
 the highs and lows of life, we can tolerate a lot because we see the end goal.

258
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,100
 We know that we will win at the very end.

259
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,660
 Right?

260
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,180
 So if you are an Argentina fan watching that game, you're like, "I'm cool.

261
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
 I'm relaxed.

262
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
 Oh my goodness, it's 2-2.

263
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,180
 They're scoring again.

264
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
 We could lose."

265
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,180
 No, we can't.

266
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,180
 Oh, I remember, because I've watched it.

267
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,640
 I know the ending of this.

268
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,380
 This is exactly what is going to happen.

269
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,380
 And you can tolerate a lot of the highs and lows because you know what's at the right

270
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
 at the very end.

271
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,420
 And there's this passage in 1 Thessalonians 4.13 that says, "We don't even grieve as those

272
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,980
 who have no hope."

273
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,820
 So what it says is, you can tolerate all these highs and lows, even the very lows, even the

274
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,020
 lows of losing a loved one.

275
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,100
 You can still grieve, but you won't grieve in the same way.

276
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
 Why?

277
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,900
 Because you have hope.

278
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,260
 Am I convincing you that this kind of hope is very different to the kind of hope that

279
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,580
 we talk about?

280
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:42,260
 This hope means that you can stare at death face to face, and you can grieve loss, but

281
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,700
 you still have an unshakable hope because you know that this is not the end.

282
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,780
 Everything is not right right now.

283
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,780
 Everything will be all right in the end.

284
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,940
 And if it's not all right now, then it's not the end yet.

285
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,740
 That is a hope that we have.

286
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,020
 One, a hope that saves.

287
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,700
 Two, a hope that waits.

288
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,580
 And finally, why do we have this?

289
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,420
 Because we have a hope that lives.

290
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,540
 As I said, Christmas is not because 2022 years ago a baby was born.

291
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,540
 That's not why we celebrate Christmas.

292
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,980
 That's not why we have these whole huge celebrations across the city and all these crazy displays

293
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,100
 in shopping malls.

294
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,460
 We celebrate Christmas and have all these things, not because a baby was born 2022 years

295
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:28,500
 ago, it's because that baby is still, that baby, now God, Jesus, is still alive now.

296
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,140
 Because this hope is one that lives.

297
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,820
 One Peter 1.3 says this, "Cause the living hope."

298
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,940
 Why?

299
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,460
 Because Jesus was born, he died, and then he resurrected again, and he remains with

300
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,840
 us today.

301
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,700
 We have a hope that lives.

302
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
 That's a big deal.

303
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,220
 And we sing about this all the time.

304
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,540
 We hear about it in church all the time, but never let ourselves take that for granted,

305
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,100
 that we actually have a hope that lives.

306
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,020
 He is truly the living hope.

307
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,100
 And that is the power of Christmas.

308
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,620
 That we don't worship this cute little baby that once existed 2000 years ago.

309
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,820
 No, we worship this because this baby turned into a man, a sinless man, and died for the

310
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,260
 sins of many, and then rose again.

311
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,300
 That's why we worship Christmas.

312
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,980
 That's why we celebrate Christmas, because we have a hope that lives.

313
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,100
 More importantly, we have a hope that lives in you.

314
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,300
 That same power that defeated the grave now lives in you.

315
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,620
 Through his spirit, Jesus Christ lives in you.

316
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,700
 And I'll give you one more passage today.

317
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,500
 In Colossians 1.27, Paul says this, "There is a mystery."

318
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 And what's the mystery?

319
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,540
 "That Christ is in you, the hope of glory."

320
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,580
 Have we heard that before?

321
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,620
 Christ in you, the hope of glory.

322
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,580
 And I've always wondered, what does that actually mean?

323
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,820
 If we just briefly go back to Romans 8, you'll see that actually those who belong to Christ

324
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,300
 have his spirit within us.

325
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,780
 You right now have his spirit within you.

326
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,380
 Galatians 2 says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."

327
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,660
 Do you believe that?

328
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,500
 If you're a follower of Christ, if you believe in Christ, then basically you have his spirit

329
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,380
 within you.

330
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,020
 And that spirit, he is living.

331
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,580
 He is your living hope.

332
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,260
 Christ in you, the hope of glory.

333
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
 What does that mean?

334
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,140
 It means Christ is within you and he brings with him the hope of all the glorious things

335
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,380
 to come.

336
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
 Everything that is to come.

337
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,740
 And that's why scripture says, "Don't lose heart, for your outer selves are wasting away,

338
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,900
 but your inner selves are being renewed day by day."

339
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:50,220
 What you're going through right now are light and momentary afflictions compared to this

340
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,740
 eternal weight of glory that awaits you.

341
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,420
 All the trouble that you've had here, all the hopelessness that you've had here, is

342
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,860
 nothing compared to the glory that is coming.

343
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,220
 It is a hope that saves.

344
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,020
 It is a hope that we wait for.

345
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,300
 And it is a hope that lives.

346
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,100
 So let's use the word hope in the way that it's supposed to be used.

347
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,780
 Have you heard of another one, "We hope for the best"?

348
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,580
 That is the weakest kind of thing, right?

349
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
 You know, I'm just gonna...

350
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,580
 Students, I'm just not gonna study and I'm just gonna do the exam and I'm just gonna

351
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,140
 hope for the best.

352
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,580
 It's a very helpless one, isn't it?

353
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,340
 But if you're a believer, you can actually turn that one to have something that's much

354
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,140
 more significant, much more impactful, and much more meaningful.

355
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,420
 When you say, "I hope for the best," what you're saying is, "I have faith in what is

356
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,940
 to come will be better than anything here.

357
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,900
 I hope for the best."

358
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,900
 Another sentence, another quote, "Because the best is yet to come."

359
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,980
 We always see that, right?

360
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,420
 Sometimes people use that as their email signatures, "The best is yet to come."

361
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,800
 Because we truly believe the best is yet to come.

362
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,180
 So we as believers, we have this hope.

363
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,540
 It's because we hope for the best, because we know Jesus is coming again.

364
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,200
 That is why the best is yet to come.

365
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,260
 That is why we have this hope.

366
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,820
 That's what this Christmas is about.

367
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,700
 That's what Advent, coming towards Christmas, is about.

368
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,380
 Advent, the coming of Jesus.

369
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,180
 Advent starts in the dark and ends in the light.

370
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,100
 As he lit each one of those candles, it started dark and it ends light because we believe

371
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:32,380
 that Christ, the light of the world, the hope of the world, entered into the hopelessness,

372
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,160
 entered into the darkness.

373
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,900
 So we can have faith.

374
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
 We can have hope.

375
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,060
 And we can wait, because we know the end is going to be good.

376
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,780
 Brothers and sisters, may this Christmas season, may you be filled with a hope that is unshakable.

377
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,360
 May it be much more than just wishful thinking.

378
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:02,540
 May it be rooted and grounded in what Jesus did for you and what he says he will do again.

379
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,740
 Let's pray.

380
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,220
 Jesus we thank you.

381
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:17,140
 Thank you that you are the hope of the world and not a weak, wishful, helpless kind of

382
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:25,700
 hope, but one that is far beyond anything that we can ever wish for.

383
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,700
 We pray, Lord, that you would instill in us, instill in our hearts a renewed sense of this

384
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,340
 hope that isn't based on external circumstances, whether borders open up or not, whether COVID

385
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,220
 goes or not, whether markets go up or down or not, whether wars stop or not.

386
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,180
 We have a hope, not in anything in this world.

387
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:55,100
 We have a hope, a faith in what is to come.

388
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,300
 And may that hope impact every part of our lives.

389
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:08,780
 May that hope lift our spirits, lift our eyes, give us the strength to navigate all the challenges,

390
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:20,500
 to tolerate all the losses, the grief, the sadness, the heartbreak.

391
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:27,700
 Because of this hope, we can hang on, because we know you are coming for us.

392
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,940
 Thank you, Lord, for this Christmas, that you remind us that we get to celebrate your

393
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,820
 coming and we also get to look forward to, we get to hope for, we get to have faith in

394
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,340
 your coming again.

395
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,100
 Because of that, we are filled with joy, regardless of anything that we see.

396
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,820
 In your name we pray.

397
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,400
 (gentle music)
