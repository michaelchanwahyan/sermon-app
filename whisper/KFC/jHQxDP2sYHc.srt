1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
 Good evening. How's everybody doing? Great. We're finishing up our series on Jesus,

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,680
 a heart that values. And who's enjoyed the series on the different stories of

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,000
 Jesus? Who's enjoyed them? Yeah? That's great. That's good. I'm once again

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,520
 teaching on the healing of a blind person. Now, I don't know why. Maybe John

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:39,120
 assigned me to really focus on the blind. But this is the second topic on a

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,040
 healing of the blind person. And as you might remember from the last sermon, the

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:54,040
 first blind person was healed with what process? You remember? It was spit,

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,800
 yes? And it was a two-step process. Right? Two-step process. He spit in his eyes and

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,280
 then it's like, "What do you see?" I see, you know, the the trees of green and red

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:14,000
 roses too. Right? And then he had to do it a second time. "Now what do you see?" Okay.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,680
 Now I see clearly. This second one is a little bit different. Because the first

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,840
 person that we said, that we read about, the first blind person that we read

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,880
 about, we knew that he's seen before because of that. Right? What do you see?

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,160
 Well, I think I see people. I see trees or whatever that blind person said. But this

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,280
 man that we looked at, that Bonnie read for us beautifully, he was a man born

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:52,560
 blind. A man born blind. And the disciples right away, what do they say? "Rabbi, who

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:04,000
 sinned? The man or his parents?" Right away, the disciples play the blame game. Right?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,040
 And our world is full of the blame game. Right? Countries like to blame other

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,520
 countries. Right? Trump loves to blame everybody. Right? Yeah, it's never my

20
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,480
 fault. Right? It's always that country or that person's fault. Trump never, you know,

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,040
 takes responsibility. Right? Paul likes to take responsibility, on the other hand.

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,840
 Right? For his marriage, for all the keys that go wrong, the guitar strings that...

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,400
 No, no, okay. Even in sports, right? You look at the interviews at the end. It's

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,720
 either, well, you know, Kobe's always like, it's on me. It's on my shoulders. I should

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 have taken, you know, that fourth-quarter shot. I should have taken it to the rack.

26
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,920
 I should have won. Right? Whereas you have the other person, who's somebody

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,120
 who likes to blame somebody in sports. Never his fault. Maybe it's Embiid, right?

28
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,240
 He's like crying. It's Hardin's fault that we didn't advance. It's Kawhi Leonard's

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,520
 fault. It's the rim's fault because it bounced like ten times before it went in.

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,860
 Do you guys remember that miraculous shot with the blue tongue because he was

31
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:33,540
 drinking blue Gatorade? Blame versus responsibility. Look at the person beside

32
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:41,140
 you. Do they take blame or responsibility, you think? Huh?

33
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:49,820
 Somebody... It farted. Oh, who farted? It wasn't me. Somebody else's, right? Don't

34
00:03:49,820 --> 00:04:00,340
 look at each other. You have plenty of time for that, Florence and Julian. So,

35
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:07,900
 healing of the blind, right? Mark 8, we saw the two-step process, and today we're

36
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:16,180
 gonna see the person that was born blind also be healed. Now, blindness back then, it

37
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,220
 wasn't uncommon, okay? It wasn't uncommon because it was very unsanitary. It

38
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:30,160
 wasn't as clean as it was now, if you jump to the blindness slide. Yeah, and what it

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,100
 meant for a blind person was that there was usually no careers, right? Have you

40
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:45,180
 have you guys been to Thailand, to Bangkok? In the airport, I saw a massage.

41
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,700
 Do you know who was doing the massage? Have you guys seen it? I think

42
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,620
 you... Yeah, you've seen it, right? In Thailand, I saw... Whoa, these blind people are

43
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,780
 giving people massages. That's really cool, right? There's a job for these

44
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:10,740
 people. But back then, in biblical times, in Jesus' time, it meant you had no job, and

45
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:18,860
 you relied on the goodness of people. And this beggar, in particularly, was at the

46
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:28,100
 temple, right? It was at the temple. And so, they were debating, they were debating

47
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:41,460
 whose fault was it that this man was born blind? Was it the parents, or was it

48
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,180
 the person born blind? Who thinks it was the parents? Who's to blame? Who... Anybody

49
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,180
 want to... If you had to choose one or the other, who would you choose? The parents,

50
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:03,820
 or the baby born blind? Who do you think would be more, legally speaking,

51
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:10,180
 responsible? Uncle Vincent, from a legal perspective, any...

52
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:21,260
 Any ideas? From a prosecutor's perspective, anything different? No? No.

53
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,580
 But these are the kind of discussions they like to have back then, okay?

54
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:34,980
 Now, in Jewish law, they had this law of retribution. The law of retribution.

55
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:41,180
 Anybody heard of it? The law of retribution? It states this, that the religious...

56
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:47,180
 Sorry, righteous, were blessed according to their righteousness. So, if you did

57
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,580
 well, if you were good, then you would be blessed. Makes sense, right? Sort of like a

58
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,140
 lot of the golden rules. Karma, you do good, and you know, and then good will be

59
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,700
 done unto you. Now, the wicked would be cursed according to their wickedness. If

60
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,620
 you do bad, then bad things would happen to you. So, this was, according to sort of

61
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,700
 their Jewish custom at the time, the way that they would explain the tragedies of

62
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:27,580
 life. That all life's difficulties were a judgment of sin. So, if something bad

63
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:34,140
 happened to you, right? Maybe you were born with a particular height,

64
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,380
 just for example, because we've been on this topic for a while. Somebody's to

65
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,660
 blame, alright? Somebody... I don't know who's to blame. Maybe it's your parents.

66
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,220
 Maybe it's you. Maybe you've done something bad in your past life. There...

67
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:03,900
 There was... Well, for a man being born blind,

68
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:11,580
 the parents could have been to blame. There were congenital blindness as

69
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,820
 result of sexually transmitted diseases back then. Because of unsanitary

70
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:28,260
 conditions, because of STDs, it could have been the parents. It made sense. The result

71
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,980
 of sin could have been blindness for the child. But if the blind man was to blame,

72
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:43,540
 how could he have been blamed for this? How could a blind man been

73
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:50,780
 born? What sin could he have done? I mean, he hasn't been born yet. And this was

74
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,300
 what the disciples were discussing here. So, there's three sort of

75
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:04,500
 key views that we see here. The first is the predestinarian view. Predestinarian

76
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,900
 view states this, that one is judged in advance for the sinful choices they

77
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,620
 would make later in life. So somehow, God knew that you were gonna do something

78
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:29,300
 bad in your future. And so he judged you, he prejudged you, and gave you this

79
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:37,700
 blindness. That's one of their first thoughts. Predestinarian view. Now,

80
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,300
 the second one is the prenatal view. Anybody... Any guesses on what it could

81
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:53,900
 mean? Prenatal view. Now, it actually could mean that the man actually sinned in the

82
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:04,900
 womb. Anybody remember their sins in their womb? You remember? Somebody nodded. I

83
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:11,700
 don't know if he was nodding off or... He actually remembered. This was the other,

84
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,900
 second view. Prenatal view. That you actually can sin within the womb. And

85
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,980
 because of that, God judges you. And particularly, this man was made blind.

86
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:34,780
 Born blind. The last view is this, the past life view. So, it's basically pre...

87
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:42,820
 Pre, past, and present, right? So this is the past life view. What do you think it

88
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:51,540
 means, past life view? Any ideas? Any guesses? No guesses. Actually, back then,

89
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:58,780
 some rabbis believed in a form of reincarnation. Some commentary says this,

90
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:06,420
 that sins in this life attributed to the sins committed in the past. So, some small

91
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,780
 sect of rabbis believed that there was some sort of reincarnation. That in your

92
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:20,140
 past, you committed something wrong, and because of that, you are now

93
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:27,500
 paying the price in this new life. So,

94
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:36,580
 any votes? Who thinks any of these views are the... is the right view? Or the one you

95
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:43,220
 agree with most? Let's just take a vote, just for fun, just to get everybody up.

96
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:50,460
 Predestinarian view. Who thinks this was the most... this view makes the most sense

97
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:57,460
 for them? Predestinarian view. That this man is judged for the sins that he

98
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:05,580
 would make in the future. Anybody? Yeah? Kelly? Okay. Kelly, why did you...

99
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:14,180
 Come on! I just want to have some fun, right? It's our last night. Last Saturday

100
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:21,020
 night. Or JP, come on. Give us any ideas. Just say something. God is omniscient.

101
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:28,140
 Okay, God is omniscient. Okay, very good. Okay, second view. Prenatal view. That you

102
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,500
 could actually sin in the... let's ask the person who actually nodded off.

103
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:41,300
 Alright, why did you think or nod? I think because the pain that caused you to sin,

104
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,060
 right? And sometimes when you're in pain, you kind of lose that logic or

105
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,140
 control in order to make you sin more. You felt pain in the womb? Is that your

106
00:12:52,140 --> 00:13:00,620
 thing? Interesting. Okay, he felt pain in the womb. I'm not gonna argue against it.

107
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,140
 Past life view. I guess everybody's a past life view. You all believe in

108
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:11,780
 reincarnation? Okay, you don't have to raise your hand. It's okay. Alright, so

109
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,860
 there's three different views, but what does Jesus say in response to the

110
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,940
 disciples asking this question? Let's read it together. Verse 2 here. 1, 2, 3.

111
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:31,940
 Or verse 3, sorry. 1, 2, 3. "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," Jesus said. "But

112
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,140
 this happened that the works of God might be displayed in him. As long as it

113
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:42,900
 is day, we must do the works of the one who sent me. Night is coming when no one

114
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:54,380
 can work." Wow. Okay, so what is Jesus' view? So Jesus' view is that this man didn't sin.

115
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:06,300
 The parents didn't sin either. So who is to blame? Is Jesus blaming God? Is

116
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:13,260
 that the view here? Jesus is saying, "No, this happened. There's no one

117
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:21,180
 to blame." Blame is not the right word. Would you agree? Blame is not the right

118
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:28,140
 word. Blame is suggesting that someone did something wrong.

119
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,380
 Blame is not the right word. Instead, Jesus is saying someone took

120
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:40,700
 responsibility. Is that right? No, that's not right also because it means

121
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,660
 somebody also did something wrong, right? So blame isn't the right

122
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:52,140
 word. Responsibility isn't the right word. What is the right word? Uncle Vincent,

123
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,020
 what do you think is the right word? I'm really getting your involvement. Come on,

124
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:04,580
 let's get it together, guys. Blame isn't the right word. Taking

125
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:11,820
 responsibility isn't the right word. God had a plan, the best plan. That's the

126
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:20,860
 right word. You're welcome, Uncle Vincent. I got you. And what is the biblical

127
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,340
 view? What is the Old Testament view? What is the New Testament view? The Old

128
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,380
 Testament view is that we live in a broken world because of Adam and Eve, and

129
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,500
 because of that, this world is due to sin. And so we're not in our perfect bodies.

130
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:43,660
 We're in our corrupted, sinful bodies because of the first sin, original sin,

131
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:52,060
 right? But God has a plan. God has a plan. He uses the broken things of this world,

132
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:59,660
 the sinful, the weak things of this world, to reveal his nature, to reveal his grace

133
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:10,780
 and his love. He uses our brokenness and makes it a blessing. Amen? Amen.

134
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:22,420
 So that is the view. So what happens after this? Jesus heals this man. He goes...

135
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:29,620
 Jesus loves using mud for the eyes. Did you guys try it in Israel? Put some mud

136
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,740
 in your eyes. Maybe you saw further. Didn't need laser surgery. Maybe you had

137
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,340
 correctional. I'll try it when I go to Israel. Maybe I'll put it on my eyes.

138
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,420
 Maybe I can see further. From 20/20 to 30/30 maybe? Yeah? See further. I'm just

139
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:56,340
 playing with you guys. It's a fun night. Come on. Okay, let's read together verse

140
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:03,660
 13 to 17. All right? Let's see what happens afterwards. So somehow this

141
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,180
 man miraculously gets healed. Let's read together what happens afterwards. One, two,

142
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,460
 three.

143
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:23,060
 All right. So a miracle happened. A man that was born blind, now they confirm

144
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:30,720
 sort of, "Yeah, it must be this man. He's been healed." And what is the religious

145
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,820
 leaders, what is their response? Are they like, "Wow, praise the Lord.

146
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:45,500
 Hallelujah. Let's sing a thousand hallelujahs." Right? Is that the response?

147
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:52,540
 No. So it's very interesting. There's four perspectives here. Firstly, the disciples,

148
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,500
 their perspective is they saw the blind man. And what was their response? They're

149
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:05,420
 like, "This man should be used for our intellectual debate. Who is to blame?" They

150
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,340
 didn't see the need of this blind man. They didn't care for him, feed him, help

151
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,060
 him, ask Jesus to heal him. No. They just wanted to go into an intellectual debate.

152
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:23,740
 The religious leaders, what is the response?

153
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,820
 What do religious leaders care for? Their

154
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:37,660
 religion, keeping their standards, setting the bar high. They wanted to protect the

155
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:45,420
 law and the Sabbath. Why were the Pharisees so unhappy? Why were they so

156
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:54,740
 unhappy? Because are you allowed to make mud on Sabbath? You're not allowed to

157
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,180
 make mud on the Sabbath. It was the Sabbath. When did Jesus heal this guy?

158
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:06,300
 What does it say? It was on Sabbath. It's a sacred day. You're supposed to rest.

159
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:13,520
 You're not allowed to make mud. And so the Pharisees ignored Christ's power to

160
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:23,460
 heal because they saw that the keeping of Christ's law and Sabbath

161
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:32,460
 were more important than his healing. They felt that Christ was intruding

162
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:43,500
 their theological rules and perspectives. Verse 14, right? Let's read verse 14 again.

163
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:50,160
 "Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was on the

164
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,480
 Sabbath." You're not allowed to make mud and you're not certainly not allowed to

165
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,940
 heal on the Sabbath. God is resting, right? He has the other six days to do

166
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:08,960
 miracles. Jesus, you can't be healing. Come on. And so the Pharisees are so upset

167
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,480
 that the Sabbath has been broken, this man has been healed, that what do they

168
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,440
 call in? Who do they call in? The man's parents, right? So let's read this

169
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,120
 together. Verse 16 to 24. Okay, let's read that. Can you read this for me?

170
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,800
 One, two, three.

171
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:40,520
 [inaudible]

172
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,800
 They still did not believe.

173
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:52,640
 [inaudible]

174
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,320
 So the Pharisees asked the parents to come in to have confirmation because in

175
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,400
 Jewish law, customs, you need at least two or three people as witnesses. So the

176
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,880
 parents come in. Is this your son? Has he been born? Was he born blind? Has he been

177
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:21,520
 healed? If you were the parents and your son had just been healed and can see, how

178
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:29,200
 would you react? How would you react, guys? Give thanks. You would sing give

179
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:39,320
 thanks, right? You would be ecstatic. You would be so happy. You'd be in tears

180
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,080
 telling everybody. But what is the parents' reaction here? How would you

181
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,280
 describe it? How would you describe the parents'

182
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,040
 reaction here? Parents, how would you describe it?

183
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:10,280
 Ni hao. Michelle? Huh? Mild. Are they eating something mild? Some noodles,

184
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:21,000
 mild noodles? Yeah, mild. They're fearful, right? He is our son, but now he can

185
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,880
 see now and who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age. He will speak

186
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,520
 for himself. They're afraid. What are they afraid of? They're afraid of the

187
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,640
 religious leaders. What else are they afraid of? They're afraid they're gonna

188
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:45,200
 get kicked out of this community, the synagogue, because having community was a

189
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,160
 very important identity back then, right? Like having your football club

190
00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:01,640
 membership, country club membership. What membership do you guys have? Right? So

191
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,920
 important. KFCI membership, right? Right? They didn't want to lose their

192
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,400
 membership. They worked their whole life for this. They memorized the Old

193
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,320
 Testament when they were young. They did the--what's the celebration when

194
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,040
 they became teens? What's it called again? Bar Mitzvah, right? They're a part of

195
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,880
 this whole community. They've been working their whole life for it, and now

196
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:37,240
 it's being threatened. It's being threatened. The parents were threatened

197
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,320
 that they would--frightened that they would be excommunicated, rejected because

198
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:50,280
 their son was also gonna be rejected. There was a social pressure from the

199
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,760
 religious leaders, and it was so great. They couldn't celebrate their own

200
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:04,760
 child being healed. Your own child could see again. They couldn't celebrate.

201
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:16,640
 That's crazy. That is crazy. And so, just to recap, the disciples, they saw the blind

202
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,120
 man, and what did they see? They saw an intellectual debate. They were like,

203
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,560
 "Who's to blame? Let's have a fun debate here." They didn't see the man's needs. The

204
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,920
 Pharisees, they saw the blind man being healed, and what did they see? They saw

205
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,960
 rules being broken. Who broke the rule? It's the Sabbath. No healing. No mud making.

206
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,120
 Don't make mud on Sundays, guys, or Saturdays for Jews. Don't make mud.

207
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:57,440
 The parents, they saw their son, and instead of seeing a miracle, instead of

208
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:06,240
 seeing Jesus work the miracle, they saw fear. Fear. Incredible.

209
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:14,600
 But there's one last perspective, and that perspective is obviously Jesus.

210
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 Jesus saw the blind man. What value does the blind man have in that society?

211
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:33,320
 Not much value, but Jesus saw value in him. Jesus saw his weakness, and he turned

212
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:44,160
 it into a blessing, that the work of God might be seen in and through him.

213
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,800
 So,

214
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:58,120
 it says this in verse 35. Let's read this together, verse 35. So, they threw him out,

215
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:08,920
 right? One, two, three. Jesus heard. Why did they kick him out? Do you know why

216
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,640
 they kicked him out? Cuz

217
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:23,840
 earlier, just before this, sorry I don't have it, but the blind man was saying, "No

218
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:31,800
 mere man can heal." Right? "No mere man can heal." Is this it? No, no. "No mere man

219
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:39,160
 can heal." And the blind man was like, "But this man healed me, so he must be from God.

220
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,720
 He must be a prophet." And the religious leaders, they were so fed up that they

221
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:55,640
 threw him out. They threw him out. No mere man can heal. Jesus was able to heal.

222
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:04,920
 Jesus is no mere man. He must be from God. And what does Jesus do at the end here?

223
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,440
 "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" That's one of his names in the Old Testament.

224
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:17,800
 "The Son of Man will come down on clouds of fire." On clouds, sorry. He reveals his

225
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:27,360
 identity. Who is he? And Jesus says, "The one speaking to you." He reveals himself.

226
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,400
 This is one of the very few times Jesus reveals himself to the Samaritan woman,

227
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:42,080
 the Messiah. "I am he." And he says it to the blind man here. "I am that person, the

228
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:50,080
 one speaking to you." And what is the man's reaction? He says, "Lord, I believe." And

229
00:27:50,080 --> 00:28:01,520
 what did he do? He worshipped, praised, gave Jesus all the glory. The glory that

230
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,640
 he belongs, that only he, that belongs to him. Thank you. Still a little sick. That

231
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:21,520
 is okay. Because Jesus makes us strong in our weakness. And so Jesus saw this blind

232
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:30,920
 man in the temple on the floor begging. Nobody looked at him. Nobody cared. Nobody

233
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:39,200
 valued him. Nobody gave him a job. He had no value. But Jesus saw him.

234
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:49,160
 Touched his eyes, put mud in his eyes, and healed him. The disciples didn't see him

235
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,920
 as somebody that needed to be loved, that was precious, that was valued.

236
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:02,520
 Just intellectual debate. The Pharisees saw him as a religious, somebody broke

237
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:10,080
 the religious laws and kicked him out. And the parents were so fearful that they

238
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:21,600
 didn't see a miracle through Jesus. And so today, as we enter into our new season,

239
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,960
 as we enter into our new season, I just want us to give thanks for the last

240
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:39,760
 seven years. The last seven years. I think our pastoral team has done the best job

241
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,640
 to do things the Jesus way. I mean, Pastor John loves us with the Father's heart.

242
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,800
 Hi, Pastor John. And he's shown us in this last seven years, right, six, seven years,

243
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,920
 the servant's heart, the Father's heart. And, you know, Pastor James, Pastor

244
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,040
 Michelle, Pastor Josh, when he was here, really tried to build up those clans,

245
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:14,880
 the disciples, to become more like...build us up in these clans so that we become

246
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:24,600
 more like Jesus. And as the outreach and missions pastor, we've gone to Cambodia

247
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,920
 twice, we've gone to Philippines twice, we've gone to Taiwan twice, we just came

248
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:36,400
 back. We tried to reach out with the love of Jesus, to value the people in the

249
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:44,200
 different countries, just like Jesus. We've seen people raised up to become

250
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,680
 leaders, our worship leaders,

251
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:58,760
 to lead like Jesus, to exemplify Jesus in their worship leading. We've seen our G5,

252
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:07,120
 the next generation of leaders, come and preach and preach on Jesus. Gabe, Paul,

253
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:17,440
 Julian, Bonnie, others, Anthony, if he's still G5. We've seen these guys grow up

254
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:27,680
 and preach and be built up just like Jesus, preaching like Jesus, speaking of

255
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:35,200
 Jesus. And we've seen all of you, we've seen people come to know

256
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,840
 Jesus in our congregation.

257
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:48,200
 Charlotte came to know Jesus. Kathy knew Jesus through here. Mark, the kid who came

258
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,180
 to Taiwan with us, right? They came to know Jesus--not this Mark, he's still on his

259
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:03,920
 phone. Some things never change in the last seven years. We've seen people come

260
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:11,480
 to know Jesus, go on their first mission trip, share the gospel. Charlotte went to

261
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,440
 Uganda, Kathy's been on, I don't know, three or four mission trips. Mark went to

262
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,320
 Taiwan for the first time, shared the gospel, led people to know Jesus through

263
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,080
 the mission trips. We've seen our worship leaders grow up

264
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,560
 before our eyes, right? So that I don't need to do it anymore. You remember when

265
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:44,720
 I used to lead? I was still skinny back then and had long hair, right? And so I

266
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,520
 think that in our last seven, six, seven years, we've done everything that we

267
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:59,360
 could as our pastoral team to lead us in the Jesus way, amen? And I believe as

268
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:07,920
 Pastor James takes over and we move to Sunday, we'll continue going towards the

269
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,400
 Jesus way. And I so look forward to that. I look forward to my sabbatical first. I

270
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,160
 look forward to putting mud on my eyes in Israel. Maybe I'll be able to see

271
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:28,880
 further and clearer. And as Pastor James says, we don't exactly know the

272
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:37,640
 way, but we know the way maker. And that's why I've chosen this song for us, just to

273
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:45,840
 give thanks and to look forward at the same time. And so let's all stand. I

274
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:55,400
 believe Jesus is in our midst. Let's worship as Jesus does. Let's worship him

275
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:04,200
 as the blind man did, giving thanks, giving praise for the only one that is

276
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,000
 worthy. Let us respond and close that Jesus is the way maker. Heavenly Father,

277
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,560
 we give you thanks. Let's all raise our hands. We give you all the glory. You are

278
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:28,880
 our healer. You make the blind see the death here. You know our weaknesses and

279
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:39,160
 you heal our weaknesses in your time, in your way. You've led us as our shepherd

280
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:46,720
 in this last seven years with Pastor John as our Moses. And we thank you for

281
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,720
 Pastor James as he'll lead us as our Joshua through the next series period of

282
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,240
 time. We believe Lord you've led us through this way and that you're

283
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:13,480
 continuing to guide us. You are the perfect, the only, the healing, guiding, the

284
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:22,840
 miracle worker, the way maker. Hallelujah. Amen.

285
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:32,840
