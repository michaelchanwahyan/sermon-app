1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 (audio cuts out)

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,080
 Open up this word.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,920
 Actually, what did you think

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,920
 you were coming here for this evening?

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,240
 Were you just kind of filling in a gap

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
 just before your reservation?

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,300
 Or is this just what you do,

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,740
 or your parents tell you to come, whatever it might be?

9
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,040
 I think when it comes to church, for me,

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,820
 I'm getting this deeper and deeper sense

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,440
 of gratitude and reverence as to we're coming here

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,940
 because we're gathered here for Him.

13
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,780
 We're gathered here for Him,

14
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,200
 and it's not even the speaker, the sermon,

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,560
 or the great songs that we just sang.

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,080
 We're gathered here for Him.

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,800
 And do you recognize that?

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,720
 Do you truly believe that?

19
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,560
 Is that what you're here for?

20
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,480
 Is that what you're hungry and thirsty for?

21
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,440
 This can't just be a routine thing,

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
 'cause if it's just a routine thing,

23
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,480
 and you're sitting here just because

24
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,720
 your dinner reservation is at 7.30,

25
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,720
 then actually, I don't think it'll be any good for you.

26
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,200
 But if you come expectant for the Holy Spirit

27
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,520
 to speak into your life,

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,440
 if you come being ready to be pointed to Jesus

29
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,880
 and to be embraced by the Father's love,

30
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,980
 I think then the Lord has something for you this evening.

31
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,500
 Amen?

32
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
 And now we've been going through,

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,100
 you've been going through parables.

34
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,700
 I love parables, stories.

35
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,140
 Jesus was the greatest storyteller.

36
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,980
 He chose to use stories because it's through the stories

37
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,540
 that we get to remember things.

38
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,140
 We watch movies for the same reason.

39
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,780
 We get to see these stories lived out,

40
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,780
 and we kind of resonate with them,

41
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,220
 and we remembered them.

42
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,780
 And now we're like, "Oh, mustard seed.

43
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,420
 "It's about that."

44
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,020
 And then so Jesus uses stories,

45
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,920
 and He also uses it in them to help those

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,860
 who are really genuinely hungry for Him to get something.

47
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,060
 Because we all know what it's like to be spoon-fed

48
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,500
 and forced just morals and teachings and Bible verses,

49
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,940
 and you remember them just for that second,

50
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,340
 and then you don't live them out anymore

51
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,220
 because you've forgotten about them

52
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,260
 because you didn't go and get it yourself.

53
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,580
 So Jesus tells stories

54
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,100
 so that the people who really want to,

55
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,940
 the people who have a soft and open heart,

56
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,460
 will then go, "Okay, Jesus, what is that about?"

57
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,500
 And of course, with stories,

58
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,300
 there's always a moral to the story, right?

59
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,660
 That you think, "Okay, so that's what it's about."

60
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,860
 And so that's why He tells stories,

61
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,080
 and I love this story here.

62
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
 It's only a short one.

63
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,740
 I was gonna read it,

64
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,760
 but it looks like the video already read it for me.

65
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,680
 This is an interesting one because Jesus starts the story,

66
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,920
 and actually, the one just before,

67
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,720
 the parable just before was talking about prayer.

68
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,560
 He's saying, "You need to be persistent in your prayer.

69
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,960
 "You can't just give up after one trial.

70
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,260
 "You've gotta be persistent.

71
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,080
 "It's gotta be a continual relationship."

72
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
 And then He does, He jumps into another parable,

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,000
 another story, and He starts with saying,

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,480
 "Two men walk into a bar."

75
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,960
 Well, this is not two men walk into a bar.

76
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,540
 He says, "Two men walk into a temple."

77
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,260
 And He basically contrasts two men,

78
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,420
 the Pharisee and the tax collector.

79
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,660
 Now, you and I know these two men fairly well,

80
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,220
 or at least what they represent.

81
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,260
 And today, we're gonna go through this passage,

82
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,420
 and we're gonna see, actually,

83
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,460
 Jesus, what were you actually talking about here?

84
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,280
 And what I'm gonna do,

85
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,500
 because there's only really six verses,

86
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,740
 what I propose that we do is actually,

87
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,580
 we go through these six verses one by one.

88
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,860
 As we go through them, we'll glean what we can

89
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,060
 from actually what is the bigger picture at play here?

90
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,880
 What is Jesus talking about?

91
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,000
 What's the context in which He's talking from and to?

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,520
 And after that, we'll draw out some practical applications

93
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,440
 just before we go and eat,

94
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,960
 so hopefully that we can remember them,

95
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,560
 and actually really be able to apply them to our lives.

96
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,600
 Is that good?

97
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,560
 So let's go.

98
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,920
 Verse nine, He says this.

99
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,840
 This is the word of the Lord.

100
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
 "He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves

101
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,320
 "that they were righteous,

102
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,400
 "and treated others with contempt."

103
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
 Thank you for putting that up.

104
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,320
 I totally forgot to do this.

105
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,240
 I need to remember.

106
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,600
 Okay.

107
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,100
 So, I love this, because in other passages,

108
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,620
 we have to first figure out what the context is.

109
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,700
 When Paul writes a passage, we've got to figure out,

110
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,820
 oh, what is the context?

111
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,700
 Who's he writing to?

112
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,400
 Why is he talking to them about this?

113
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,380
 But here, Luke goes out of his way

114
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,740
 to tell us who he's writing to.

115
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,620
 He makes it very clear.

116
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,240
 He's saying, "He told this parable

117
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,180
 "to those who trusted in themselves

118
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,180
 "that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt."

119
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,140
 We're told the audience.

120
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,880
 We're told the context.

121
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,740
 What's the context?

122
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,300
 He's talking to people who are proud.

123
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,520
 We're talking to people who are prideful here,

124
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
 and you're looking at yourself,

125
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,680
 okay, well, this is a good context,

126
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,720
 and of course, at the very end,

127
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,100
 if we just fast forward to the end,

128
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,820
 for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,

129
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,500
 and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.

130
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,560
 So, we know this is about pride,

131
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,000
 but then, why don't we just say,

132
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,620
 hey, guys, stop being prideful.

133
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,460
 That's it.

134
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,280
 End of sermon.

135
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
 Let's pray.

136
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
 Let's go.

137
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,780
 There's more to it.

138
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,020
 And so, as we look at this, we look at, okay,

139
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,800
 people who trusted in themselves,

140
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,340
 people who actually are, hmm, I think I can do it.

141
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,000
 I think I'm a good person.

142
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,600
 If you keep pulling that all the way back to the end,

143
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
 this is Adam and Eve.

144
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,320
 Adam and Eve didn't trust God.

145
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,640
 That's the original sin, right?

146
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,840
 What is the original sin

147
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,240
 that has led to all these other sins?

148
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
 The original sin was,

149
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,100
 God, I'm not sure I can really trust you.

150
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,500
 I think I'm gonna trust myself.

151
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,120
 I think I'm gonna eat the apple.

152
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,440
 I think I wanna know the difference

153
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,120
 between right and wrong myself.

154
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,560
 I'm gonna trust in myself,

155
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,360
 and that they were righteous.

156
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,680
 We don't use that word that much anymore, right?

157
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
 What context do we use the word?

158
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,400
 When was the last time you heard the word righteous,

159
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,980
 apart from the pulpit?

160
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,560
 The word righteous is often used in a negative tone.

161
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,560
 That person is so self-righteous, so stuck up,

162
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,120
 so full of themselves.

163
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,080
 But of course, that's not what the word righteous

164
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
 wants to bring out, the original meaning.

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
 If you were to search it in the dictionary,

166
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,200
 it would be to be morally right, or just, to be good.

167
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,040
 And so then you think, oh, well, actually, I'm good.

168
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,200
 I'm a pretty good person.

169
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
 But that's actually just half of it.

170
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,480
 The problem here is, these guys that he's telling the story

171
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,320
 to trusted in themselves and thought they were righteous,

172
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,740
 so they were self-righteous,

173
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,460
 because they didn't really understand the true,

174
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,840
 the deeper spiritual meaning of the word righteous,

175
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,600
 which is, if you are to be righteous, as the Bible says it,

176
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,020
 it is to be right in the eyes of God.

177
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,440
 It is to be right in the eyes of God.

178
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,540
 How does the Bible describe righteousness?

179
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,640
 It is an attribute of God.

180
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,520
 It is perfection.

181
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
 It is the holiness of God,

182
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,480
 and you cannot attain it yourself.

183
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,880
 The problem is, these people he's talking to

184
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,320
 have decided they can trust in themselves,

185
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,140
 that they can declare themselves good and perfect.

186
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,020
 What does that mean?

187
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,680
 They have severed their own connection between them and God.

188
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,720
 They're like, God, we know you're up there,

189
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,680
 but actually, I think we're gonna not trust you.

190
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,040
 I think we're gonna trust in ourselves, thank you very much.

191
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,920
 And so they've completely severed that connection there.

192
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,880
 And then it carries on.

193
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,920
 And then it says that they were righteous

194
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,120
 and treated others with contempt.

195
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,760
 Pride, here's the danger of pride.

196
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,520
 And we're gonna be talking about pride this whole evening.

197
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,200
 Not only does it sever your connection with God,

198
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,160
 it severs your connection with others.

199
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
 You're treating others with contempt now.

200
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,000
 They're looking down on other people.

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
 So that's what he's talking about here.

202
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,640
 And here's the problem.

203
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,840
 The whole Christian faith is about

204
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,040
 how do we love God and love our neighbor?

205
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,920
 The whole nature of grace is one of,

206
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,440
 it's almost, it's paradoxical.

207
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,640
 How do you receive grace?

208
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,680
 You must be willing to give it.

209
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,840
 Jesus, in his sermon, Matthew 5, said,

210
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
 "Blessed are those who are merciful,

211
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,480
 "for they shall receive mercy."

212
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,880
 So if you're not merciful, then you may not receive mercy.

213
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
 When he teaches them how to pray,

214
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
 later in that sermon, he says, this is how you pray.

215
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
 Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,320
 At the very end, he finishes, and we all ignore it

217
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,960
 because it's not as catchy as,

218
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,800
 yours is the kingdom forever and ever, amen.

219
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,520
 It's forgive others as you have been given.

220
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,960
 'Cause if you don't forgive others, what will happen?

221
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,400
 Your Father in heaven won't forgive you.

222
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,720
 Grace is paradoxical in its nature.

223
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,640
 In order for us to receive it,

224
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,840
 we must be willing to give it.

225
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,040
 So pride is dangerous.

226
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
 That's what he's talking about.

227
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,840
 That's the context.

228
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,760
 Verse 10, he goes, this is his version of two men.

229
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,320
 Now we hear this, right?

230
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,600
 We hear the two men walk into a bar joke.

231
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,760
 Two men walk into a bar, an Englishman, an Irishman,

232
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,160
 and then goes the joke that really ridicules the Irishman

233
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,840
 because they're perceived as being not as smart,

234
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,720
 whatever it might be.

235
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,840
 Or the two kinds of people memes that you see online.

236
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,720
 There are two kinds of people in this world,

237
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,480
 those who are married and those who are happy.

238
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,320
 Those kind of...

239
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,840
 (audience laughing)

240
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,240
 Happily married, by the way, okay?

241
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
 It's just, that's a joke, okay?

242
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
 It's a joke.

243
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,560
 Christina, it's a joke.

244
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,400
 Okay.

245
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,520
 There are two kinds of people in the world,

246
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,640
 those who love to talk and those who hate to listen.

247
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,600
 Okay, so Jesus is kind of, but we remember those things

248
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,280
 because they bring about a contrast between two people,

249
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
 right?

250
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,480
 And so he goes, "Hey, let me tell you something.

251
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,640
 "Let me tell you a story."

252
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
 Two men walk into a temple to pray.

253
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,600
 There's the Pharisee and there's the tax collector.

254
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,840
 We are familiar with these two people

255
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,000
 because we've heard about them.

256
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
 If you've been in church for a certain amount of time,

257
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
 you will know that these two people,

258
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
 they represent certain things.

259
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,920
 The tax collector is a sinner.

260
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,080
 He betrayed his people to get more money.

261
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
 He worked for the enemy to collect money

262
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,720
 and to take a lot for himself.

263
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,920
 So we know the tax collector is not a good man.

264
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,680
 The Pharisee, we also know is not a good man.

265
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,360
 There's songs about not being a Pharisee

266
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
 and not being a Sadducee.

267
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,720
 So we know that the Pharisees are a bunch of stuck up people

268
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
 in the church that actually Jesus

269
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,520
 was very much pushing against.

270
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,400
 But here's the thing.

271
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,960
 When Jesus was telling this parable,

272
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,080
 the listener at the time, the readers at the time,

273
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
 may not have thought that

274
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,880
 because they don't have the benefit of us

275
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,400
 having studied the gospels for all these years.

276
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,520
 So in some ways, we need to understand

277
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,320
 what they were thinking when Jesus was telling the story,

278
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,720
 'cause then we can understand

279
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 why Jesus was telling the story to them like this.

280
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
 Does that make sense?

281
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,120
 So he says, "Two men walk into a temple to pray,

282
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,600
 "a Pharisee and a tax collector."

283
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,320
 We know both are bad guys.

284
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,800
 We know both are fall short.

285
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 But for the people listening,

286
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
 they would have been like, "Ah, the tax collector.

287
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,320
 "Oh, bad guy, we hate tax collectors.

288
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,400
 "A Pharisee, oh, influential guy,

289
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,280
 "rich guy, disciplined guy, knows his scripture well,

290
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,280
 "keeps the law, has a lot of power, looking up to him."

291
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,840
 That's what a Pharisee would have been perceived.

292
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,800
 I don't know, what's the modern day?

293
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,600
 Two men walk in, if I start telling you a joke of some sort,

294
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,080
 and it's two men walk into a church,

295
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,840
 it's a pastor and a, what's an occupation

296
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,720
 that doesn't offend people if I say it?

297
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,440
 Oh, that's... (audience laughing)

298
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,280
 Two men walk into a church,

299
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,600
 a pastor and a used car salesman.

300
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,600
 Like, sorry, or insurance salesman or banker.

301
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,320
 I'm only saying that 'cause John used to be one.

302
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
 You get what I mean?

303
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
 So straight away, if you're sat there,

304
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,320
 you're like, "Okay, two men walk into a church,

305
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,920
 "a pastor and a used car salesman."

306
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
 You go, "Oh, please don't be offended, used car salesman.

307
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,880
 "I love you, though I do not trust you, absolutely."

308
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
 You straight away think,

309
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,680
 "Okay, I think I know where he's going with this, right?"

310
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
 And so that's what these people are thinking.

311
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
 "Okay, he's trying to show us something

312
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,640
 "about the tax collector that we need to learn,

313
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,320
 "because surely a Pharisee is a very good person."

314
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,680
 And he says, "These two people go in and they pray."

315
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,960
 And then it carries on.

316
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,940
 I am terrible, terrible with the slides.

317
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,780
 Sorry, by the way.

318
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,680
 Thank you very much for paying attention more than I am.

319
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
 I'm just gonna give up now.

320
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,640
 I'm gonna leave it there.

321
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,120
 Verse 11 to 12.

322
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,980
 The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus,

323
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,880
 "God, I thank you that I am not like other men,

324
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,420
 "extortioners, unjust, adulterers,

325
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,180
 "or even like this tax collector.

326
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,120
 "I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I get."

327
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,860
 And so this guy is basically saying,

328
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,520
 "Hey, thank you."

329
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,600
 Now, first of all, he separates himself.

330
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,760
 He stands by himself.

331
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,880
 And you saw in the video,

332
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,680
 he stands in a prominent place in the temple,

333
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,600
 then he says, "God, thank you."

334
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,020
 By the way, that's the only time he talks to God.

335
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,700
 "God," he starts, and then he says,

336
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,560
 "Thank you for how amazing I am.

337
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,080
 "Thank you, God, that you made me so good."

338
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,560
 And he separates himself completely from everyone else.

339
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,460
 Now, separates himself just enough

340
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,540
 so that other people can still hear him talking.

341
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,440
 And so he's like, "I am so glad, God.

342
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
 "I am so glad that you didn't make me like that.

343
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,780
 "I am just so proud that you made me the way I am."

344
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,540
 Now, just before I continue to stamp on the Pharisee,

345
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,380
 let me tell you something.

346
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,120
 There is something that's actually good about them.

347
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,200
 The origins of where the Pharisees even came about

348
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,560
 is a group of people who looked at society,

349
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
 looked at culture, and were like,

350
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,960
 "We cannot keep following all this.

351
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,880
 "Paganism is overtaking our culture.

352
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,100
 "Hellenistic beliefs are taking over our culture.

353
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,380
 "Gnosticism is taking over our culture.

354
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
 "We must stand firm.

355
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,560
 "We must know the truth.

356
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,740
 "We must live the truth.

357
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,060
 "We must memorize the truth.

358
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,700
 "We must live this way.

359
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,260
 "We must be holy.

360
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,300
 "We must be set apart."

361
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,340
 Those are good things, right?

362
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,100
 And so they're saying, "We must be different."

363
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,060
 You know what we must be?

364
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,840
 We must be in this world,

365
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,900
 but we must not be of this world.

366
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,720
 Pharisees, fellow Pharisees, gather together.

367
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,180
 Let's keep to ourselves because we know the truth,

368
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,520
 and we need to live by it to the highest standard

369
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,680
 we possibly, possibly can.

370
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,340
 That's pretty good, right?

371
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,580
 So they are good intentions.

372
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,560
 But then somewhere along the line,

373
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,580
 and this happens with all of humanity, all of us do this.

374
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,860
 We start off with good intentions,

375
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
 and then it slowly, slowly just starts to go down.

376
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,420
 We start off here, and then suddenly

377
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,660
 our hearts start to get hard.

378
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,500
 And before you know it, what was good intentions

379
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 in the first place now have become,

380
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,700
 their hearts have become hardened,

381
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,020
 and they've become obnoxious.

382
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,860
 They were supposed to be set apart,

383
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,260
 but now they've set themselves above.

384
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,220
 That's the problem.

385
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,580
 And that's what pride does.

386
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,140
 Pride looks at other people,

387
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,500
 and then he starts talking to himself,

388
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,900
 and he starts saying, "Hey, I have so many things

389
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,220
 "I'm thankful for, God, because of the way you've made me."

390
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,940
 He's not talking to God at all.

391
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,140
 He's saying, he may have started off saying God,

392
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,820
 but then he's really talking to himself.

393
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
 He's talking for himself, by himself, to himself.

394
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,340
 This is all about him.

395
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,100
 Now, the good thing is, this is where I do remember,

396
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,700
 the good thing is, I'm glad he did that,

397
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,140
 because I'm not sure God really had that much to say to him.

398
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,780
 D.L. Moody has this thing that says,

399
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,140
 "God has nothing to say to the self-righteous."

400
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,740
 And so actually, it's very well

401
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,020
 that the Pharisee isn't talking to God,

402
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,340
 because I don't think God is talking to him,

403
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,780
 because God only talks to the people

404
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,700
 who are willing to listen,

405
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,980
 who humble themselves to be wanting to hear his voice.

406
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,100
 But the Pharisees here, they are completely going one way.

407
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,940
 He's saying, "I am so disciplined.

408
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,020
 "I am so disciplined.

409
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,620
 "I fast twice a week."

410
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,460
 Do you know how often they actually needed to fast?

411
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,220
 Once a year, once a year.

412
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,060
 The holiest Jewish day, the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur.

413
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,380
 They needed to fast once a year.

414
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,460
 And he's like, "But I'm fasting twice a week."

415
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,420
 My math isn't great,

416
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,500
 but that means I'm doing 100 times more

417
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,260
 than what I'm supposed to be doing.

418
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
 Aren't I amazing?

419
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,540
 Tithing, I'm tithing on everything.

420
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,820
 They were only supposed to tithe

421
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,780
 off the food that they got, the crops.

422
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,460
 But he's like, "God, I'm not even just tithing my food.

423
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,140
 "I'm not even just tithing my shake shack.

424
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,980
 "I'm gonna tithe everything.

425
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,140
 "I'm gonna tithe my salary.

426
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,980
 "I'm gonna tithe my house.

427
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,260
 "I'm gonna tithe any income that I get.

428
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,700
 "I'm gonna tithe my children.

429
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,620
 "I'm gonna tithe everything,

430
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,940
 "because I am so generous, God.

431
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,660
 "I'm more disciplined than any

432
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,980
 "of these other people down here.

433
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,100
 "I'm more generous than all these people here."

434
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,060
 That's what he's saying.

435
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,340
 But God doesn't have anything to say

436
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,860
 to the self-righteous.

437
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,260
 And then we go to the tax collector, verse 13.

438
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,860
 Oh, sorry.

439
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,180
 But the tax collector,

440
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,980
 but the tax collector, standing far off,

441
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,060
 would not even lift up his eyes to heaven,

442
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,260
 but beat his breast, saying,

443
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,980
 "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."

444
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,580
 We have one guy who walks into the temple to pray,

445
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,900
 and he stands right in the middle,

446
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,820
 separates himself from the other people.

447
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,700
 He says, "God," and then just blurts out his whole CV

448
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,380
 of how amazing he is.

449
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,620
 There's another guy, the used car salesman,

450
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,220
 who comes into the temple,

451
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,220
 but he can't even look up.

452
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,580
 Now, you're supposed to be standing to pray.

453
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,540
 That was the common thing back then, to stand and pray.

454
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,500
 But he gets into the temple,

455
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,940
 but he can't even look up, so he looks down.

456
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,420
 And more than that, he starts beating his breast.

457
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,300
 I don't know if you've done this.

458
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,900
 I tried this as I was practicing and preparing this sermon.

459
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,500
 It actually hurts quite, everyone try it, gently, though,

460
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 especially if you're nearly turning 70.

461
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,820
 Just do it really gentle.

462
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,660
 (audience laughing)

463
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,940
 All right, just do it over, he can't hear me.

464
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,020
 There you go, beating.

465
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,340
 Why is he beating his breast?

466
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,420
 Why is he beating his chest?

467
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,580
 When have you beat your breast?

468
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,380
 When you are in absolute despair.

469
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,380
 When your heart is just so overcome by guilt and shame,

470
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,220
 just completely broken, you're like,

471
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,900
 "Oh, I am such a wretched sinner.

472
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,820
 "I am such a wreck."

473
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,740
 Can we understand a little bit

474
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,300
 of what the tax collector's going through here?

475
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,580
 He didn't actually need to go to the temple.

476
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,340
 Judging by who he is,

477
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,900
 he knows that every time he walks around

478
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,020
 in anywhere in that vicinity,

479
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,060
 he's gonna be looked upon and judged upon.

480
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,180
 He doesn't need to be there, and he's not a good person.

481
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,100
 Let's not suddenly turn him into an angel.

482
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,180
 He's a tax collector.

483
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,820
 He knows he's a sinner,

484
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,820
 but he's so overcome by his own guilt.

485
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,940
 He doesn't just stay at home,

486
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,020
 he's like, "I have to do something,

487
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,000
 "but I don't know what to do,

488
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,160
 "so I'm gonna drag myself.

489
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,980
 "I'm gonna climb up those stairs to the temple.

490
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,340
 "I'm gonna stand there, but now I'm here.

491
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,020
 "I don't even know what to say.

492
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,440
 "I don't even dare look up,

493
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,420
 "so I'm just gonna beat my chest."

494
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,780
 That's the desperation that he has.

495
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,260
 He's like, "I am a sinner.

496
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,220
 "I have no, have you been there?"

497
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,020
 Where you're just like, "I am at my end.

498
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,580
 "I don't know how I can save myself.

499
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,940
 "I need help."

500
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,140
 But then you get there, and you come to church,

501
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,880
 and everyone's raising their hands and jumping around,

502
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,440
 and you're just like, "I can't.

503
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,860
 "I can't, I'm just, have you been there?"

504
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,600
 That's what the tax collector is.

505
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,640
 And then he says, "Be merciful to me, a sinner."

506
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,620
 He doesn't say any more than that.

507
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,200
 He doesn't have any CV worth sharing.

508
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,920
 He just says, "Be merciful to me, a sinner."

509
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,500
 Now, when he says, "Be merciful to me,"

510
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,000
 he's actually, in the original language,

511
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,400
 it's not just, "God, would you just show me mercy?

512
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
 "Would you just look away?

513
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,520
 "Actually, would you just make an exception for me,

514
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,920
 "lower the bar so that I can step in today?

515
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,540
 "Lord, can you just let me off the hook?"

516
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,440
 That's not what he's saying.

517
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,560
 The original, the original meaning of this is

518
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,040
 not just, "Show mercy to me," it's, "Be merciful to me."

519
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,880
 It's, "Apply atonement to me.

520
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,540
 "Make me right.

521
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,220
 "God, be merciful to me.

522
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,200
 "I am a sinner, and I can't do anything to save myself.

523
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,640
 "I know I need saving.

524
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,200
 "Would you apply atonement to me?

525
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,020
 "I am disconnected from you,

526
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,280
 "and I don't know how to get back.

527
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,400
 "But would you reach down and apply atonement to me?"

528
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,980
 "Be merciful to me and save me."

529
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,800
 That's what he's saying.

530
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,660
 He's saying, "I need to be saved, but I don't know how.

531
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,160
 "And I know you can do it, and I can't.

532
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,740
 "So would you be merciful to me, a sinner?"

533
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,920
 That's what he's saying.

534
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,660
 And then we reach, really, the final,

535
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,420
 the central axiom of this little parable here.

536
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,860
 Verse 14, he says, "I tell you this.

537
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,420
 "I tell you, this man went down to his house justified,

538
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,460
 "made right, right in the eyes of God,

539
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,540
 "rather than the other.

540
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
 "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,

541
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,380
 "but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."

542
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,180
 Now, we're not just talking about Pharisees anymore.

543
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,020
 He's saying everyone.

544
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,060
 Everyone who humbles themselves will be exalted,

545
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,000
 will be justified, will be saved.

546
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,540
 And those who declare themselves,

547
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,300
 who trust in themselves, who think they're righteous,

548
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,060
 who think they're good, they will be humbled.

549
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,860
 The whole point of this is humility.

550
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,860
 And he's saying, "Anyone who comes to God

551
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,780
 "with a lowly heart, emptying himself, God will fill.

552
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,780
 "But anyone who comes with pride, you will be humbled."

553
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,700
 Another D.L. Moody quote says this.

554
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,300
 "God sends no one away empty,

555
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,740
 "except those who are full of themselves."

556
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,300
 God sends no one away empty,

557
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,940
 except those who are full of themselves.

558
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,140
 'Cause why does he need to do anything?

559
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,340
 The Pharisee doesn't need anything from God.

560
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,100
 In fact, it sounds like God needs to interview with him.

561
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,740
 But if you humble yourself,

562
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,580
 if you recognize that you actually need to be filled,

563
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,820
 if you recognize that you actually need to be saved,

564
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,180
 then we're talking.

565
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,020
 The problem here is this, and Spurgeon says this.

566
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,620
 "The greatest enemy to human souls

567
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,060
 "is the self-righteous spirit,

568
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,420
 "which makes men look to themselves for salvation."

569
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,140
 There was a quote earlier that I forgot to share.

570
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,860
 Actually, self-righteousness is the devil's masterpiece

571
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,820
 in letting you think better of yourself,

572
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,620
 that you think you are good enough.

573
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,380
 That pride, that is the most toxic, dangerous thing

574
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,580
 that we can have as the church.

575
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,460
 When we say, "We're good, we're good, we're doing all right.

576
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,460
 "We don't need a savior."

577
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,740
 But the whole point is that we do.

578
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,180
 The whole point is that we do.

579
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,020
 So what we humble ourselves is what we're saying here.

580
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,820
 Final one, "There is no pride so dangerous,

581
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,060
 "none so subtle and insidious as the pride of holiness."

582
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,900
 There is no pride as toxic as self-righteousness.

583
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,540
 And so we know that.

584
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,500
 And so yes, we can go away and we can say,

585
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,700
 "Okay, well, I will try not to be prideful."

586
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
 But what are we actually really gleaning from this

587
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,900
 that we can actually apply?

588
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,780
 As we look at how the Pharisee prays,

589
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,500
 as we look at how the tax collector prays,

590
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,420
 as we think about why Jesus told the story

591
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,980
 in the first place, what can we really glean from it?

592
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,940
 And I think there's a couple of things

593
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,820
 that I think would be helpful for us.

594
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,100
 The first thing is this.

595
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,820
 You or me, we should not be the focus of our prayer.

596
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,780
 We should not be the focus of our prayer.

597
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,220
 Have a think right now when you pray,

598
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,300
 when you pray on your own or when in a small group,

599
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,180
 what are the things that fill your mind?

600
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,980
 What are the things that you talk about?

601
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,500
 God, Father, God, thank you.

602
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,100
 And I've got all these things I need to request of you.

603
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,820
 God, can you help me live a more comfortable life?

604
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,340
 Can you help me get the job that I want to have?

605
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,060
 Can you help me be rid of this illness already

606
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,860
 would you help me find a spouse?

607
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,700
 Would you help me do this?

608
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
 Would you help me have things go smooth

609
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,540
 and your timing is always good so it's working out?

610
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,020
 Because I really want to get on that holiday,

611
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,220
 completely healthy with all my work done

612
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,260
 and so I can have a really nice ski trip.

613
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,580
 When you pray, are you the focus of your prayer?

614
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,420
 Or is it him?

615
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,060
 Jesus teaches them how to pray.

616
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,220
 And he says, our Father in heaven,

617
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,460
 hallowed be your name, your kingdom come,

618
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,820
 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

619
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,780
 There is nothing about personal requests.

620
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,580
 There is nothing about personal bragging there at all.

621
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,060
 It is all about him.

622
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,060
 We should not be the focus of our prayer.

623
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,460
 A theologian describes this parable,

624
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,380
 what Jesus is talking about.

625
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,740
 This Pharisee is basically glancing at God

626
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,140
 and contemplating himself.

627
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,740
 Do you do that?

628
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,580
 Do I do that?

629
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,980
 I think I often do.

630
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,660
 I'm so engrossed in my own personal circumstances,

631
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,380
 my own ambitions, my own desires,

632
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,460
 I glance at God and I'm completely contemplating myself.

633
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,500
 Where does that come from?

634
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,660
 Where does that come from?

635
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,700
 Why do we have that?

636
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,980
 I think ultimately it's because we want to live a life

637
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,180
 that looks good to everyone on the outside.

638
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,260
 Just like this Pharisee who walks at the temple

639
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,020
 and wants to show everyone how holy and how good he is.

640
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,100
 His prayer and his worship is completely focused on him.

641
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,140
 It's all about look at me.

642
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,300
 There's someone who said there are two kinds of people

643
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,660
 in the world, those who walk into a room and say,

644
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,940
 "There you are."

645
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,140
 And there are those who walk into a room and say,

646
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,020
 "Here I am."

647
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,660
 The Pharisee is the one who walks in and says,

648
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,500
 "Here I am."

649
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,940
 We are now in a culture where it is all about look at me.

650
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,780
 Look at me.

651
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,420
 Look at everything that I do.

652
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,700
 Look at my CV.

653
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,660
 I want you to accept me.

654
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,300
 I want you to admire me.

655
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,180
 I want you to adore me.

656
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,980
 Everything, I want you to just focus on me.

657
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,420
 9th of February, 2009,

658
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,980
 it's the day that mankind, we as a society,

659
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,740
 changed and not for the better.

660
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,420
 9th of February, 2009.

661
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,100
 Do you know what that day is?

662
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,260
 What happened that day?

663
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:19,540
 That was the day that Facebook invented the button like.

664
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,180
 (audience laughing)

665
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,020
 Like.

666
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
 Like.

667
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,540
 Ooh, like.

668
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,820
 Ooh, like.

669
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,100
 And now it's ooh, love.

670
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,340
 Ooh, ha ha.

671
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,820
 Ooh, and then they invented poke.

672
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,780
 Do you remember poke?

673
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,940
 That was annoying, wasn't it?

674
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,380
 I'm so glad that's disappeared now.

675
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,540
 Poke, poke you.

676
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,380
 Stop poking me.

677
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,700
 Poke, poke, stop poking me.

678
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,900
 Poke.

679
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,740
 Like.

680
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,260
 Before that, may it be we shared things about our lives

681
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,860
 on social media because we wanted to share with people

682
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,420
 just the stuff that we do in life.

683
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,980
 And then people comment on them and go,

684
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,540
 oh, that's so nice.

685
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,340
 And then the like button came.

686
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,140
 And now we share posts to get the likes.

687
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,100
 Now we share posts to get those comments.

688
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,380
 You look on social media now,

689
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,780
 and we all live on social media.

690
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,500
 Depending on your age will determine what app you're using,

691
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,000
 but we're all on social media.

692
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,700
 And you're all doing this, and we're all doing this,

693
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,820
 and we're all seeking approval.

694
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,420
 I'll tell you, I'll post something and I'll be like,

695
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,180
 ah, how many people liked my post?

696
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,220
 How many people responded to my story?

697
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,580
 How many people loved my story?

698
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,420
 Love it.

699
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,740
 Like, like.

700
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,100
 Look at me, look at me, look at me.

701
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,500
 How many of us have posted something,

702
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,140
 posted a bad picture of ourselves?

703
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,060
 Like really terrible.

704
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,180
 And actually, just as I said that,

705
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,480
 you two have posted a pretty ugly picture of yourselves.

706
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,280
 Respect, respect.

707
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,980
 But we don't, because we all want to show our best side.

708
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,740
 We all want to have the right angle,

709
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,640
 the right filter.

710
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,700
 Everything needs to be right.

711
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,220
 What we say in the caption has to be smart,

712
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,660
 and clever, and cool, and hip, and right.

713
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,780
 The latte that I'm drinking has to be perfectly lit,

714
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,940
 so when I share it, people will see how cool my life is.

715
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,780
 Right?

716
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,080
 Everything, and the people that I'm doing selfies with,

717
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,820
 everything is look at me, look at me.

718
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,380
 If we keep going back, what are we actually saying here?

719
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,380
 That need for approval.

720
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,320
 That need for the like.

721
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,060
 What are we saying here?

722
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,360
 We're craving attention.

723
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,700
 We're craving attention, why?

724
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,520
 Because we don't realize how much God loves us.

725
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,420
 It's like a child just crying out for the parents' attention.

726
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,120
 Hey, look at me, daddy, look at me, daddy, look at me.

727
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,000
 We say that.

728
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,100
 We act in a way to seek approval,

729
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,520
 because we don't believe our Father in heaven loves us,

730
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,960
 and is looking at us, and adores us.

731
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,740
 And so we go and find attention

732
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,960
 anywhere and everywhere else.

733
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,460
 But if we understood that,

734
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,620
 if we understood how much the Father loved us,

735
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,780
 that we don't need to seek anyone else's approval but his,

736
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,980
 I think we would stop doing things for show.

737
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,740
 I think we would live in a way that is completely free,

738
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,260
 because we know our Father in heaven loves us.

739
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,940
 I think some of us are more susceptible to this.

740
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,260
 Don't know how many of you love

741
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,820
 kind of like the personality tests

742
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,980
 and those kinds of things,

743
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,780
 and the Enneagram test is one of them.

744
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,260
 And I don't know too much about it now.

745
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,100
 I stopped looking at it,

746
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,340
 but I remember that when I did the test,

747
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,940
 I was an Enneagram three.

748
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,020
 Anyone want to know what an Enneagram three is?

749
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,860
 You do?

750
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,060
 The Achiever, the Achiever.

751
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,160
 And what I got out about personality tests was,

752
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,020
 if you're an Enneagram three, you're an Achiever,

753
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,020
 it means that you really care

754
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,000
 what other people think about you.

755
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,500
 So actually, you can take that one,

756
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,260
 you can keep that one every time I'm talking to you.

757
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,300
 I'm hoping that you like me.

758
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,700
 And so when I'm unhealthy, that's all I'm trying to do.

759
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,540
 I'm trying to get approval, trying to get compliments,

760
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
 trying people to like me.

761
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,160
 So when I'm, I've done this before.

762
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,700
 When I posted something up and I go back and see,

763
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,020
 I just want to see how many likes there are.

764
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,220
 I want to see who's liked my picture.

765
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,300
 I want to see why.

766
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,380
 So then I just want to be liked.

767
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,260
 That's when I'm unhealthy.

768
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,180
 But when I'm healthy, I realize, gosh,

769
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,100
 God loves me so much.

770
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,500
 He's always looking at me.

771
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,420
 I don't need any attention from anywhere else.

772
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,300
 So the focus of my worship,

773
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,140
 the focus of my prayer is not to show you guys

774
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,860
 how good I am, but it's just to tell him how good he is.

775
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,300
 Because I know that he's looking at me.

776
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,100
 We should not be the focus of our prayers.

777
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
 Now, Jesus talks about this,

778
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,220
 'cause he says in his sermon on the mountain again,

779
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,780
 he's saying, "Hey, when you do good things,

780
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,620
 "don't let your right hand know

781
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,660
 "what your left hand is doing.

782
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,440
 "When you're praying, don't stand on a street corner

783
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
 "and speak loudly with long words.

784
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,100
 "Your father who sees in secret knows.

785
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,880
 "You've already had your reward if you get all that.

786
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,820
 "You get all that manly praise.

787
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,660
 "So don't do that."

788
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
 And then he's saying to the other guys,

789
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,420
 and the gospel is saying,

790
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,660
 "Hey, you guys are just cleaning the outside of your cup,

791
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,200
 "but the inside is completely dirty.

792
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,780
 "You are worshiping me with your lips,

793
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,820
 "but your hearts are far from me."

794
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:00,380
 Your prayer, my worship, who's the focus?

795
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,460
 Are we glancing at God and contemplating ourselves,

796
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,920
 or are we truly freed from that need

797
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,100
 for approval from others?

798
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,120
 And are we focusing on the only one who's good?

799
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,860
 People often say there's two kinds of people in the world.

800
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,300
 There's good people and there's bad people.

801
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,100
 The movies seem to tell us that.

802
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,220
 There's the hero and there's the villain.

803
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,200
 The truth is, it isn't quite that simple.

804
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,220
 If anything, there are only two kinds of people

805
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,040
 in the world.

806
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,520
 There are lots and lots of bad people,

807
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,200
 and there's only one good person, Jesus.

808
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,560
 He should be the focus of our worship and prayer,

809
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,540
 not ourselves.

810
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,960
 The second thing is this.

811
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,360
 We should not compare ourselves to others.

812
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,960
 This Pharisee looks across at the tax collector and say,

813
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,860
 "God, I'm so thankful I'm not like him.

814
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,280
 "Dodged a bullet there.

815
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,480
 "Thank you for that, but I'm gonna take it from here now

816
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,120
 "and be the best person that I can be,

817
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,800
 "the greatest you ever lived,

818
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,540
 "but thank you that I didn't start off like him."

819
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,140
 Comparison is a dangerous thing.

820
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,140
 Comparison is a very dangerous thing, and we all compare.

821
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,180
 Studies say that we start comparing

822
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,580
 when we're seven years old.

823
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,120
 And I told you this story before.

824
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,500
 Reuben arrived when he was six when we came to Hong Kong,

825
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,880
 and then shortly after he turned seven,

826
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,720
 he'd look at me and go,

827
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,200
 "Daddy, why do people's cars open like this?

828
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,400
 (audience laughing)

829
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,280
 "That is so cool.

830
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,200
 "I've never seen that before.

831
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,780
 "Why does ours, wait, why don't we have a car?"

832
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,680
 (laughing)

833
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,580
 And I was like, "Oh, man, here we go."

834
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,680
 And comparison is dangerous, why?

835
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,200
 You'll never get out, you'll never get away from comparing

836
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,100
 without putting someone down and lifting someone up, never.

837
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,860
 Compare anything, even with like a neutral heart.

838
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,260
 You're basically saying, "Okay, which one's better, which?"

839
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,660
 You're asking for something to be put above

840
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,080
 and something to be placed beneath.

841
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,940
 It's the pride that it leads to,

842
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,340
 and it's a very dangerous thing.

843
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,620
 That's why we're told, when we're focusing on our life,

844
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,240
 just focus on the prize.

845
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,780
 Paul says, "I press on towards the goal

846
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,200
 "of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

847
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,060
 "I'm not looking at anything else."

848
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,940
 Do you remember sports day?

849
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,540
 For those of us who used to run in the long distance

850
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,440
 or the short distances,

851
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,740
 what are you told to do by a PE teacher and your parents?

852
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,860
 Don't look to the side, don't compare.

853
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,140
 Keep your eyes focused on here,

854
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,740
 'cause the moment you look here,

855
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,460
 you'll realize where they are, and it'll distract you.

856
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,260
 So comparison is a bad thing, do not compare.

857
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,460
 And we all fall short of this.

858
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,580
 Now, I don't think any of us are here like,

859
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,500
 "Oh, when I come to church, I look at some people

860
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,260
 "and I go, 'Oh, that person is so bad.

861
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,460
 "'They worship in such a weird way.

862
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,460
 "'They worship with their arms crossed, that's weird.'"

863
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,220
 I'm guessing that none of you do that.

864
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,880
 But then, actually, are there things that we,

865
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,600
 even as a church, are guilty of?

866
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,600
 This Pharisee is guilty of comparing in the temple.

867
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,360
 Do we have temple comparisons in this modern day?

868
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,840
 We do.

869
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,720
 Society is becoming more and more polarized in every way,

870
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,320
 and it's seeped into the church, right?

871
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,540
 There's all these different kinds of Christians now.

872
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,920
 There's evangelical Christians, there's charismatics,

873
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,400
 there's Presbyterians, there's liberal,

874
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,440
 there's conservative, there's progressive.

875
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,360
 I lose track of all the different names that we can have

876
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,980
 for different type of Christians, right?

877
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,520
 We've got the Presbyterians looking over

878
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,740
 at the charismatics and going,

879
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,180
 "Oh, those guys just worship with their heart,

880
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,200
 "and they're just all feely,

881
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,400
 "and they're singing choruses a hundred times,

882
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,720
 "and just never stop singing.

883
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,640
 "Finish the song already!"

884
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,040
 And you're not using your brain at all,

885
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,180
 and you're praying as though everything will happen,

886
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,740
 that God will grant you your request to everything.

887
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,500
 And then the charismatics are looking over

888
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,340
 at the Presbyterians and going,

889
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,580
 "You guys don't even use your heart at all.

890
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,860
 "You're just stone statues,

891
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,300
 "and you just filled your head with knowledge,

892
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,700
 "and you're praying as though nothing will ever happen."

893
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,460
 Of course, both those sides, forgive me, both sides.

894
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,740
 But we see, we look at that and go,

895
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,980
 "Oh, that church is so liberal,

896
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,100
 "that church is so conservative,

897
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,280
 "that church is so this, that church is so that.

898
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,120
 "Aren't we doing that?

899
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,340
 "That church sings this kind of music.

900
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,780
 "Oh, that church does this kind of theology."

901
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,560
 Every time we start comparing,

902
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,700
 what we're doing is we're trying to find a place

903
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,300
 where we can say we're superior and they're inferior.

904
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,740
 And that's the pride.

905
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,900
 That's the self-righteousness.

906
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,620
 That's us trusting in ourselves.

907
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,540
 That's saying, "Hey, we've got the right theology.

908
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,840
 "We've got the right way of worship.

909
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,460
 "We've got the right way to reach young people.

910
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,420
 "We've got the right way to reach old people."

911
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,300
 And you don't.

912
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,480
 Comparison is a dangerous thing, brothers and sisters.

913
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,320
 Don't compare.

914
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,820
 Our worship, our prayer does not need comparing.

915
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,100
 We're all beautifully made in very different ways,

916
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,620
 and we all worship in different ways,

917
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,340
 and we all process God and worship Him

918
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,220
 in very different ways.

919
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,140
 The Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians 14 says,

920
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,040
 "I worship with my mind and I worship with my spirit."

921
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,360
 We as a church, can we stop comparing?

922
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,580
 It's the whole mission of one church, right?

923
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,700
 Can we stop comparing?

924
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,860
 Can we just say, "We are made so beautifully different."

925
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,060
 We should not compare.

926
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,860
 Because Scripture tells us we need to look at others

927
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,120
 and go, "You're more significant than me."

928
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,980
 That's what Scripture is telling.

929
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,500
 But instead, we look at them and go,

930
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,540
 "Oh, out of our own insecurity,

931
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,300
 "we're trying to find their flaws."

932
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,060
 That's what we're doing, right?

933
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,140
 'Cause we don't feel that good about ourselves,

934
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,140
 but we're looking at other people and go,

935
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,180
 "Oh, well, they're even worse.

936
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,580
 "That makes me feel better."

937
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,260
 We should not be the focus of our prayer.

938
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,780
 We should not compare ourselves to others as well.

939
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,740
 And finally, we should not trust in ourselves.

940
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,420
 (baby crying)

941
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,540
 He's talking to a group of people

942
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,480
 who trusted in themselves, right?

943
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,980
 I was having lunch recently with someone, a dear friend,

944
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,940
 and we go for lunch a lot.

945
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,380
 And I'll say, "Hey, imagine if Jesus

946
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,440
 "walked through the door right now, how would you feel?

947
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,280
 "What would you do?"

948
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,120
 He's like, "Well, I feel pretty good about myself.

949
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,040
 "But I don't think I've done anything majorly wrong.

950
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,660
 "I don't think I've cheated, I've not killed anyone,

951
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,380
 "paid my taxes, I'm pretty good.

952
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,820
 "I've not done any major sins."

953
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,660
 I'm like, "Do you think that's gonna be enough?"

954
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,020
 He's like, "I think so."

955
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,860
 And I'm like, "I don't know,

956
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,280
 "I don't think it's gonna be enough

957
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,420
 "because we're not justified by our works."

958
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,460
 Today, literally today, as I was walking back home,

959
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,780
 the security guard shouts out to me,

960
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,740
 "Hey, Dan San, Mr. Tang, I heard you're a pastor."

961
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,300
 I said, "I am."

962
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
 He's like, "You don't look like a pastor."

963
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,660
 (audience laughing)

964
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,740
 I was like, "What does a pastor look like?"

965
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,860
 Only just today when I walked in,

966
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,020
 someone said I look more like a triad than a pastor.

967
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,860
 (audience laughing)

968
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,700
 Thank you, Paul.

969
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,740
 (Dan laughing)

970
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,340
 Just watch yourself.

971
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,340
 (audience laughing)

972
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,100
 And then he started talking to me,

973
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,620
 and then we had this 20-minute conversation

974
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,820
 with my security guard.

975
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,340
 And he was like, "Oh, well, oh yeah, yeah,

976
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,700
 "I believe in Jesus.

977
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,560
 "And actually, my primary school teacher told me this.

978
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,960
 "I went to a Catholic school."

979
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,980
 (speaking in foreign language)

980
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,900
 Like, good people go up there, bad people go down here.

981
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,020
 End of story.

982
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,820
 He's like, "Oh yeah, but I believe in Jesus,

983
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,460
 "and I believe that he lived and he died.

984
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,620
 "I get that, but yeah, good people up here,

985
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,460
 "bad people down here."

986
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,060
 And I said, "Oh, well, if it's good people up here

987
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,000
 "and bad people down here,

988
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
 "then why did Jesus have to die?

989
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,600
 "Because then you just, you'd be good,

990
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,240
 "and you make your choice, and you go here.

991
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,420
 "What was the whole point of Jesus dying?"

992
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,500
 He's like, "Hmm, I don't know.

993
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,780
 "Why is that?"

994
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,940
 I said, "Because I don't think any of us

995
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,300
 "will ever be good enough."

996
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,420
 Because we're talking perfection, right?

997
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,300
 We're talking the righteousness of God up here.

998
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,940
 You'll never reach that.

999
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,740
 Mother Teresa never reached that,

1000
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:31,100
 because there's bound to be some flaw in all of us,

1001
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,220
 because that's not it.

1002
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,380
 We're not justified by our work,

1003
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,260
 so we can't trust in ourselves.

1004
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,500
 There's a pastor here that says this.

1005
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,720
 "I believe that a great number of people

1006
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,080
 "are going to die and go to hell

1007
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,740
 "because they're counting on their religiosity

1008
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,640
 "in the church instead of their relationship with Jesus

1009
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,900
 "to get them to heaven.

1010
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,520
 "They will give lip service to repentance and faith,

1011
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,900
 "but they've never been born again."

1012
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,020
 Doesn't that send chills down your spine?

1013
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,060
 When I ask you, "Hey, how confident are you in Jesus?"

1014
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,100
 You're like, "Oh, well, I've been going to church.

1015
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,940
 "My attendance this month is 75%.

1016
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,880
 "Pretty good, no fail.

1017
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,720
 "I don't know if it's enough.

1018
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,220
 "Oh, I've been donating to charities.

1019
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,940
 "Pretty good, no, I don't know."

1020
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,340
 Because it's not about that.

1021
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,280
 The apostle Paul had the greatest CV, right?

1022
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,460
 He had the greatest CV in Philippians 3.

1023
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,960
 He says, "I was circumcised on the eighth day

1024
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,860
 "of the people of Israel.

1025
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,480
 "I was a Hebrew of Hebrews.

1026
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,840
 "As to the law, I was a Pharisee.

1027
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,680
 "I knew everything.

1028
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,540
 "I followed all the laws.

1029
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,360
 "I disciplined myself in every way,

1030
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,780
 "more than any other people.

1031
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,660
 "As to zeal, I persecuted the church.

1032
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,780
 "As to righteousness under the law, blameless."

1033
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,900
 And then he says the secret,

1034
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,180
 "But whatever gain I had, I count as loss

1035
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,280
 "because of the surpassing worth

1036
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,300
 "of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."

1037
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,600
 That's the thing that matters.

1038
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,580
 It's not what you do, it's who you know.

1039
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,900
 And it's only Jesus that will get you in.

1040
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,040
 Good people go down here, bad people down here.

1041
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,240
 That is wrong theology.

1042
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,400
 'Cause it doesn't work like that,

1043
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,300
 because you will never be good enough.

1044
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,880
 Jesus says only one person is good.

1045
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,320
 And he says, "Be perfect for your Father in heaven

1046
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,520
 "is perfect."

1047
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,080
 Now, if you're confident that you're gonna be perfect,

1048
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,000
 then good luck to you.

1049
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,760
 But for the rest of us, we need a savior.

1050
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,400
 We need someone to save us.

1051
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,960
 So do not trust in yourself.

1052
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,560
 And it's not how you look on the outside.

1053
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,860
 Can you tell from this Pharisee,

1054
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,000
 his perception of righteousness and of sin

1055
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,520
 was completely external.

1056
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,920
 The way he fasted, the way he donated,

1057
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,080
 the way he did everything, everything was external.

1058
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,320
 But what he didn't realize was that God looks at the heart.

1059
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,840
 One of my favorite books of recent times

1060
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,360
 is called "The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse."

1061
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,200
 Fantastic book.

1062
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,120
 And it has just, for those who don't like reading,

1063
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,400
 if this is the book for you,

1064
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,480
 there's like six words on each page.

1065
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,320
 Okay?

1066
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,960
 "The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, the Horse."

1067
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,360
 Incredible, my daughter absolutely loves it.

1068
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,720
 Written by a Christian, goes to HDB in London.

1069
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,560
 Incredible.

1070
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,120
 And if you really, really can't even read six words

1071
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
 on a page, it's on Apple TV.

1072
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,320
 30 minute cartoon.

1073
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
 It's incredible.

1074
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,360
 And it says this one thing, I think I've got it actually.

1075
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
 Isn't it odd?

1076
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,800
 So I think, I can't remember which character

1077
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,320
 was talking to which, but it says this.

1078
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,480
 Isn't it odd?

1079
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,080
 We can only see our outsides,

1080
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,440
 but nearly everything happens on the inside.

1081
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,680
 We can only see our outsides,

1082
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,120
 but nearly everything happens on the inside.

1083
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,960
 The Pharisee had an understanding of sin

1084
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,040
 and righteousness all external.

1085
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,960
 He didn't realize everything was internal.

1086
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,040
 The way we go about our faith is all about sin management.

1087
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,120
 My dear friend who was like,

1088
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,520
 I think it'll go okay if Jesus comes in.

1089
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,160
 He's thinking where the floor is.

1090
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,000
 Sin management, I'm not doing these things,

1091
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,840
 I'm gonna be okay.

1092
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,600
 But that's what Christianity is about.

1093
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,240
 Christianity isn't about sin management,

1094
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,680
 it's about striving up here.

1095
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,920
 It's about our heart.

1096
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,680
 It's about heart transformation

1097
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,960
 as opposed to behavior modification.

1098
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,680
 We should not be the focus of our prayer,

1099
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,040
 we should not compare ourselves to others,

1100
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,720
 and we cannot trust in ourselves.

1101
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
 What Jesus is saying here is,

1102
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
 those who think they are good won't get in.

1103
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,840
 Those who know they're wicked, they will.

1104
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,000
 Those who think they're good won't get in.

1105
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,440
 Those who know they won't, they will get in.

1106
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,160
 That's what he's saying.

1107
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,120
 Let me finish here.

1108
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,880
 When I shared with you what the tax collector said,

1109
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
 be merciful to me, a sinner.

1110
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,600
 Apply atonement to me, make me right.

1111
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,840
 I can't make myself right.

1112
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,440
 Apply atonement unto me.

1113
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,000
 Connect me back with you again, only you can do it.

1114
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,880
 That word there only happens twice in the New Testament.

1115
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,200
 One time is right here,

1116
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,740
 and another time is in Hebrews 2.17.

1117
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,920
 Therefore he had to be made like his brothers

1118
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,000
 in every respect so that he might become

1119
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,960
 a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God

1120
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,360
 to make propitiation for the sins of the people.

1121
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,000
 To make propitiation, to make right, to apply atonement.

1122
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,520
 That's the only other place this word comes up.

1123
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,840
 To be merciful.

1124
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,220
 It's saying, what he's saying here is,

1125
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,200
 not God, would you lower the bar so I can hop in?

1126
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,920
 He's saying, would you help me?

1127
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,720
 I am in deep need of atonement.

1128
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,120
 Would you come and save me?

1129
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,000
 Would you come and save me?

1130
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,400
 When you truly understand then what happens next,

1131
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,360
 that's what frees you.

1132
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,000
 Because how does he save you?

1133
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,600
 Jesus becomes the sinner for you.

1134
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,320
 For God made the one who knew no sin to be sin

1135
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,800
 so that we would receive what?

1136
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,720
 The righteousness of God.

1137
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,000
 Jesus became the sinner and took all of our sin

1138
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,600
 and paid all of our debt

1139
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,200
 so that we would have atonement applied onto us.

1140
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,940
 That we would be made right in him.

1141
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,000
 At the end of the day,

1142
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,800
 there are only two kinds of people in the world.

1143
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,400
 Those who are saved and those who are not.

1144
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,120
 Those who think they're good

1145
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,400
 and those who know they are wicked.

1146
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,420
 Those who think eternal life can be earned.

1147
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,100
 And those who know that it's a gift.

1148
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,600
 Those who seek God and people's commendation

1149
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,480
 and those who seek forgiveness.

1150
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,080
 Those who are still dead in sin

1151
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,000
 and those who are dead to sin.

1152
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,920
 There are only those two kinds of people.

1153
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,840
 And you might be, well,

1154
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,360
 how do I get from one side to the other?

1155
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,600
 I am still dead in sin, but I want to be dead to sin.

1156
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
 How do I do that?

1157
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,640
 There's only one way.

1158
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,320
 Jesus.

1159
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,080
 Jesus is the only one who can apply

1160
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,160
 that atonement onto you.

1161
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,920
 He was the only one who was perfect,

1162
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,880
 that was sacrificed so that all your debt would be paid.

1163
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,320
 When you truly understand that,

1164
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,760
 then you will have no pride.

1165
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,480
 And this week is the perfect week to reflect on this.

1166
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,760
 The cross.

1167
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,480
 The cross is the only way you can turn

1168
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,680
 from this kind of people to this kind of people.

1169
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,880
 And the cross is the only way

1170
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,400
 that's gonna help you go across there.

1171
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,640
 He is the way, the truth, and the life.

1172
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,320
 All you need to do is humble yourself before him

1173
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,080
 and say, "God, I need to be saved."

1174
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,240
 I'll finish with this quote here.

1175
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,120
 "Every time we look at the cross,

1176
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,120
 "Christ seems to say to us,

1177
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,800
 "I am here because of you.

1178
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,840
 "It is your sin I am bearing.

1179
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,800
 "Your curse I am suffering.

1180
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,420
 "Your debt I am paying.

1181
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,940
 "Your death I am dying."

1182
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,180
 Nothing in history or in the universe

1183
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,180
 cuts you down to size like the cross.

1184
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,000
 All of us have inflated views of ourselves,

1185
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,620
 especially in self-righteousness,

1186
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,220
 until we have visited a place called Calvary.

1187
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,380
 It is there, at the foot of the cross,

1188
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,540
 that we shrink to our true size.

1189
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,980
 Brothers and sisters, this week, there is no better week.

1190
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:02,280
 Would you find yourself at the place called Calvary?

1191
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,420
 Would you allow the cross, the message of the cross,

1192
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,860
 to speak into your life, to shrink you to your true size,

1193
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,380
 so that you can truly understand

1194
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,060
 your deep need for a savior,

1195
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,460
 and that there is hope, that you can be dead to sin.

1196
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,980
 You don't have to remain to be dead in sin.

1197
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,320
 You just need to say, "Be merciful to me, God.

1198
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,540
 "I am a sinner, and I need you."

1199
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,280
 And when that moment comes, you receive that grace.

1200
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,380
 It doesn't matter how many times you fail.

1201
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,480
 His grace will remain.

1202
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,980
 And that is the art, the true art, of losing yourself.

1203
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,540
 So your worship and your prayer won't be about you anymore.

1204
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,720
 It'll be completely about him.

1205
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,120
 My prayer for all of us is,

1206
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:56,140
 would we allow him to really clean us from the inside out,

1207
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,660
 and that we would stop thinking just from the outside in?

1208
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,700
 That we would allow his Holy Spirit to be in us,

1209
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,140
 and allow us to be made right in him.

1210
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,200
 Righteousness of God.

1211
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,740
 Would you join me in prayer as we respond?

1212
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:25,300
 Jesus, we know that in truth,

1213
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,060
 there are many kinds of people in this world,

1214
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,220
 there are not just two.

1215
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,220
 And we are all types of sinners, but sinners we are.

1216
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:45,500
 Thank you, Lord, that you did apply atonement to our sins,

1217
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,000
 that you did become a sinner,

1218
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,300
 so that we would be the righteousness of God,

1219
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,860
 that we would be made right in God's eyes,

1220
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,220
 that we would be justified.

1221
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,580
 Jesus, we know that you are the answer to our sin.

1222
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,180
 We know what your cross can provide for us.

1223
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,700
 So we humble ourselves before you,

1224
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,380
 just like the way you did.

1225
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,260
 You, Lord, who, though it was in the form of God,

1226
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,820
 did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,

1227
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,780
 but you emptied yourself,

1228
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,420
 taking the form of a servant being born

1229
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,760
 in the likeness of men.

1230
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,700
 And being found in human form,

1231
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,540
 you humbled yourself by becoming obedient

1232
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,420
 to the point of death, even death on the cross.

1233
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,140
 Lord, you humbled yourself for us.

1234
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,340
 And therefore God has highly exalted you

1235
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,220
 and bestowed upon you the name that is above every name,

1236
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,300
 so that at your name, every knee will bow

1237
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,900
 and every tongue will confess that you are Lord.

1238
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,620
 You were humbled and now you are exalted,

1239
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,220
 and we follow your lead.

1240
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,060
 Save us, Lord.

1241
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:52,440
 Wash us, clean us from the inside out.

1242
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,060
 Lord, we want to lose ourselves in wonder and awe of you.

1243
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,700
 And every time we fail, we recognize that you,

1244
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,560
 your grace remains for us.

1245
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:12,900
 Lord, we concern ourselves less with behavior modification.

1246
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,700
 We concern ourselves more with heart transformation.

1247
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,920
 We lay down our pride, our self-righteousness.

1248
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,860
 We declare, once again, we do not trust in ourselves,

1249
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,180
 but we trust in you.

1250
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,780
 In your name we pray.

1251
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,360
 (upbeat music)
