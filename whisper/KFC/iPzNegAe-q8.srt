1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 - Thanks, Pastor John.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,200
 Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,000
 Yeah, again, my name is Gabe,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,360
 and I've been part of KFCI for the last two years,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,920
 and very excited to dig into God's word with you all tonight.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,740
 Thanks again to Pastor John for giving me the opportunity

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,200
 and for inviting me to preach today.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,120
 So the past few weeks,

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,840
 we've been going through the book of 1 Peter,

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,600
 and in particular, we've been looking at the theme of hope.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,100
 1 Peter is a letter written by the apostle Peter

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,800
 to Christians who have been exiled, scattered,

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,440
 uprooted from their homes

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,120
 because of the fact that they were Christians,

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,280
 they were being persecuted.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,000
 He's writing to a people who are probably confused

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,360
 and discouraged by the persecution

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,600
 and suffering that they were facing.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,260
 And he writes to them to remind them of the hope

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,800
 that they have in Christ, to take heart, to trust God,

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,720
 and to press on through their suffering.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,400
 In chapter one, we saw that we have been born again

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,460
 to a living hope through the resurrection

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,040
 of Jesus Christ from the dead.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,240
 And James asked us the question, how hopeful are you?

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,840
 In chapter two, Pastor John, he preached

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,920
 that we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
 a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,440
 and that we should live according to our calling.

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,680
 And Michelle reminded me last week from chapter three

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,800
 to follow Christ's example to bless others.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,440
 Do not repay evil for evil, but on the contrary,

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,320
 bless that you may obtain a blessing.

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,240
 And now today in chapter four,

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,440
 we will be answering this question.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,720
 That is, what is the attitude of people living in hope?

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
 What attitude drives the lives of people with hope?

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,080
 What attitude molds our lives?

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,420
 Now there's a lot in this chapter,

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,680
 so we'll only be able to scratch the surface

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
 of the riches of God's words today.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,760
 Peter gives many commands in this chapter

43
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
 and we can't touch on all of them,

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
 but he also gives us the motivation behind those commands.

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
 And my hope today is that we'll be able to see

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,080
 the big picture for the reason why Peter commands us

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,520
 the way he does in light of the hope that we have.

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,240
 So let's get into it.

49
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,800
 This is 1 Peter chapter four.

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,360
 Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh,

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,900
 arm yourselves with the same way of thinking.

52
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,900
 For whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.

53
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,280
 So as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh,

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,600
 no longer for human passions, before the will of God.

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,620
 For the time that is past suffices for doing

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,280
 what the Gentiles want to do.

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,520
 Living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness,

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,700
 orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.

59
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,000
 With respect to this, they are surprised

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,640
 when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,340
 and they malign you.

62
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,040
 But they will give an account to him

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,720
 who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,960
 For this is why the gospel was preached

65
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,480
 even to those who are dead.

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,760
 That though judged in the flesh the way people are,

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,520
 they might live in the spirit the way God does.

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,600
 The end of all things is at hand.

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,840
 Therefore, be self-controlled and sober minded

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,640
 for the sake of your prayers.

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,160
 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly,

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,840
 since love covers a multitude of sins.

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,640
 Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.

74
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,920
 As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,760
 as good stewards of God's varied grace.

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,880
 Whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles of God,

77
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,680
 whoever serves as one who serves

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,640
 by the strength that God supplies,

79
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,040
 in order that in everything,

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
 God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,240
 To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

82
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,680
 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial

83
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,560
 when it comes upon you to test you,

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,960
 as though something strange were happening to you.

85
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,640
 But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings,

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,080
 that you may also rejoice and be glad

87
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,920
 when his glory is revealed.

88
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,960
 If you are insulted for the name of Christ,

89
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,200
 you are blessed because the spirit of glory

90
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,880
 and of God rests upon you.

91
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,040
 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief

92
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,360
 or evildoer or meddler.

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,840
 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian,

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
 let him not be ashamed,

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,760
 but let him glorify God in that name.

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,440
 For it is time for judgment to begin

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,920
 at the household of God.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,240
 And if it begins with us,

99
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,440
 what will be the outcome of those

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,840
 who do not obey the gospel of God?

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,160
 And if the righteous is scarcely saved,

102
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,400
 what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?

103
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,440
 Therefore, let those who suffer according to God's will

104
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,400
 entrust their souls to a faithful creator while doing good.

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
 This is God's word.

106
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,240
 Now, the first thing Peter calls us to do

107
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,560
 that we'll look in today is to fight sin by following Christ.

108
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,440
 To fight sin by following Christ.

109
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,760
 The context here is that there are Christians

110
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,560
 who are suffering persecution as a result of avoiding sin.

111
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,240
 We see this in verse three.

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
 For the time that has passed suffices

113
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,560
 for doing what the Gentiles want to do,

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,760
 living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness,

115
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,640
 orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries.

116
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,600
 By Gentiles here,

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,400
 Peter is referring to unbelievers who do not fear God.

118
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,720
 The situation is that the world around these Christians

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,080
 is completely corrupt and they're indulging

120
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,840
 in all of these sinful passions.

121
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,400
 And then in verse four, with respect to this,

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,560
 they are surprised when you do not join them

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,280
 in the same flood of debauchery and they malign you.

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
 Sin is so ingrained in the culture that it is strange

125
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,120
 when these Christians, when we do not participate.

126
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,320
 And more than that, the world maligns, slanders,

127
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,040
 mocks these Christians, they persecute them

128
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,960
 because they choose not to indulge

129
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
 in the sin that the world wants.

130
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,560
 And so the Christians here are suffering

131
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,480
 because of their desire to fight sin

132
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,880
 and to do the will of God instead of the will of the world.

133
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,160
 And our situation might not be too different.

134
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,440
 2000 years later, we live in the same corrupt world.

135
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,240
 Maybe to your coworkers, one drink isn't enough.

136
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,640
 They want you to get completely blackout drunk

137
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,960
 in their drinking parties.

138
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,040
 It could be the same temptations to sex,

139
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,760
 sensuality, passions, orgies,

140
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,400
 or maybe you're pressured to worship idols from your family

141
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,320
 or to pray to ancestors in lawless idolatry.

142
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,080
 We may be facing similar situations today.

143
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,920
 Peter's encouraging the church to remain strong

144
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,960
 in fighting sin despite persecution,

145
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,320
 despite what suffering might come.

146
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,120
 Verses one and two,

147
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,480
 for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin

148
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,200
 so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh,

149
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,360
 no longer for human passions, before the will of God.

150
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
 Here, whoever has suffered in the flesh

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
 refers to the suffering Christian,

152
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
 to Christians who suffer as a result

153
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,600
 of avoiding sin in this way.

154
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,720
 Peter is saying that when we suffer

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,000
 in a fight against sin,

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,360
 we demonstrate that we have ceased from sin.

157
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,640
 He's not saying that Christians no longer sin,

158
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,440
 but we have ceased from sin in the sense

159
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,240
 that we are no longer slaves to sin.

160
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,400
 We have truly decided to follow the will of God

161
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,160
 from the heart rather than to follow human passions.

162
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,040
 In that way, we have ceased from sin.

163
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,320
 And though we may fail at times in our pursuit for holiness,

164
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,000
 when we suffer in a fight against sin,

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,720
 we've proved that we have been born again.

166
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,400
 We proved our faith is genuine

167
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
 and that we are God's people.

168
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,800
 And Peter calls us to fight sin,

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,640
 pointing to Christ as our example.

170
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,200
 Verse one, "Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh,

171
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,040
 arm yourselves the same way of thinking."

172
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,720
 And NIV translates this as arm yourselves

173
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,560
 with the same attitude, the same attitude as Christ.

174
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,400
 This is the grounds for what Peter

175
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,080
 is encouraging us to do here.

176
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,480
 Peter is calling us to suffer with the same attitude

177
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,320
 that Christ had when he suffered.

178
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
 Now, what's this attitude?

179
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,280
 There's much we could talk about,

180
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,640
 but one thing to note here is that Jesus endured suffering

181
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,240
 by trusting in God and specifically trusting

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,080
 in God's justice.

183
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,560
 Earlier in chapter two, verse 23, it says,

184
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,800
 "Jesus committed no sin,

185
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,320
 neither was deceit found in his mouth.

186
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,720
 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.

187
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,880
 When he suffered, he did not threaten,

188
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,040
 but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly."

189
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,880
 Now in this letter, Peter has been hammering home the point

190
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,560
 that we have hope because of Christ's suffering.

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,880
 Through his death and resurrection,

192
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,080
 we have been born again to this living hope.

193
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,520
 And he calls us to persevere in the face of unjust suffering

194
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,800
 through the same attitude that Christ had

195
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,360
 when he was also slandered and unjustly treated for our sake.

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
 See, Jesus never sinned,

197
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
 but Jesus was falsely accused of blasphemy

198
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,760
 and treated as a criminal.

199
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,600
 He was beaten and mocked because of his obedience to God.

200
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,240
 He suffered unjustly because of that.

201
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,720
 And in the same way, we also might face suffering

202
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,880
 because of our obedience to God.

203
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,560
 Jesus was tempted to disobey God's will,

204
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,680
 God's plan for our salvation.

205
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,920
 He could have called angels to rescue him from the cross,

206
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,000
 but instead he chose to obey God perfectly.

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,120
 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,560
 that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.

209
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,520
 And in his suffering, Jesus trusted God.

210
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,600
 He trusted that God would judge justly

211
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,920
 and raise him from the dead, vindicate him.

212
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,840
 And he also trusted that his death

213
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,440
 would be sufficient to save us,

214
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,280
 that God would judge us justly

215
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,480
 according to his righteousness.

216
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,200
 And that is the hope that drove him to obey God.

217
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,520
 Jesus trusted in him.

218
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,600
 And here we're called to trust God in the same way,

219
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 verses four and five.

220
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
 They malign you, but they will give an account to him

221
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,840
 who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

222
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
 Here, Peter points us to God's justice

223
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,720
 as encouragement to persevere in suffering.

224
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
 Peter says, "God will bring justice.

225
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,480
 He will judge the living and the dead.

226
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,020
 We may see evil go unpunished in this life.

227
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,120
 Bad people may prosper and live without justice

228
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,760
 ever being served to them,

229
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
 but God will judge the living and dead.

230
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,560
 You cannot escape God's judgment, even in death,

231
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,120
 or rather I might say more accurately, especially in death.

232
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,900
 Those who do not obey God,

233
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,360
 those who have not been raised to new life in Christ

234
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,080
 will face condemnation.

235
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,320
 But we have hope from verse six.

236
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,960
 For this is why the gospel is preached

237
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
 even to those who are dead,

238
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,120
 that though judged in the flesh the way people are,

239
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
 they might live in the spirit the way God does.

240
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
 You see, Christ died that we might have new life

241
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,560
 and the gospel is preached so that we could have this life.

242
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,940
 It is through the preaching of the gospel

243
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,560
 that we can know Christ and have faith in Christ.

244
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,400
 And all who believe in him will be judged as righteous

245
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,380
 by the one who judges justly.

246
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,340
 That's the good news of the gospel.

247
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,520
 And so like Christ, then we can trust God in suffering

248
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,620
 and in our fight against sin.

249
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,180
 We can trust that God hates sin and that sin leads to death.

250
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,120
 And then we can run from the flood of debauchery

251
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
 that the world tempts us to,

252
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
 knowing that it is a straight line to death.

253
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,100
 And we can also flee from sin with hope,

254
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,120
 knowing that God is just and through faith in Christ,

255
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,240
 he will count us as righteous.

256
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,080
 And though we may be mocked for it,

257
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,920
 people might say, why does God care

258
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
 what two adults do with each other?

259
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
 And though we may be mocked,

260
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,360
 we can fight for holiness with faith,

261
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,160
 knowing that we are bound for eternal glory

262
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
 because of Christ.

263
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,640
 So people with hope fights sin by following Christ.

264
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,040
 We fight sin by following Christ.

265
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,480
 Question for all of you guys, you can type in the chat.

266
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,340
 What would you do if today were your last day to live?

267
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,640
 Or it's actually kind of late in the evening.

268
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,660
 So what would you do if maybe you had one more day to live?

269
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,200
 If tomorrow were your last day to live, what would you do?

270
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,960
 (pages rustling)

271
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:35,360
 What would you do if it were your last day to live?

272
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,640
 Anthony says, have a feast with friends and family.

273
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,720
 Also John, gather family, spend it with family.

274
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
 That's good.

275
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,960
 Vincent makes good steak, I heard.

276
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,720
 (pages rustling)

277
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,560
 Yeah, so those are all good things.

278
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,040
 Lots of spending time with family.

279
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,460
 Good, yeah.

280
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,480
 So Peter also has something to say

281
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,440
 about what we should do in light of this.

282
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,720
 Here, Peter reminds us that the end is near.

283
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,960
 And in light of this, he tells us to stay alert

284
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,860
 and to love and serve one another.

285
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,320
 This is what Peter calls us to do

286
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
 in light of the fact that the end is near.

287
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
 You see in verse seven, the end of all things is at hand.

288
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,840
 Therefore be self-controlled and sober minded

289
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,400
 for the sake of your prayers.

290
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,040
 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly

291
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,960
 since love covers a multitude of sins.

292
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,960
 Show hospitality with one another without grumbling.

293
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,440
 As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another

294
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,940
 as good stewards of God's various grace.

295
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,360
 So here, Peter says the end of all things is at hand.

296
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,520
 And sometimes the end times in our minds

297
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,200
 are associated with crazy apocalyptic events

298
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
 like you might hear in Revelation.

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,040
 War, famine, pestilence, crazy stuff, things blowing up.

300
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,760
 The end times are not just restricted to that.

301
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,800
 The New Testament authors, the Bible refers to us right now

302
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
 as living in the end times.

303
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,720
 Jesus brought about the last days

304
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,440
 through his life, death, and resurrection.

305
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,480
 And this doesn't mean the world

306
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,180
 will necessarily end tomorrow.

307
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,540
 But Jesus did say that he will return soon

308
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,500
 and he will come like a thief in the night,

309
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,340
 suddenly a time that we can't predict or expect.

310
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,820
 And so naturally we should say

311
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,060
 sober minded and self-controlled,

312
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,020
 which you might note is the opposite

313
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,940
 of the world's flood of debauchery

314
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,380
 that they would have us join.

315
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,380
 And it's a bit remarkable to me

316
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,780
 how really unremarkable Peter's commands are

317
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,620
 despite the end being near.

318
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,900
 He doesn't say go live your best life now,

319
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,840
 have fun, let's go out with a bang,

320
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
 we're going to Vegas.

321
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,120
 No, what does he say?

322
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,280
 He says, people of hope, the end is near.

323
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,740
 Stay focused, stay alert so that you can pray.

324
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,980
 The end is near, therefore love one another.

325
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,500
 The end is near, therefore show hospitality

326
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 without grumbling.

327
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,020
 The end is near, serve one another.

328
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,540
 It's interesting to me how commonplace these commands are

329
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,280
 that he's saying in light of this.

330
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,440
 You might ask, why does he even like bring up the fact

331
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,880
 that the end is near here?

332
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,900
 He's commanding us to do these everyday things

333
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,660
 that we're supposed to do all the time.

334
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,360
 We're called to love each other all the time,

335
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,920
 we're called to serve each other all the time.

336
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,040
 And I think that's really kind of the point here.

337
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
 The end of all things is to be expected.

338
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,480
 The fact that the end of all things is at hand

339
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,200
 shouldn't catch us off guard or surprise us.

340
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,280
 As people of hope, we should be living at all time,

341
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,000
 looking forward to the hope of Christ's return.

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,840
 Moving on to verse 10, as each has received a gift,

343
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,700
 use it to serve one another as good stewards

344
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,420
 of God's very grace.

345
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,860
 Whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles of God,

346
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,740
 whoever serves as one who serves

347
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,440
 by the strength that God supplies.

348
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,520
 Peter reminds us here of the grace

349
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,740
 that God has graciously given us.

350
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,860
 He has firstly saved all of us Christians by his grace,

351
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,940
 but also God has given us various gifts.

352
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,580
 We are one body in Christ with many members

353
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,320
 and the members don't all have the same function.

354
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,700
 Think for a bit, what gifts has God given you?

355
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,700
 Maybe you're good at connecting with others, welcoming them,

356
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,060
 or you're good at teaching or at leadership,

357
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,700
 encouraging others.

358
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,100
 Some are generous givers.

359
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,560
 How has God gifted you?

360
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,420
 Whatever the way, whatever his very grace is,

361
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,500
 he has given you grace for a reason.

362
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,520
 That is that we may love and serve one another

363
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,300
 and be good stewards of his grace

364
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,260
 in light of the fact that the end of all things is at hand.

365
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,900
 And also in everything we do,

366
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,740
 we should be relying on God's grace.

367
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,380
 Verse 11 says, whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles

368
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,140
 of God, whoever serves as one who serves

369
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
 by the strength that God supplies.

370
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,340
 We should love and serve one another

371
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,260
 and we should do this, we should do everything

372
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,700
 by relying on God's strength, on his grace.

373
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,740
 And what's the reason that's given for that?

374
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,980
 In verse 11, in order that in everything,

375
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,860
 God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.

376
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,780
 God deserves the glory, right?

377
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,780
 To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

378
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,900
 So we should love and serve by the strength

379
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,320
 that God supplies, by his grace, so that God gets the glory.

380
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
 By glory here, I mean the display

381
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,540
 and recognition of God's worth.

382
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,180
 He deserves to be regarded as holy.

383
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,300
 As we saw earlier, it is God who gave us every good thing.

384
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,980
 He created us, he's the only eternal one

385
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,540
 and he saved us through Christ.

386
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,460
 He brought us out of darkness and into his marvelous light.

387
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,860
 And he equipped us by his grace to do the good works

388
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,940
 that he prepared for us to do.

389
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,980
 And so it's only fitting, it's only right

390
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,620
 that we see reality as it truly is

391
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,060
 and acknowledge him as our creator and sustainer

392
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,180
 because he is the one who has given us this grace.

393
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,140
 How do we glorify God?

394
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,020
 How does what we do as humans

395
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,620
 result in God glorified through Christ?

396
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,100
 One way is we glorify him by relying on him.

397
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,380
 God is not served by human hands as though

398
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,220
 he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind

399
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,180
 life and breath and everything as it says in Acts.

400
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,020
 But rather Isaiah says,

401
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,100
 the Lord waits to be gracious to you

402
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,060
 and therefore he exalts or glorifies himself

403
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,220
 to show mercy to you.

404
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,340
 God is not served by human hands

405
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,820
 and he's not honored when we try to obey him

406
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,980
 by our own strength or when we try to fight sin

407
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,220
 and love others by our own works.

408
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,380
 But God glorifies himself by showing grace and mercy to us.

409
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,940
 God designed everything so that he would get the glory.

410
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,660
 Salvation is by faith in Christ so that no one can boast.

411
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,500
 If we can earn our own righteousness by works,

412
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,460
 the credit or the glory would go to us.

413
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,860
 But we are saved by faith so that God gets the glory

414
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,260
 through Jesus Christ.

415
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,540
 And in the same way, when we continue to live by faith

416
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,020
 and to serve by the strength that God supplies,

417
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,060
 he also gets the glory.

418
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,860
 He gets the praise and glory for saving us

419
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,260
 and for continually working his grace in us.

420
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,420
 And he is also honored and glorified when we rely on him,

421
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,580
 when we have faith in him

422
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,220
 and count him as worthy to be trusted.

423
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,060
 Also, why would we even want to rely on our own strength?

424
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,740
 Remember how we were once slaves to sin?

425
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,540
 Remember all the times that we failed to love others?

426
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,020
 Even now, when we sought our own interests to love

427
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,420
 and serve ourselves rather than to serve others.

428
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,340
 So would we rather rely on our own weak strength

429
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,340
 or by the strength that an all-powerful,

430
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,420
 omnipotent God supplies us in Christ?

431
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,580
 God's strength is better than our strength.

432
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,260
 And so we should love and serve one another

433
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,780
 by relying on God so that God gets the glory

434
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
 and we get the help.

435
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,940
 As John Piper puts it,

436
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,940
 the beauty of the gospel is we get the help

437
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
 and God gets the glory.

438
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,260
 We are freely given grace, God's riches at Christ's expense

439
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,340
 and God gets all of the honor and praise.

440
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,780
 When we trust in God, we get the strength

441
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,340
 and God gets the glory.

442
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,660
 So we should love and serve one another

443
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,300
 by relying on God's strength, by faith.

444
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,020
 Now, the third thing that Peter calls us to do

445
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,180
 is to endure suffering,

446
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,460
 to endure suffering through joyful faith,

447
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,180
 endure suffering through joyful faith.

448
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,620
 Verse 12 says, "Beloved, do not be surprised

449
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,780
 "at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you

450
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,780
 "as if something strange were happening to you."

451
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,140
 Let's stop here and first note that suffering

452
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,020
 should not take us by surprise, right?

453
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,900
 We should not be surprised at the fiery trial

454
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,740
 when it comes upon us to test us.

455
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,540
 It's not strange.

456
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,340
 And one reason that's given for why suffering is expected

457
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,660
 is because Christ also suffered, as we saw earlier.

458
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,820
 Christ suffered because of his obedience to God.

459
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,300
 And we will share in Christ's suffering as well

460
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,260
 when we live in obedience to God.

461
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,100
 If Christ had to suffer, we should also expect to suffer.

462
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,220
 Second Timothy says, "Indeed, all who desire

463
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,100
 "to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."

464
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,700
 And Jesus said in John 15,

465
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,880
 "A servant is not greater than his master.

466
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,420
 "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you."

467
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,700
 We should expect suffering.

468
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,180
 It shouldn't take us by surprise.

469
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,940
 God never promised us ease and comfort in this life.

470
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,820
 He never promised us wealth and health in this age.

471
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,580
 Rather, he promises that we will be hated for his namesake

472
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,260
 and maybe to briefly digress,

473
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,340
 if we're fitting in perfectly with the world,

474
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,220
 if we're not really ruffling any feathers, so to speak.

475
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,260
 Maybe we should reflect a little on why that really is.

476
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,300
 But anyways, God doesn't promise that life will be easy.

477
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,260
 But what he does promise to us,

478
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,020
 even though it might be difficult,

479
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,740
 is that all our suffering,

480
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,380
 all the trials of this life will be worth it.

481
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,500
 Verse 13 says, "Rejoice insofar

482
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,180
 "as you share Christ's sufferings,

483
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,740
 "that you may also rejoice and be glad

484
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,380
 "when his glory is revealed."

485
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,020
 We may rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.

486
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,220
 So why should we rejoice in suffering?

487
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,260
 We should rejoice knowing that our suffering has a purpose.

488
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,900
 Notice it says, "We are to rejoice in suffering,

489
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,700
 "so that with the purpose and result that

490
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,840
 "we can also rejoice in Christ's glory

491
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,460
 "as revealed at his second coming."

492
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,900
 We can rejoice in suffering because we trust

493
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
 that our suffering has a purpose.

494
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,420
 God is testing our faith.

495
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,540
 He is refining us through trials.

496
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,380
 This points back to chapter one.

497
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
 "We rejoice in our living hope,

498
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,820
 "though now for a little while, if necessary,

499
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,320
 "you have been grieved by various trials,

500
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,300
 "so that the tested genuineness of your faith,

501
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,060
 "more precious than gold that perishes,

502
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
 "though it is tested by fire,

503
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,620
 "may be found to result in praise and glory and honor

504
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,460
 "at the revelation of Jesus Christ."

505
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,700
 So we can rejoice in suffering

506
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,160
 because we can hold fast to the hope that we have.

507
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,900
 When we consider Christ more precious

508
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,680
 than anything the world has to offer,

509
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,020
 when we're looking forward to this reward,

510
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
 this eternal joy that awaits us,

511
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,180
 then we can rejoice in suffering,

512
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,020
 knowing that God is preparing that for us through our trials

513
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,660
 and even with tears in our eyes,

514
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,540
 whatever trials or sufferings that come our way,

515
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
 we can rejoice.

516
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,080
 We can rejoice because our souls are full

517
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,820
 because of the eternal glory that awaits us

518
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,220
 on the day of Christ,

519
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,300
 even if it hurts right now,

520
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,400
 even if there's pain right now.

521
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,420
 More than that, we can also count ourselves blessed.

522
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,700
 Verse 14, "If you're insulted for the name of Christ,

523
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,220
 "you are blessed because the spirit of glory

524
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,700
 "and of God rests upon you."

525
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,500
 We are blessed for one, because our faith,

526
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,460
 our perseverance in suffering is a mark

527
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,460
 that we are God's people,

528
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,220
 that we will inherit the hope that awaits us.

529
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,820
 Also, we are blessed now in the present

530
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,240
 because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon us.

531
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,340
 We are blessed because God is with us

532
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,260
 even now in our suffering.

533
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,380
 He didn't leave us out to dry.

534
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,660
 Christ didn't just go to heaven,

535
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,980
 but he also, he did return to heaven,

536
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,460
 but he also sent a helper who is with us,

537
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,080
 the spirit who empowers us.

538
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,900
 He's watching over us, disciplining us for good,

539
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,220
 and he empowers us by his spirit

540
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,620
 to persevere by the strength that he supplies

541
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,980
 so that God gets the glory.

542
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,260
 So people with hope endure suffering through joyful hope.

543
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,260
 We have joy because we hold onto our hope

544
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,900
 when we look to the reward

545
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,820
 that we will live for the rest of time

546
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,620
 in the presence of God with no more pain,

547
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,660
 no more suffering,

548
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,180
 where he will wipe every tear from our eyes,

549
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,740
 where we will be his people and he will be our God.

550
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,020
 When we have that hope, we can rejoice

551
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,340
 because we are blessed, because God's spirit is with us.

552
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,740
 And so Peter sums all this up in verse 19.

553
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,540
 It says, "Therefore, let those who suffer

554
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,300
 "according to God's will and trust their souls

555
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,900
 "to a faithful creator while doing good."

556
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,900
 So let us endure suffering, trusting in God while doing good.

557
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,500
 That's what people with hope do.

558
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,300
 People with hope endure suffering through joyful hope

559
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,000
 while trusting God and doing good.

560
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,060
 We endure suffering through joyful hope.

561
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,300
 So again, today we set out to answer the question,

562
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,180
 what attitude drives the life of a people with hope?

563
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,360
 We saw that Peter commanded a few actions.

564
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,340
 We're to fight sin, love and serve one another,

565
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,600
 endure suffering.

566
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 And behind the commands, he gives some attitudes,

567
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,080
 some motivations behind them.

568
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,320
 We should follow Christ, follow Christ's example.

569
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,920
 We should rely on God's grace,

570
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,480
 looking forward to the future

571
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,480
 and endure through our joyful hope.

572
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,180
 Those are the attitudes that people with hope live by.

573
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,600
 And actually, everything that we've looked at today

574
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,560
 can be summed up in one word, and that is faith.

575
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,760
 Everything that we've seen today can be distilled in this.

576
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,460
 People with hope live by faith.

577
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,720
 See, we live by faith

578
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,200
 when we follow Christ's example in suffering.

579
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,360
 Jesus obeyed God with faith that God would judge justly

580
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,800
 and that God's will, that God's plan was good

581
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,160
 and that it would be worth the pain.

582
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,800
 We live by faith when we rely on God's grace

583
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,720
 and live by the strength that he supplies.

584
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
 We serve and love one another

585
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,480
 by the strength that God supplies.

586
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,120
 And we live by faith when we endure suffering

587
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,080
 with hope, with this joyful faith

588
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,840
 that God has prepared an inheritance for us

589
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,140
 that is imperishable, undefiled and unfading.

590
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,960
 We live by faith with our eyes fixed on the reward,

591
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,360
 persevering for the joy that is set before us.

592
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,400
 People with hope live by faith.

593
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,160
 That's the attitude of a people with faith.

594
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,600
 It should be clear from this chapter,

595
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,360
 from what we've seen so far,

596
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,080
 that Peter calls us to persevere by faith.

597
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,440
 Also, the statement in itself should be kind of obvious,

598
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,240
 that people with hope live by faith.

599
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,360
 You see, faith is having confidence in hope.

600
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,840
 Hebrews 11 says,

601
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,600
 "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for,

602
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,920
 the conviction of things not seen."

603
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,840
 Faith and hope are not the same thing,

604
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,200
 but they are very closely related.

605
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,300
 Faith is the assurance of hope.

606
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,600
 So all we're really saying here,

607
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,640
 by people with hope live by faith,

608
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,680
 is that people with hope will live by

609
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,700
 that same joyful, soul-satisfying assurance

610
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,360
 of their hope in Christ.

611
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,140
 And that's what we call faith.

612
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,560
 People who are confident of their hope

613
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,700
 live by that same assurance of their hope.

614
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,260
 This is pretty straightforward stuff

615
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,880
 that people with hope live by hope.

616
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,600
 It's not really a groundbreaking discovery.

617
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,520
 It's kind of like singing, singers sing.

618
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,200
 That's what singers do, they sing.

619
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,080
 Or dancers dance.

620
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,000
 This isn't like 200 IQ stuff.

621
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Like even the great philosopher Taylor Swift once said,

622
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,800
 "The player is gonna play, play, play, play, play.

623
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,220
 And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."

624
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,880
 And in the same way, people with faith live by faith.

625
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,160
 Hopers gonna hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.

626
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,160
 It's pretty simple, right?

627
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,960
 God's people who have been saved by faith

628
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,480
 live by that same faith.

629
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,840
 As it's written, "The righteous shall live by faith."

630
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
 People with faith live by faith.

631
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,440
 And the question for us all today is,

632
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,600
 are we living by faith?

633
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,720
 Do we live by faith?

634
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,760
 And by that, I don't just mean,

635
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,340
 have you believed that Jesus has died for the cross?

636
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,920
 That is an essential part of a faith.

637
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,560
 But faith doesn't just stop there looking back, right?

638
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,840
 The faith that Jesus, that Peter describes,

639
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,200
 isn't stuck with its head in the past.

640
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,800
 It believes that God is at work both here and now

641
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,680
 and in the future, just as he was in the past

642
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,440
 when Christ died on the cross.

643
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,520
 Peter calls us to look forward

644
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,200
 to God's final judgment in our fight against sin.

645
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,800
 He directs us to look forward to the end of all things

646
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,000
 in our love and service.

647
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
 And he points us to the hope of Christ's return

648
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,520
 as we endure in suffering.

649
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,160
 And the hope that Peter presents us

650
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,100
 is that God will continue to do good to us in the future.

651
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,600
 See, true faith believes in the cross,

652
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,720
 but not just as a historical fact.

653
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,000
 Faith believes that Christ has bought for us on the cross

654
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,300
 all of God's promises and all of God's blessings,

655
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,720
 that they all find their yes in Christ.

656
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,920
 True faith believes that the cross guarantees

657
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,040
 that God will always be good to us

658
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,920
 both now and for the rest of eternity.

659
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,800
 And if you have this kind of faith,

660
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,480
 it will necessarily change your life.

661
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,000
 You can't have true faith and be unchanged, right?

662
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,120
 If you truly believe that sin brings death,

663
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,840
 but God's will is life, then we will fight sin.

664
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,640
 When we find Christ more precious

665
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
 than all the riches of this world,

666
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,160
 than anything this world has to offer,

667
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,140
 when we truly believe that this light momentary affliction

668
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,500
 is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory

669
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,440
 beyond all comparison,

670
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,140
 we won't even be able to stop our souls from rejoicing.

671
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,100
 If we lose sight of that hope,

672
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,820
 if we try to obey God by our own strength

673
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,200
 rather than the strength that he supplies,

674
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,060
 that's how we will be discouraged.

675
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,220
 We'll be shaken and discouraged

676
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,980
 whenever we face any kind of trials

677
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,600
 because we're working on our own strength.

678
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,700
 And that's why Peter calls us to set our hope fully,

679
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,940
 our hope completely on the grace that will be brought to us

680
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,200
 at the revelation of Jesus Christ,

681
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,900
 so that we would live every day by faith,

682
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
 by the strength that God supplies.

683
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,580
 So are we living by faith?

684
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,380
 And if you can answer yes to that question, honestly,

685
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,240
 if the spirit is truly filling your hearts

686
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,060
 with hope and joy, then praise God.

687
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,180
 That is truly a work of God.

688
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,500
 That is his grace in you.

689
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,460
 And if that's the case,

690
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,060
 I encourage you brothers and sisters to press on in faith

691
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,180
 with the joy that's set before you.

692
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,620
 But if you're here feeling discouraged,

693
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,140
 thinking falling God really is tough.

694
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,640
 Christian life is exhausting.

695
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,140
 I don't know if I can do it.

696
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,660
 God's commands feel like a huge burden on me, a huge weight.

697
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,040
 If that's the case, then fix your eyes on Christ

698
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
 and he will give you rest.

699
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,580
 God's demands will seem heavy

700
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,860
 if you try to obey on your own strength.

701
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,620
 But when you trust God and when you love him,

702
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,420
 then his words will be sweeter than honey

703
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,380
 and more precious than gold.

704
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,940
 If you live by faith,

705
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,180
 then we will understand what Jesus meant when he said,

706
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,260
 "His yoke is easy and his burden is light."

707
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,380
 Seek him with all your heart today.

708
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,740
 God is waiting to be gracious to you

709
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,540
 and he exalts himself to show mercy to you.

710
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,820
 So are we living by faith?

711
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,280
 Does the hope of Christ guide our thoughts

712
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,540
 and mold every inch of our life?

713
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,020
 Does it compel us to obedience to good works,

714
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:30,020
 to boldness, for greater love and service to each other?

715
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,320
 Do you have that faith?

716
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,820
 I'll close by reminding us again

717
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,480
 of our hope from chapter one.

718
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,180
 On us all to reflect on this.

719
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,340
 Does this hope fill our hearts with inexpressible joy?

720
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,380
 Does it stir us to live boldly in obedience to God?

721
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,820
 I pray that this all will be an encouragement to us,

722
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,980
 that this hope, this reminder of this hope

723
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,200
 will spur us on to live by faith.

724
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,220
 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

725
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,940
 According to his great mercy,

726
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,060
 he has caused us to be born again to a living hope

727
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,220
 through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

728
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,700
 to an inheritance that is imperishable,

729
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,940
 undefiled and unfading,

730
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,420
 kept in heaven for you,

731
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,980
 who by God's power are being guarded through faith

732
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,220
 for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

733
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,260
 In this you rejoice, though not now for a little while,

734
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,500
 if necessary, you've been grieved by various trials,

735
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,140
 so that the tested genuineness of your faith,

736
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,320
 more precious than gold that perishes,

737
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,400
 though it is tested by fire,

738
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,200
 would be found to result in praise and glory and honor

739
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,480
 at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

740
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,360
 Though you have not seen him, you love him.

741
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,160
 Though you do not now see him, you believe in him

742
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,680
 and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible

743
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
 and filled with glory,

744
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,280
 obtaining the outcome of your faith,

745
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,320
 the salvation of your souls.

746
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,500
 This is the true great grace of God.

747
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,800
 Let us stand for a minute.

748
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,620
 Let's pray.

749
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,560
 Father, we thank you that we have this hope

750
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,200
 that you have blessed us in Christ.

751
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,220
 Lord, we believe in you.

752
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,920
 Help our unbelief.

753
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,700
 Help us to fix our eyes firmly on the hope

754
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,860
 that is set before us in Christ.

755
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,580
 Lord, we are weak, but you are strong.

756
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,340
 Lord, you have saved us in Christ.

757
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,060
 You empower us by your spirit.

758
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,620
 We pray that you would have us follow Christ

759
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,560
 in his suffering, that we would endure by faith.

760
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,740
 Lord, we can't do this on our own,

761
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,940
 but we trust you that you are good,

762
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,820
 that in Christ, all the promises of God find their yes.

763
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,220
 So Lord, we pray this with confidence

764
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,060
 in the cross of Christ.

765
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,900
 Amen.
