1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Thank you.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And hi, Bonnie.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Thank you very much for that reading.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And please excuse me, I'm getting used to new technology here, which doesn't seem to be working very well.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I seem to have black eyes at the moment.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 But we'll move around.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 As you may have gathered from Bonnie's reading, tonight I will examine Jesus' statement, "I am the door."

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 More often than not, people are entryways to a new direction and a quality of life.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 In a way, they are doors in the next stage of your journey.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 One of those in my own life was our own senior pastor, Pastor Peter.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I met Pastor Peter on a number of occasions over a number of years.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 And then one day, it was the 10th of May, 2016, he invited me for breakfast.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We went to the Four Seasons restaurant, the Japanese restaurant in the building, the Far East Finance Center.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I was sort of semi-retired at the time.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I was working on my doctorate and a number of other projects.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Pastor Peter told me over bacon and coffee that KFC were considering starting an English service at some time in the near future,

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 as a means of retaining the church's youth and young people.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I remember saying something to Pastor Peter like this, "Pastor Peter, it's not about language.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It's about culture."

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And to cut a long story short, Pastor Peter asked me to explain what I meant,

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 firstly to him, then to the deacons, and then with Sandra, to a wider pastoral team.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Then one day, Hank took me out for a coffee.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I remember it was Pacific coffee in the Vine Center.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And Hank said to me these words, "We want to hire you."

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yeah, I was flabbergasted.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 When I recovered, I gave him at least half a dozen reasons why this wasn't a good idea.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But somehow he pretended he was deaf to them all.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And a door was opened for me to become part of God's work, what God was doing at this church.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And almost six years later, God is still opening doors.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 It leads me to some questions.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Have you ever had experience with someone who invited you, as Pastor Peter and the team did to me,

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 into a new season of life and opportunity?

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 It could have been a teacher who invited you into a special project at school.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 It could have been a parent, a relative, a friend who gave you that musical instrument

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 and encouraged you to take music lessons.

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 It could have been a coach who saw something in you and invited you into a team or a program to see you grow as an athlete.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Or perhaps it was a supervisor who recommended you for a promotion or a raise.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Perhaps it was the leader who saw something in you and opened up a doorway of opportunity for you to lead.

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 But I just have to say, the doorway isn't necessarily positive.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It might be the person who invited us or introduced us to a toxic relationship.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 They invited us for the first time to take that drug which we became enslaved to.

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 They were an entryway to something that we knew wasn't good for us,

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 but their invitation made it easy and enticing to pass through that doorway.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Or what about the friend who persuaded you that that get-rich-quick scheme was a better way of you becoming financially stable

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 than 40 years of working 9 to 6, or should I say 9 to 9 in Hong Kong, in an office?

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And since then, you have regarded a long-term investment as anything you've had to hold for more than a week.

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 We could come up with dozens of examples of people who saw something in us or removed an obstacle for us to enter into a new season of growth in our lives.

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Effectively, they were a door for us.

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Sandra and I – Sandra's sitting with me here – Sandra and I came to Hong Kong on a three-year contract.

50
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 A three-year contract in 1987.

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 We had reasoned that three years out of a lifetime wasn't very much.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Thirty-five years later and we're still here.

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 But I want to come back to a time in 1990 when our three-year contract was due to expire.

54
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 We had a deep sense, a conviction that we were not to return to the UK.

55
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Indeed, on the 10th of March 1990, at 3.40pm, off Deepwater Bay, a visiting preacher, his name was Dr. R.T. Kendall,

56
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 had seen this in us and prayed while we were on our company junk that God would make a way for us to stay in Hong Kong.

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Fast forward to June and my boss at the time, Terry Jenkins, not a believer, called me in and he said these words,

58
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 "Have you ever thought about staying in Hong Kong?" I nearly fell off my chair.

59
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I admitted I had.

60
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And within 72 hours, I had been appointed as the company's new general manager for marketing.

61
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Another significant door had opened, one that allowed me and my family to stay in Hong Kong.

62
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 If I had time, I could tell you about others, how a door opened for an insurance man to become an international church's first full-time senior pastor.

63
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And just recently, how God opened the door for this one campaign to go firstly citywide and then global.

64
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So we're going to talk a lot about doors today.

65
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 But doors in a very specific context. Jesus is going to set up the conversation for us.

66
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Now, a word of warning. There's going to be a lot of talk about sheep and shepherds, sheep pens and watchmen, etc.

67
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 In Hong Kong, we are not used to having a sheep pen in our apartment blocks or home grounds.

68
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Maybe Paul does in my wall. I don't know.

69
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 But for those of us who don't, let's sit back and let's back up so we know what we are talking about here.

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Let me give you some background. In John, chapter nine, Jesus heals a man born blind.

71
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Remember, that's important. And he's having a conversation about who he is.

72
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And the spiritual blindness of the Pharisees. This miraculous sign is pointing to his own authority as the Messiah that the Old Testament prophecies were pointing to.

73
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 The Old Testament said that Messiah could perform certain certain miracles.

74
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Only the Messiah could perform this. We had an example a few weeks ago with Michelle.

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 She talked about Lazarus, who was raised. He'd been dead for four days.

76
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Healing someone who had been born blind was one such miracle.

77
00:10:44,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And in his next breath, in John, chapter 10, Jesus pivots and brings in another metaphor, an important metaphor, the metaphor of shepherd.

78
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 A very common image in the Old Testament is God as shepherd of the sheep of Israel.

79
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And many Hebrew leaders had seasons as shepherds. Look all the way back to Genesis.

80
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Abel, Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, David, Moses and Jacob pointed to God as Israel's ultimate good shepherd.

81
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So God as shepherd and Israel as sheep was a very well understood metaphor.

82
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 This would have been second nature for the Pharisees to whom Jesus was speaking.

83
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 That brings us to our text for today, which Bonnie read to us in John, chapter 10, 1 to 5.

84
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Jesus sets up the scene.

85
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in another way.

86
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 That man. Is a thief or a robber.

87
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 But he who enters the door. By the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

88
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 To him, the gatekeeper opens.

89
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Sheep hear his voice. And he calls his own sheep by name.

90
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And he leads them out. When he is brought out all his own, he goes before them and the sheep follow him.

91
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 For they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow.

92
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 But they will flee from him. For they do not know the voice of strangers.

93
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees that we met in chapter nine.

94
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And he starts talking about shepherds. And sheep.

95
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 First of all, sheep are vulnerable creatures.

96
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Easily injured. And to be honest, not too bright.

97
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Sheep pen must be entered through a door or entryway.

98
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I'll put a picture here for you.

99
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 What you'll see is there is only one entry into the pen.

100
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Very often the shepherd. Or a hired watchman would literally sleep across the entryway into that sheep pen.

101
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They would physically be the door to that safe place.

102
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Any other entry is illegitimate.

103
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 The gate watchman only allows the true shepherd through the door.

104
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Now, what happens? The flock stay in the sheep pen at night.

105
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 The shepherd goes home and goes to bed.

106
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 While the hired watchman guards the door.

107
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 The pen, which usually backs up to a cliff or some rocks, has one small entryway that the watchman guards.

108
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 The pen walls are about waist high and topped with thickets and thorns to keep predators out.

109
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 If someone was coming into the sheep pen, other than through the doorway, they would have bad intentions.

110
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 This is important. Sheep know their own shepherd.

111
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 They won't follow anyone else.

112
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Now, since the sheep wouldn't follow anyone other than their own shepherd, they are very difficult to get out of the pen.

113
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 So a thief would actually slit the throat of the sheep and toss it over the wall in order to steal it.

114
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Then Jesus introduces the main metaphor for us.

115
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 So Jesus again said to them.

116
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Truly, I say to you. I am the door of the sheep.

117
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

118
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I am the door.

119
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and go in and out and find pasture.

120
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

121
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.

122
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Jesus is really talking about two separate doors.

123
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Jesus is the door that leads to life.

124
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 All other doors lead to death.

125
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 From previous chapters of John, it has been clear that the Pharisees believed that their doorway to life was the letter of the law.

126
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 In other words, their adherence to the Old Testament code they got from Moses was their doorway to life.

127
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Jesus turns this on his head.

128
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 In John, chapter five, Jesus had confronted them, saying this, you search the scriptures because you think in them you may have eternal life.

129
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me.

130
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 That you may have life.

131
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 If they wanted the doorway to life, they needed to pass through Jesus.

132
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Instead, they entered another door and it only brought them condemnation.

133
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 There was no life behind the letter of the law.

134
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 It's not that the law was all bad.

135
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 It is obviously a good thing to know the scriptures.

136
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 It's a good thing to respect the law that Moses handed down.

137
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 But they had taken a good thing and made it into an ultimate thing.

138
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Ultimately missing the point.

139
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It's like they took the door of behavior management and biblical education and they painted a big S for salvation on it.

140
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 But it was mislabeled.

141
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 There's the door for you.

142
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 It was mislabeled.

143
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Passing through that mislabeled door only led to a dead end.

144
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Literally.

145
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And Jesus wanted to save them from it.

146
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 So what is the modern equivalent of that for us?

147
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 What doorways are we painting a big S on expecting that they will offer salvation to us?

148
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 We say, oh, if only I was in a relationship with that person, then I would have the life that I want.

149
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Would we finally be happy?

150
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 If I could only be better looking or more cool, I could be the most popular person in my social circles.

151
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 If only I passed through the doorway of that promotion.

152
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I would have the salvation my heart desires.

153
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 If only I might have just a little bit more money.

154
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Then I would have the life I dreamed of.

155
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 We paint the big S.

156
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Of salvation on doorways that can never deliver.

157
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 No amount of money, fame, status, recognition, material goods I could go on will ever bring the soul salvation.

158
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 The feminist humorist writer Cynthia Hamel wrote in an article in 1990 in the American news and culture paper, The Village Voice, a publication known for being the USA's first alternatively news weekly.

159
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 She had in her younger days been a waitress in an establishment that so many celebrities had frequented.

160
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 She had interacted with them at the height of their careers.

161
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And this was her takeaway.

162
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I pity celebrities. I really do.

163
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Those people were once perfectly pleasant human beings.

164
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 But now their wrath is awful.

165
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I think the way God wants to play a really rotten practical joke on you, he grants you your deepest wish.

166
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And then laughs merrily when you realize you want to kill yourself.

167
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You say they wanted fame.

168
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 They worked, they pushed, and the morning after each one of them became famous, they wanted to take an overdose.

169
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Because that giant thing they were striving for, that fame thing that was going to make everything OK, that was going to make their lives bearable, that was going to provide them with personal fulfillment and happiness.

170
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And happened. And they were still them.

171
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 They were still them. The disillusionment.

172
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Turn them howling and insufferable.

173
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 According to the author, the celebrities had painted the S of salvation on the door of fame and success, only to find it ultimately disappointing.

174
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 They were still broken. They were still small.

175
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 They were still need in need of a savior.

176
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 On the other hand. Jesus says.

177
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I am the door.

178
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 There is no other door that will lead you to life abundant.

179
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Just like in the sheep, then Jesus stands in the doorway, inviting us in.

180
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 This is the doorway to salvation.

181
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 You may have heard the user an MTR analogy in the past. If you want to ride the MTR, you have to go through turnstile.

182
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Jesus could in Hong Kong in 2022 say, I am the turnstile.

183
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And yet. Many of us think it's too good to be true.

184
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 He invites us in. And we think it's just too simple.

185
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 We don't believe his grace is enough.

186
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 That his invitation is enough.

187
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 The truth is, there are no qualifiers.

188
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 There is no committee. You don't have to submit your grades.

189
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 But what we do is we try and turn it into Jesus plus.

190
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Jesus plus our biblical education.

191
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Jesus plus our church attendance.

192
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Jesus plus our behavior management.

193
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Jesus plus any number of things that we think we need to have life abundantly.

194
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 We shift our weight of expectation away from Jesus and onto the smaller, weaker thing.

195
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And we wind up doing exactly what the Pharisees were doing.

196
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 We are trying to earn God's favor when we already have it.

197
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Jesus has more for us.

198
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He came. To give us life abundantly.

199
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But it's not the kind of abundant life that the world gives.

200
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 When we pass through the true door of salvation, we find abundance of life that transcends our earthly circumstances.

201
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 There is abundant hope. There is abundant joy.

202
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 There is abundant purpose. There is abundant meaning.

203
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 There is abundant contentment. And there is abundant peace.

204
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 He says this. Peace, I leave with you.

205
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 My peace, I give to you. Not as the world gives, do I give to you.

206
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.

207
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 My friends. Jesus. Is the door.

208
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Let me say that again. Jesus. Is the door.

209
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Every other door is a dead end.

210
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And when we pass through him, we pass into abundant, eternal life.

211
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 It's life that transcends the circumstances of this life.

212
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 It's eternal life. And it begins now.

213
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Look at this. And this is the testimony that God gave us eternal life.

214
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And this life is in his son. Whoever has the son has life.

215
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And whoever does not have the son of God does not have life.

216
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 My friends. Jesus. Invites you in.

217
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 You don't need a password. You don't need to pay a toll.

218
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 You don't need to clean yourself up and get your life together first.

219
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 He invites you in just as you are.

220
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 His grace is enough for you and for me.

221
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 You need merely to trust him because he has already done the work.

222
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And he has already cleared the way.

223
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He wants you to give. He wants to give you.

224
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Life. That you have never known.

225
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 My friends. Today.

226
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Is the day.

227
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 But you. Could pass through.

228
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 The door of salvation.

229
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Let me say it one more time.

230
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Today. I'm talking about the 19th of March, 2022.

231
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 At about 630 in the evening.

232
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Today is the day that you can pass through the door of his salvation.

233
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And I want to challenge you right now, whether you're on zoom, whether you're on YouTube.

234
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I want to challenge you.

235
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 To submit. And to give your life to Jesus.

236
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I see two doors in front of you.

237
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 One has got everything the world can give you.

238
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Money, fame, power, you name it.

239
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And it's enticing.

240
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 It's seductive.

241
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 But the other door.

242
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Only Jesus can open.

243
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It is the door to life.

244
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And eternal life.

245
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And the bundle life.

246
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I took that step around 40 years ago.

247
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 And have never for a single moment regretted that.

248
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Yes, I could have had all of that.

249
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 But instead of that, I have this, which is abundant life, which is eternal life.

250
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And it is a totally fulfilled life.

251
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And you can have it right now.

252
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Just close your eyes.

253
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And repeat with me.

254
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Today, Jesus, I choose you.

255
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I choose the door to salvation.

256
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 I know I'm a sinner.

257
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 But Lord Jesus, I believe that you will forgive my sins.

258
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And as I go through that door, I will enter into a new life.

259
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 A life that is abundant.

260
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And a life that will go on forever.

261
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Lord Jesus, I choose right now to open that door.

262
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And what we're going to do now, we're going to ask Florence to come back.

263
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We're going to sing those words.

264
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 I have decided to follow Jesus.

265
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 No turning back.

266
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I pray that for you this evening.

267
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,100
 In Jesus name, amen.
